	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are considering amendment No. 150, in clause 11, page 8, line 9, at end add—"

	<p>	<div class='member'>"Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr McWilliam. The Committee may have observed that Government amendment No. 145 has been circulated, and that in it the Government substantially re-write the beginning of clause 12. We appreciate the Government's courtesy in informing hon. Members of the purport of legislation by way of notes on clauses, and I am sure that all of us would greatly appreciate a note on the amendment telling us: first, why it is necessary; secondly, what use will be made of the regulation-making powers under new subsections (2B) and (2C) of section 30 of the 1986 Act; thirdly, what "the Housing Act functions" of rent officers referred to in the proposed subsection (2A) will be; lastly, whether drafts of any of the relevant regulations that are available could be attached to the note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all members of the Committee would appreciate clarification of those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr McWilliam. We shall of course be as helpful as we can. If we reach clause 12 this afternoon, which does not appear likely, I might
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
find it difficult to fulfil that obligation, but without giving an absolute commitment, I shall cirrculate a note to explain our reasons for tabling the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to say that the point of order is not a point for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment moved by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr Flynn) seeks to extend the amounts that can be disregarded for benefit purposes to include lone parents' childcare costs and so to reintroduce a disregard which existed under the supplementary benefit scheme but was discontinued in April last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put the amendment in a slightly broader context. First, the Government believe that it is for lone parents to decide, in the light of their own circumstances, what arrangements they wish to make for the care of their children. That does not mean that they cannot look to the Government to create a sensible framework within which to take those decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we should acknowledge that valuable help with childcare can be, and is, provided by some employers, and also by voluntary organisations, some of which are supported by Government money. But direct help with childcare costs from the public purse is not available to people in full-time work, and we should not lightly encourage reliance on income support and thereby create disincentives for people to move from income support to greater independence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, while a lone parent does not have to be available for employment in order to receive income support, those lone parents who do part-time work already receive an earnings disregard of £15 a week which, in some circumstances, can be up to £5.50 a week more than they received under the previous supplementary benefit scheme, and it is £10 a week more than the disregard currently available to many other single people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence that is available to the Department about employment expenses of lone parents came from an independent study that we commissioned in 1982. It showed that nearly 78 per cent of working lone parents in the survey incurred no childcare costs at all, and only just over 2 per cent had costs in excess of £10 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is little evidence from the public that the absence of a disregard for childcare costs is having a disincentive effect on lone parents taking up employment. So, I urge the Committee to reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 150 attempts to introduce a specific disregard of childcare costs for lone parents in calculating housing benefit. It is similar to amendment No. 130, and the same arguments apply, so I hope that the Committee will reject it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One general point is relevant to both amendments. Child care costs vary considerably. There are some commercial arrangements available, but many lone parents call on family help or make arrangements with other young mothers to provide childcare while they are at work. Some employers provide creche facilities. The amendment would give the same help to working lone parents, irrespective of whether they have to pay
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0388">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
for childcare. Indeed some lone parents work as child-minders and help other lone parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complicated issue. The revised benefit scheme that we introduced was simpler for claimants to understand and for staff and local authorities to administer. Nevertheless, we are worried about the issue of disregards and are studying their impact on different aspects of the benefit system. We are anxious that lone parents should be able to get back into work if they so wish. I hope that in a broader context of the study of disregards we can find a way of making that option more attractive to them than the existing system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to accept the amendments, which are but a part of a much wider picture on disregards. I ask the Committee to await the outcome of our work on the broader front.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention of the amendment is clear, and we ask for
	<br><blockquote><p>"any sum paid by the claimant".</p></blockquote>
We expect that there would need to be proof of the sum claimed. The Minister said that the money could be claimed by everyone, but it is not our intention that it could be claimed on a pro rata basis in terms of evidence provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many lone mothers face Hobson's choice. Provision of nursery education varies in many parts of the country. In my constituency of Newport it is generous. At one time the figure was 100 per cent and there were vacant places. The aim was to provide at least 75 per cent. That is still the objective and there are many excellent nursery schools, so the matter does not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On many other schemes the Government accept the need to allow childcare costs—for example, for lone parents on employment training. The Minister's answer does not explain away the disincentive of childcare costs for many people. He quoted figures from some years ago—1982. Our experience is that childcare costs and childminding charges are very much higher. Although some people can call on relatives and friends to take care of their children, at least a quarter cannot afford the luxury of working because their income would decrease. Our examples have shown, and the Government have confirmed in answer to questions some time ago asking for a comparison of costs, that there is a disincentive which has not been dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply that he was examining the disregards and the tone of the Secretary of State's comments suggest that perhaps Ministers recognise that there is a major problem. We should prefer it to be dealt with by the amendment, but on the Minister's assurance that the matter is being examined, we look for a change in future. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 131, in page 7, line 41, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In section 32(2)(a) of the Social Security Act 1986, after the words "funeral expenses" there shall be inserted the words "and, in the case of a person to whom section 17(l)(a)(i) of the Social Security Act 1975 applies, any item to which regulation 23 of the Supplementary Benefit (Single Payments) Regulations 1981 would have applied prior to 11th April 1988 and without which he would be unable to
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
take up employment which has been offered to him and any travelling expenses to which regulation 22(l)(e), (f), (g) or (h) would have applied'."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 134, in page 7, line 41, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In section 33(4) of the 1986 Act, after the word 'award' there shall be inserted the words 'other than for the living expenses of a person who has recently entered employment but has not received his first payment of earnings in respect of that employment'."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to change the law so that social fund grants are made available for work-related expenses such as tools, clothing, travel to work or to allow people to take up new work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the social fund, grants or loans are not available for work-related expenses. That is written on tablets of stone in direction numbers 12, 23 and 29 under the Social Security Act 1986, so there is no discretion allowed at local level. The directions are legal requirements, as are most parts of the social fund manual, and many people are prevented from looking for or taking up work because they cannot afford to buy work clothes or tools or pay for travel. Again it is one of what the Government have described as the rigidities of the system. It is one of the disincentives, and it will become an increasing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the old supplementary benefit single payments scale, claimants had a legal right to grants for work-related expenses. Regulation 23 of the supplementary benefit single payment regulations provided that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a single payment should be made in respect of any specified item without which a member of the assessment unit would be unable to either take up employment which had been offered to him or to continue in employment which he had has taken up during the 14 days immediately preceding the making of his claim for a single payment."</p></blockquote>
It is a very sensible rule. The items for which the single payment could be made were basic tools, working clothes, footwear, driving licence, fees for medical examinations required by prospective employers and any other item which cost less than £35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is probably a growing need for that payment as employers become less sensitive to the need for safety than they were and more permissive in their general neglect of many areas of work in which protective clothing is necessary. Where basic equipment is crucial for work, money should be available for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the actively seeking work provisions, it will be crucial that claimants are given financial help to at least fulfil the condition of actively seeking work. At present, claimants cannot obtain any help from the social security system towards the cost of travel to seek work and travel during the first weeks of work before the first pay day, the cost of clothes to go to interviews and to work, or the cost of tools necessary to take up that work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is accepted, people will be able to apply for social fund community care grants, but because of the discretionary nature of the social fund, there will be no guarantee that payments will automatically be made. It will be a question of proving the case and proving the necessity of the grant. The payment will be very much dependent on those paragons, those omnipotent people, the social fund officers, who are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0389">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>661</span>
the repositary of all wisdom on such matters. The buck stops with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department of Social Security guidance on priorities and the state of the local social fund budgets will also be factors It is therefore essential that the social fund guidance manual is amended to give high priority to all unemployed claimants requesting social fund gants for work-related expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 134 addresses the problem of people starting work who may have to wait—they all wait for some time, but some have to wait up to a month—for their first pay day. At present, the only help available is a crisis loan from the social fund. Under the amendment, the payments from the social fund to meet living expenses during that period would not be recoverable, otherwise they would be paid as grants not as loans. That is particularly important, in that someone taking up a job is then faced with the further disincentive of building up a debt which may take many weeks or months to repay. It must act as a disincentive to someone to take up such a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other possible ways of dealing with the problem. A solution would be to pay income support and recover it by deductions from earnings, as is already done when a striker receives income support after returning to work. Compared with the present system of crisis loans, that has the advantage of not being subject to the social fund's cash limits. But, it has the disadvantage of involving employees in the process of recovery. Apart from inconvenience to employers, this would mean disclosing to them that a person has been in receipt of income support. A system of non-recoverable payments therefore seems preferable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). The amendments would extend the provision available to people entering or returning to work after a spell on benefit. However, I advise the Committee not to accept the hon. Gentleman's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 131 provides for payments to be made from the social fund on a regulated basis to an unemployed person for a specified list of work-related expenses without which the individual would be unable to take up employment offered to him. The hon. Gentleman mentioned regulation 23 of the old Supplementary Benefit (Single Payments) Regulations 1981.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I recognise the motives which led Opposition Members to table the amendment, I see it as a substantial step backwards towards the cumbersome and over-complicated framework which pre-dated the reformed system. That system was so complicated that it was difficult for staff, let alone the public outside, to establish whether they were getting that to which they were entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there is division across the Floor of the Committee. Government Members tend to believe that a discretionary system is better than a regulated one, and Opposition Members tend to take the opposite view. I stand by the view that sensible discretion exercised by people who have had proper train-
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
ing in the use of that judgment is the better way to meet exceptional benefit needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it pre-dates my time, I understand that few payments were made under the old Supplementary Benefit (Single Payment) Regulations 1981, which is why it was decided to exclude such payments from the discretionary part of the social fund. I must therefore ask the Committee to reject amendment No. 131.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 134 will have the effect of preventing a social fund officer from determining a social fund award to be repayable if that award relates to a payment for living expenses for a person who has entered employment but has not yet received his first payment of earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here again, I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's arguments since the amendment would result in people who receive a crisis loan for living expenses before entering employment being put in a more advantageous position that anyone else who receives such a loan. The essence of the amendment seems to be to create a new type of supplementary benefit urgent needs payment without pre-requisite—which applied to most of the old regulations—of repayability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new arrangements, because income support is paid fortnightly in arrears, somebody starting work will normally have at least two weeks' money in hand. That should bring people into a cycle to fit their needs. Perhaps some people who are paid monthly will have a longer period to cover and they can apply for a crisis loan from the social fund. Such loans are of course repayable as were most of the old urgent needs payments which they replaced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To accept the amendment would provide for certain social fund crisis loan payments to become non-repayable for the very people whose financial position is likely to have improved as a result of a return to work. This would be unfair to others, perverse in its effect and run counter to the general philosophy of the loan scheme. I must therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The previous cumbersome and overcomplicated scheme has been replaced by one that is equally so. there has been an attempt to simplify it but, in almost every respect, simplification has meant rough justice for many people. A social security scheme which deals with the multifarious problems of people in many and varied circumstances will be complex. But we should prefer certain facets of the previous scheme because, in many respects, the changes in April were a step backwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crisis loan entails many problems in that it is questionable whether it would be awarded. The criterion for the loan is that a person must establish that it is the only means of preventing serious damage or risk to his health or safety or that of his family. That may well be a difficult case to plead under the existing directions. The fact that few awards were made previously might encourage the Minister to accept the proposal on the basis that there will not be an enormous demand. That seems to be the bottom line in most Government decisions. Moreover, it would ease the rigidities in the market which actively discourage people from taking on new jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0390">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
An additional problem is that those starting work will probably use the money for their living expenses for the first two weeks of work. Under the current system, one of the complexities of benefit was ruled out and the simplicity introduced that benefit is paid two weeks in arrears. But the final giro would have to cover the period immediately before someone started work. Therefore, the acceptance and commencement of a new job has been made more difficult, complicated and onerous by the new regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may press the Minister a little further on work expenses. His comments were interesting, but irrelevant. He said that the proposal to reintroduce a consideration of work expenses was a step backwards to a cumbersome system and that the new system was simpler. But, as my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said, it is easy to have a simple system if one withdraws all the benefits to which people might otherwise be entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's other justification was that it was better under the new proposals for the social fund for officers to have sensible discretion, as that would be a better way to meet exceptional needs. It is beyond me how that can be an answer to an amendment which refers precisely to a discretion which officers are forbidden to exercise. The amendment refers to an area where officers have no discretion at all, where the Secretary of State's guidance specifically denies them the opportunity to have any consideration, sensible or otherwise, about making payments for work expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be—we all hope that it is—that only a few people need such basic help to enable them to start work. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West said, if there are only a few, that should make it easier for the Government to reconsider the proposal. Moreover, such help may be extremely important for those people. Only a few days ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) told me about one of her constituents who, after much seeking, was fortunate enough to obtain a job. But, before he could take up that job, he needed not only tools but various items of safety clothing, and so on, which the employer would not provide. That man turned to the DSS in the hope of obtaining assistance and was as astonished as my hon. Friend to discover that such assistance was not available under any circumstances. It is surprising enough that the Government should be so anxious to exclude those expenses from being available under any circumstances. It is even more extraordinary in the context of the Bill. It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the Government have driven away all little nuisances and that we should not bother him with them. The Bill tells people that they must take active steps each week to look for work, be prepared to take temporary work and to work hours that in the past would have been considered part time. People are being told that they must do everything that they can in their search for work, yet the one thing that might assist them to take up the offer of work—some form of assistance with work expenses, basic tools, a driving licence or some such thing—is shrugged off by the Department which says, "Don't bother us with that. It does not concern us." It seems ludicrous that,
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
on the one hand, the Government demand that people seek work and, on the other, decline to give any form of assistance, ruling out the possibility of any help to enable them to take up any work that they find. The Minister's answer did not include this point. I should be grateful if he would consider saying something further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It was not clear whether the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) had resumed his seat or whether the hon. Lady was intervening. If it was an intervention, I would have preferred it to be a bit shorter. If it was not, I presume that the hon. Gentleman had resumed his seat and that the hon. Lady was making a speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding was that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West was about to bring the debate on the amendments to a close. I wished to make observations before he did so. He assures me that I am right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can we sort out this matter for future occasions? I will never deny a member of the Committee the right to speak. That is not the function of the Chair. However, I prefer an intervention to be just that. If the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stand by the number of reasons why I recommended the Committee not to accept the amendment. However, the hon. Lady made a case that calls for further consideration. I cannot accept the amendment, but I shall ask my officials to discuss with officials in the Department of Employment whether they think that anything sensible can be done without our going back to the cumbersome nature of the scheme before April. I understand her point. The Bill is designed to give maximum encouragement to people to return to work. I would not wish it to be a substantial disincentive. Perhaps the officials will be able to find a way forward after discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What makes us bridle about the Bill is the suggestion that the actively seeking work test will be simple. It is so complex and difficult, and throws up so many problems, that it will probably be unworkable in a free society. It will rightly cause many objections from people who are being pursued in this way with impossible demands being made upon them. A new layer of complexity will be added to the system.

As my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said, many people are in that position. If a person has had a prolonged period of unemployment, often he has only informal clothes. He might have to take a job for which he needs new clothes. I recall working in an oil establishment many years ago when there were such things as crepe-soled shoes. They rapidly disintegrated, and we had to wear wooden clogs, which are worn to this day. Many occupations demand expenses to be borne by the work force. It is not less than before, it is much more the case as the unions have become weakened, mainly as a

	<span class='label label-info column'>665</span>
result of Government actions, and the rights of individual workers fewer. Employers are making increasingly heavier demands by reducing wages and insisting that workers provide many essentials for the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must insist that the Minister look at this matter so that the present directive in the manual is changed, and discretion can be exercised locally. In the light of the Minister's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In Schedule 1 to the Income Support (General) Regulations there shall be added the following paragraph—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'23. A person to whom the preceding paragraphs do not apply but whose circumstances are analogous to any circumstances mentioned in one or more of those paragraphs.'."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will be as cooperative on these amendments as he was on the previous group. The amendments relate to people who have worked extremely hard for most of their lives and whose health is now damaged, often because of that work. They were protected under the old supplementary benefit system but are not protected under the income support system. If the amendments are not accepted, the Bill will require those people to hunt for work or to prove that they are hunting for work every week, even though they have absolutely no chance of getting work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 seeks to restore a provision under 6(e) of the Supplementary Benefit (Conditions of Entitlement) Regulations 1981. The amendment provides that people should be exempted from the requirement to hunt for work on a weekly basis. The amendment shows that people would have to prove that for 12 months they had tried hard to find work before they could benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Past practice was to help those not considered by their general practitioners to be completely incapable because of a medical condition, but who had no realistic prospect of securing employment because of their physical or mental disability. Their disablement had to be the significant or main cause, but not necessarily the sole cause, of their lack of prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There were several commissioners' decisions on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
matter—for example in R(SB)/5/87, the tribunal of commissioners said that the claimant must have no realistic prospect of securing employment rather than only poor prospects. They also felt that age could be analagous to physical or mental disablement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who have worked hard, often on low pay—for example, women hospital workers with damaged backs and men injured by working in furnaces—are entitled to sickness benefit for a time. The regional medical officer then certifies them as capable of carrying out light work, and they are caught in a trap. Light work presumably means office or shop work, and shop work might cause problems because of the amount of standing that is involved. However, given their age, qualifications and training, they cannot obtain such work. While it is accepted that their health is damaged, they are assessed as capable of work. They are therefore knocked off sickness benefit and pushed on to income support. If the amendment is not accepted they will be required, on a weekly basis, to prove that they are hunting for non-existent light work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 5 is the only paragraph in the schedule that allows people with disability or long-term illness not to sign on as available for work in order to get income support. But paragraph 5 applies only to people who are incapable of work, which means those who are covered by a GP's certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 1 is too harsh and too limited. It does not allow for people with disabilities or take into account the practical considerations of those who have no realistic prospect of finding work and who have been unemployed for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, there is no provision for people who are not considered by their general practitioner or regional medical officer to be totally incapable of work. Indeed, and this is the catch, those fit for light work do such work. I see many such people in my advice bureau. There is no provision for people with permanent disabilities who must use a wheelchair, although they are capable of light work. In a decent economy with a decent labour market, many of those people would be found adequate employment with the support that they need. However, in the harsh world in which we live, that is absolutely out of the question. The fact that someone has been unsuccessful in his or her search for work in the previous 12 months should be ample proof that there is no realistic prospect of finding work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some facts from Coventry that illuminate the possible consequences of the amendment and the effect of the change from the old supplementary benefit provisions to the current income support provisions. Between August 1987 and April 1988 over 1,000 unemployed men and women were assessed by the DHSS or by social security appeal tribunals as having no prospect of future employment due to their age or state of health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In accordance with regulation 6(e) and (u) of the Supplementary Benefit (Conditions of Entitlement) Regulations 1981 they were exempted from having to sign on and be available for employment as a condition of receiving supplementary benefit. Incidentally, they became entitled to the long-term rate of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0392">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
supplementary benefit. That was an extra £10 a week which was, of course, abolished by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When income support replaced supplementary benefit in April they were once more required to register for employment and to be available for work. Under clause 7, these same men and women, who have already been officially designated as having no pros pect of employment, will only receive benefit if they go through the humiliation and degradation of applying for jobs which the state has already accepted they have no prospect of obtaining. I say seriously to the Sec retary of State, to the Minister</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hope springs eternal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We used to think that the Minister was rather better than other Ministers but if he can bring this Bill to the House perhaps we were deluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the Bill on people who have worked hard for most of their lives, often in low-paid jobs; whose health has been damaged in the process; who have been certified as capable of light work; who live in a labour market where such light work is not available, will be one of the cruellest faces of the legislation, and if the Minister makes no provision for such people, the Bill will be brought into even greater disrepute than would otherwise be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 provides for a similar group of people and again tries to reinstate a provision that used to exist under the supplementary benefit regulations by using the funny word "analogous". Schedule 1 of the income support regulations prescribes for a person who does not have to sign on as available for work to qualify for income support. It is more restrictive than the list that existed under regulation (6) of the supplementary benefit regulations. In particular, at the end of that regulation paragraph (u) allowed for the requirement to be available for work to be waived if the person's circumstances were analogous to any of those listed in the preceding paragraphs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph (u), however, could not be applied if someone was specifically excluded by any of the other paragraphs. In R(SB)5/87 the tribunal of commissioners said that to be analogous a person's situation must be so similar that it would be similarly unreasonable to expect that person to sign on for employment. This discretion is needed because schedule 1 does not allow for all the circumstances in which it is unreasonable to expect a person to be available for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, paragraph 4 waives the requirement for a carer to sign on only when the carer gets invalid care allowance or when the person cared for has claimed or is getting attendance allowance. There is no provision for carers of people with disabilities who cannot get attendance allowance, such as people with severely disabled children under the age of two, a disabled person who has been refused attendance allowance because of the stricter night time rules and stricter application of the test, or the person who is pursuing a review of that refusal on appeal to the commissioners that has taken longer than 26 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
I am dealing with the case of a woman whose leg has been amputated and who cannot go to the toilet or up to her bedroom without assistance. Her husband, who is 60 or 61, gave up a good job with Lucas in Birmingham because there was no other way of looking after her. The couple have been refused attendance allowance and invalid care allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill the husband, who is a hard-working man who has given up his job to care for his wife and reduced the family income considerably would be required actively to seek work on a weekly basis unless the Minister makes a concession on the basis of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People with impaired sight will also be affected. A person has to be registered blind for the requirement to be available to be waived under paragraph 8. Regulation 6(d) of the supplementary benefit regulations allows the requirement to be waived if the person's loss of or impaired eyesight means that he or she cannot perform work for which eyesight is essential. The income support rule is therefore more restrictive. It debars people who are registered as partially sighted and people who prefer not to be registered as blind as they feel that there is a stigma attached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been disappointed by the Minister several times during the past few days. The number of people involved is small, the potential cost of the amendments to the Government would be limited and the hardship under the Bill if it is not amended will be great. I hope and expect that the Minister will make some concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that once again I must disappoint the hon. Member for Birmingham, Lady wood (Ms. Short). In moving the amendments she commendably sought to make more sympathetic and, she would say, responsive treatment available to people who experience special difficulties in obtaining employment. I shall explain why it would be wrong to accept either of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, unless a person is sick, over pension age, or otherwise exempted, he must be available for work in order to receive income support. As the hon. Lady says, schedule 1 of the Income Support (General) Regulations gives a list of those exemptions. It includes claimants aged 60 or over and those aged over 50 who have not been working for 10 years and who are therefore not required to be available and who have no reasonable prospects of employment. It also covers claimants who are unfit for work and who provide supporting evidence of incapacity. I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady but I am not convinced that we should go further. Obviously, we are not in the business of insisting that those who are unlikely to find work because they are wholly unfit for it should be forced to register and seek work. Nor is it reasonable to expect those nearing retirement and with little prospect of employment to join the labour market, but existing arrangements already provide for them. We have already said that regulations about actively seeking work will provide for adjudication officers to take account of a claimant's circumstances, including his capacity both for the sort of work that is available and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0393">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
for undertaking the type of search that might secure a job in that field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be right or sensible to write off people who have some limitations on their health or capacities, or who may have been out of work for a period as short as nine months. They should be entitled to counselling, training and encouragement to enable them to get back into employment. The employment service is doing all that it can by way of advice and training to help people with special needs to get back into the labour market. This will help them, and we may need their skills. I accept the need to apply the new arrangements sensitively and I have given a commitment to do so. We want to increase the feeling of self-worth of people with disabilities, health problems or other disadvantages by enabling them to get back to work if possible. I cannot accept amendment No. 132.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 relates to the rather difficult concept of the analogous circumstances that existed under the old system, and I think that it is unnecessary. Careful thought was given to the categories that should be covered in regulations so as to avoid the head for analogous circumstances provision. The Committee will recall my remarks about the regulations that we shall introduce covering people actively seeking work. The steps that people will need to take will reflect their individual circumstances as well as the local job market. These would be better covered by the provisions in the Bill than if we returned to the analogous circumstances provisions. Therefore I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why I live in hope any longer. The Minister has not given an undertaking to make special provision for these people in his famous regulations that we have not seen, and will not see before Report. The Minister said that he would not accept the amendments because he does not wish to write people off from the counselling, training, encouragement and help to get back into the labour market which the Bill provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Words have meanings and it is an assault on the English language to describe as help and encouragement regulations that will hurt and harass. The Bill relates to so many people, including those who have put in a lifetime of hard work, suffered injury, received sickness benefit for a time and been told that they are capable of light work, who live in an economy in which there is no chance of obtaining light work. It provides that they will have to prove each week that they have sought work or face the threat off losing all benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also listened carefully to the Minister. He said, as he always does, that he hopes that this part of the Bill will be administered with sensitivity and that people will be given the opportunity to explain their difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person might make a good case, in the kind of circumstances outlined by my hon. Friend, for being unable actively to seek work because he must care for someone, but he might be unable to meet the provisions which the Government have restricted; now, the only real recognition of disability is the receipt of
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
attendance allowance and invalid care allowance. In these circumstances, that person is unlikely to receive sympathetic treatment, but will be ruled as unavailable for, or not actively seeking, work. Such efforts to obtain a sympathetic hearing are likely to render him deprived of all right to benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We have said this before. When the Minister says that his officials will carefully help people through the system and that anyone whose benefit will be stopped will be warned weeks in advance, he gives an assurance that breaches the Bill's provisions. It is clear from the Bill that the test does not take place over weeks and months; it is not cumulative, it is weekly. The fact that someone sought work in any one week does not prove or disprove that he did, or would do, so in other weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gives an assurance that is illegal or breaches the Bill's provisions. What will the officials do? They will either breach the spirit of the law—which, in effect, the Minister invites them to do at the same time as he schizophrenically asks us to approve the legislation—or they must use extreme cruelty to deal with people living in the distressing circumstances that I described. The best officials will probably try to find a way around a cruel law. But that is no way to form our law or to ask our officials to behave. The ones who fail will throw up some of the harsh and terrible cases which will embarrass the Government in the press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If not surprising, the Government's response is disappointing and I suggest to my hon. Friends that we vote for the amendment to be part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
The amendment relates to changing regulations for income support and premium payments for people seeking asylum in this country. It is designed to clear up an unfair anomaly in the Social Security Act 198$. Indeed, many of the characters who performed in the proceedings on the 1988 legislation are here for a re-play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue of asylum seekers is important, although the numbers involved are not large. The 1951 United Nations Geneva convention states that those seeking asylum must have a well-founded fear of persecution in their own country. In other words, the judgment is not on the political system or political situation in the country from which the asylum seeker comes but on the safety or otherwise of that person. It is not a matter of value judgments about particular societies but about whether such a person has a well-founded fear of persecution in his own country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Usually, asylum seekers arrive in this country, because an application can only be made at the port of arrival. The application is dealt with by the Home Office—the average time taken for that process is 15 months, but some applications take much longer. Indeed, in some cases in my constituency it has taken two or three years before there has been a resolution to an application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, the Home Office grants not political asylum but, increasingly exceptional leave to remain which, of course, could be revoked at a future date. People must usually re-apply annually, and sometimes on a six-monthly basis, for exceptional leave to remain. In an answer to the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) on 14 March 1988, the Minister of State, Home Office stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For applications decided in 1987 it is estimated that the average length of time between the receipt of the application and the decision was 10 months for those applying at ports of entry and 16 months for those already in the United Kingdom."—	<i>[OfficialReport,</i> 14 March 1988; Vol. 129, c.420.]</p></blockquote>
Since then, it has got worse and the application time now takes much longer. I mention that because the time taken to regulate matters in respect of such a person has a bearing on social security regulations, as the Minister understands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the current regulations, income support for someone seeking political asylum is, essentially, cut by 10 per cent when compared with that received by all other applicants. Moreover, asylum seekers are not allowed to receive premiums. Let us compare a single parent, with a five-year-old child, who is seeking political asylum with one who is not. A single parent applicant for income support would receive a payment of f44.15 a week, plus £6.15 a week family premium and £3.70 lone parent premium—a total weekly income of £54. An asylum seeker would receive £40.81 per week—that represents a 10 per cent reduction in income support. In other words, he would receive 90 per cent, of the income support but none of the family or other premiums applicable to other applicants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the restriction of the 90 per cent rule for asylum seekers and allow all premiums payable to anyone else within the income support regulations to be made payable to them. In other
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
words, someone seeking political asylum who was eligible to receive income support would receive it on exactly the same basis as anyone else. I see no reason why the amendment should not be accepted and the regulations changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister will know, there is considerable disquiet on the subject. I quote from a letter that he wrote last April to Lord Chitnis, the chairman of the British Refugee Council, on the back of the Bill that had just gone through the House at that time:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Thank you for your letter of 16 September about the social security benefits"</p></blockquote>
the letter was written late last year, but it was about what happened in April 1988
	<br><blockquote><p>"which will be available to refugees and asylum seekers … I should say at the outset that policy for income support and the social fund is now settled, and the proposed regulations have been published. In addition, instructions and training material on the basis of this policy have already been issued to our local office staff. I am unable therefore to make any changes at this stage, but I will explain our views on the particular matters you raise in your letter and if you would still like to meet and discuss this issue I will be happy to do so.</p></blockquote>
"5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the important part of the letter:
	<br><blockquote><p>"You are concerned about our intention to pay benefit at 90 per cent of the normal rate to asylum seekers whilst their application to be allowed to stay is being considered by the Home Office. However, this does not entail any discrimination against asylum seekers, as it will also apply to other people—including British citizens—who are no; entitled to income support under the normal rules but are nevertheless allowed access to benefit because of their special circumstances. The logic of the 10 per cent abatement is that there is no point in having rules which exclude people from benefit in certain circumstances (eg people admitted to the country temporarily or with limited leave) but then allow them full benefit anyway if they are in need".</p></blockquote>
I am not sure that I fully understand the logic of that reply, and I hope that the Minister will explain it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 20 July last year, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths) asked
	<br><blockquote><p>"the secretary of State for Social Services why his Department is restricting the allowances to refugees who have sought sanctuary in the United Kingdom to 90 per cent of income support; if he will give the numbers of refugees who have submitted claims to the Department of Health and Social Security and have received payments at only 90 per cent of income support since April; if he has plans to review this policy; and if he will make a statement."</p></blockquote>
I shall not give the whole of the written answer, but this is the important part:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The reason for the abatement is that there would be no point in having rules which exclude people from benefit in certain situations if they could obtain full benefit by virtue of the urgent cases rules.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>All instances in which urgent cases payments are made to people from abroad are notified by local social security offices to the office of the chief adjudication officer (OCAO). In the period 6 April-30 June 1988 OCAO received information about 613 new cases."—	<i>{Official Report,</i> 20 July 1988; Vol. 137, 	<i>c.669–780.]</i></p></blockquote>
If we take that as an annual average, it represents about 2,400 cases a year—not a massive number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who come to this country seeking asylum do so because they are desperate. The United Nations convention of 1951 is supposed to govern the standards of decision that are taken on asylum application by all signatory countries—we are a signatory country—and it is not the responsibility of other Government
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
Departments to have a hand in the quality of decisions taken or, in my view, in how those people are treated. The application for political asylum should stand on its merits, but behind the way that the regulations operate I see a disincentive towards those people or some sort of punishment. I do not understand the motives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have a thought for the asylum seeker. People who seek political asylum in another country do not do so lightly. It is not a light move to take. Often, their situation back home is very desperate. I think of the person who has fled recently from Iran and crossed the border into Iraq and then into another country, or vice versa from Iraq into Iran and then into Pakistan and eventually here or elsewhere. It is a dangerous move. The boat people from Vietnam have suffered a great deal, sometimes at the hands of pirates on the high seas, and people who have left Chile and other countries have also suffered.

It is important for us to have a system that recognises political asylum and the needs of those who seek it. As a country that has been prepared to consider and accept genuine cases into political asylum, we should treat such people properly during the time when their applications are considered, and my amendment would remove the pointed discrimination against them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been said at various times about the number of people who seek political asylum in the United Kingdom. The debate is not about the principle of political asylum or about whether certain people should be granted political asylum, it is about the cost that is involved. In that sense, and in that sense only, I shall give figures for the numbers of people who apply. Compared with many other European countries, the United Kingdom receives relatively few asylum seekers, both in absolute numbers and in relation to its population. Between 1984 and 1986, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Belgium, France and the Netherlands all received more applications than did the United Kingdom. Of the 10 main refugee-receiving countries in Europe, the United Kingdom received by far the fewest number of asylum applications in proportion to its population, and I shall give the figures. All of which come from Home Office sources. In Britain, the average number of asylum seekers per 1 million inhabitants a year over the period 1984–86 is 80; in Norway, it is 315; in West Germany, it is 1,117; in Sweden, it is 1,598. So no one can accuse the British Government of being generous in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the number of those who have been granted political asylum, taking the ratio of refugees to the population as a whole? In Britain, it is 1:400—that is people whose origins here were as refugees, although some may have gained British nationality over the course of time. In Sweden, it is 1:195—that means that there are more than twice as many refugees in Sweden as there are here. The figures for poorer countries are quite frightening: in Iran, it is one in 20, but that is very much a consequence of the war, and I am not advocating that anyone here should seek political asylum in Iran; in Pakistan, it is one in 36, and no doubt that is a product of the war in Afghanistan; in Jordan, as a product of the middle east crisis, one in four of the population is recognised as a refugee. So the pro
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
portion, the numbers and the costs are very small in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister and the Government recognise that when people come here from other countries—examples are the people who came here before the war from Nazi Germany, those who came after the war from eastern Europe during the upheavals at that time,.or those who have come from Chile and other countries—they have left an appalling crisis generally and one in which their own individual lives have been threatened. They are vulnerable. Often they have serious language difficulties. In asking that the regulations be amended, we do not want life to be made over easy for such people; we seek merely to redress what is, I hope, an anomaly in the Social Security Act 1988, and ask that they be treated the same as anyone else who needs income support while their applications are dealt with. The numbers involved are very small, the principle is an important one, and I hope that the Minister will accept the need for this amendment, which has wide support within the British refugee camps and with a number of organisations that deal with refugees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) said, the amendment would apply to asylum seekers and to other groups such as seasonal workers and those in receipt of an income which was temporarily interrupted. However, the main thrust of the amendment relates to those seeking asylum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood that the Minister was changing the regulations relating to seasonal workers which is why I did not refer to them when I introduced the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a third category are those whose income has been interrupted and who therefore need income support. In essence, they are people such as those from abroad who are not entitled to income support or those who are entitled to less because their normal income was taken into account in judging their entitlement. Either way, they do not satisfy the usual conditions for receiving benefit. The existing regulations ensure that if they would suffer hardship they will receive a regular, if reduced, income. That reflects the fact that they are not strictly entitled to benefit. The reduction is not merely because they seek asylum; it applies to others too. The Home Office decides whether to grant asylum and I accept that there are delays in taking those decisions. I do not criticise the Home Office; it is a complex and time-consuming business that has caused anxiety on both sides of the House about the rule. The social security system under which the abatement of 10 per cent, is applied is taken in isolation and does not influence the Home Office decision on the status of an asylum seeker. It accepts that no decision has been taken and that in the interim the individual is not entitled to income support. None the less, reduced help is given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Urgent payments are made from the first day of the claim. They are calculated at 90 per cent, of the personal allowance, plus any pensioner premium, plus the full rate for any children, plus help with relevant housing costs and the full entitlement to housing benefit.

homes is slightly different. That is the underlying principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A cost would be involved in the amendment because those affected are not strictly entitled to income support and money is paid to them only because we acknowledge that they need support because of hardship. I cannot accept the amendment today, but I have received representations from Members on both sides of the House. I have undertaken to think about the underlying principle and the cost implications and to consider whether it might be appropriate to make changes. I cannot go further than that today and if the hon. Gentleman presses the amendment to a Division, I shall ask my hon. Friends to vote against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the Minister has prepared for the debate and that his official have considered the issue.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the time that it takes the Home Office to decide. It varies from case to case.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take it that in considering whether to make changes, the Minister will include discussions and meetings with hon. Members who are concerned about the matter and I hope that he will undertake to meet a delegation from the British Refugee Council, which feels strongly about the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I received a deputation under the chairmanship of Lord Chitnis from the British Regugee Council, the umbrella body.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's remarks and his understanding of the strength of feeling on the issue, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee as we have already discussed amendments to the clause. However, clause 10 should not pass without my putting on record that we are talking about the loss of entitlement to the most basic and inadequate income, based on a test not of whether people are available for work
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
but of whether they are actively seeking work in any given week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) said, although the climate in which that test is undertaken may be influenced by past events it will be judged week by week, and if that test is failed someone may lose entitlement to the most basic income. The Minister says that there will be warnings, but they are not included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate that we drift towards talking about a job or training offer. The tests do not need to be made against any offer, they can operate in the abstract. They are tests of intention, approach or willingness to work. They are tests of the person not of whether work or a training place exists or might be offered. It is possible to fail those tests without having had a realistic offer of training or work, let alone decent or suitable training at a fair rate of pay or with fair conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who fail that new and stringent test may lose their own income entitlement and their families, the innocent parties, may lose their entitlement too. We sought, in a variety of proposals, to highlight the way in which the Government and their immediate Conservative predecessor tightened or reduced the support available to people suffering hardship. Against that background of harsher provisions in cases of hardship, we tried to persuade the Government that in view of the potentially harsh test, there should be a fresh look at any resulting hardship. These days, benefit is paid in arrears and people might face hardship for a substantial period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must place on record that we have made no significant headway with the Government. They remain determined, as they were last year, to enact legislation that will seriously damage the prospects of vulnerable young people. Last year, we told the Government that that would happen, but they went ahead with legislation that, had precisely that effect. This year we are telling the Government—we take no pleasure in doign so—that the Bill, and particularly clause 10, will affect a person's right to the most basic income of all and will cause enormous hardship, anger, anxiety, ill-feeling and distress. One can use all the adjectives to describe the conditions, because devastation will be caused. That will be the culmination of what the Government seek to do in the Bill. That devastation will lie clearly and straightforwardly at the Government's door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take no pleasure in saying that and I profoundly hope that I am mistaken. In the past, we have heard about attempted suicides and successful suicides because of the effects of the combination of unemployment and social security law. Unfortunately, I have little doubt that they will occur as a consequence of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to take a lot of time, but we have raised many important issues in our amendments to clause 10 and it is important for us to bring ourselves back to the central meaning of the clause, the impact it will have on people and the reasons why we object to it.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
Clauses 7, 8, 9 and 10 are the guts of the employment Bill that this Social Security Bill really is because the Government have deliberately implemented it to reorganise the labour market. Opposition Members have presented a coherent case against this move. Amendments to clause 7 concerned unemployment benefit, but clause 10 applies conditions to those who are receiving income support. It deals with a much larger group of people, who are vulnerable to the provisions in the Bill, and will have profound consequences on their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put on record again what the Bill is all about. The Government are not merely being mean to the poor and harassing the unemployed because the Conservative party has an instinct—we see it every year at the party conference—to denounce everyone who receives benefit as a scrounger. The Bill is a consequence not of such a crude emotional input but of a deep-laid, thoroughly thought-out strategy, which underpins its provisions. The Bill will force people into low paid work rather than receiving benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already listed a long series of measures for the record and I will not repeat them. The Government are encouraging low pay and think that that will encourage efficiency. They have been fantastically successful because we now have 2 million more low paid workers in Britain. According to the Council of Europe decency threshold, an astonishing 49 per cent of our entire work force is low paid, earning less than £145 for a full working week or £3.80 or £3.90 an hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government constantly tell us about our wonderful prosperity. We are the 15th richest country in the world and yet in our so-called prosperous economy, 49 per cent of people in work are low paid by any international definition, which means that their gross pay for a full-time job is less than £145 a week. There is no question but that the Bill will increase their number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The joint provisions require people actively to seek work on a weekly basis and they take away a provision that has existed throughout post-war legislation. Governments of both parties know that everyone should take a job if a suitable one is offered. No one is in favour of anyone living on benefits when there is suitable work available. That has never been a contest between the parties about that and no possibility existed under previous law for individuals to take that course. We are now moving away from that. The word "suitable" is being removed, which means that no one can refuse a job whatever the level of pay on offfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have refused an amendment to stop people being forced to take a job if the pay is lower than the benefit to which they were otherwise entitled. That is what we are moving towards. The Government have found it necessary to make provision not to force anyone to take a job of less than 24 hours a week otherwise they would face the real embarrassment of people with dependant children having to accept such a low income, and not be entitled to family credit, that families would be reduced to absolute penury overnight. Even this Government would be embarrassed by that, which is why we have the provision that a job offer must be for at least 24 hours a week. However, there are no conditions about the level of income that must be paid. In fact, it is explicitly provided, given that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
Minister has refused to use the regulation-making powers that are available to him, that no one may refuse a job whatever level of pay is offered. We can think of extreme cases where employers could insist on registering jobs with jobcentres for 24 hours a week at 50p an hour. Under the provisions in the Bill, an individual would not be entitled to refuse that job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about a set of nasty accidents. The issue is not about people being distressed, hurt and humiliated, which undoubtedly will happen, it is about a further reorganisation of the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More of the work force will be working for low pay, and more people will find that getting a job is no longer an escape from the poverty of living on benefits, a chance for a leg up in the world and the opportunity to improve their lives. More people will be harassed off benefits into work that is so low paid that there will be no escape or improvement in the quality of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At least people with dependent children will be able to bring their income up to some minimum poverty line because of their entitlement to family credit, but those without dependent children have no guarantee whatsoever that they will not be forced to work for less than their current benefit levels, low as they may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an enormously undesirable way to run the country. It is generally understood that people across the land—the prosperous and the less prosperous—are becoming more worried that the country is becoming increasingly divided. They are unhappy about living in such a society and feel that the quality of life would be better if there were justice, fairness and a roughly equal chance for people. But this legislation will make the position worse. It is bad for those who are victims of the system and it is incredibly bad for the economy. Competition by wage cutting will not bring prosperity to the British economy. Competition by wage cutting means bad employment standards, low investment, poor training and a high labour turnover. As we go to the increasingly international competitive market that will come with 1992, the Government's policy of encouraging low pay, which is further encouraged by the Bill, will mean that our economy is disadvantaged in attempting to compete in the sharp and competitive market post-1992.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what the legislation is about, and clause 10 is the worst example of that. It will affect most people who are currently on income support because they will be forced into low-paid work. We profoundly disagree in terms of social justice and in terms of running on efficient economy. That is why we reject clause 10.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not take long, partly because my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is like a greyhound in the slips straining for the start of clause 11 and anxious to get to grips with the arguments on that and partly because I doubt that such eloquence as I can summon up will be enough to convince Opposition Members to support clause 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I not only hope but believe that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Lady wood (Ms. Short) is mistaken in her calculation of the effect of the provision. In these clauses, which form the heart of the Bill, no one is suggesting for a moment that the majority of people who are unemployed or on benefit are scroungers.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0398">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
They need help. As the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) acknowledged, there are scroungers in the system, but that is not the suggestion in the clause. Under the tightening employment prospects and the advantages that flow to people as individuals from being in work rather than receiving benefit, we believe it right to use the test of actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The combination of the tax and benefit changes that the Government have brought about make it almost impossible that anyone will be worse off in employment that on benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that it will be impossible for someone with dependants who takes up an entitlement to family credit to be worse off than if he or she were on benefit? Will the Minister accept that people without dependants and who are not entitled to family credit can be worse off under the Bill than on benefit, and that some will be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There could be some but, because of the combination of changes to the tax system as well as to the benefit system, they will be only a handful. The introduction of family credit has helped those with families. Far from being a subsidy to bad employers, as the hon. Member for Ladywood seems to imagine, family credit is a sensible recognition of the costs of bringing up children for people in lower paid work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made the arguments and will only repeat them in shorthand. The state has a role in helping, counselling and training people and in creating economic conditions in which employment is more available. We all rejoice in the fact that unemployment has come down for 30 successive months. It is not unreasonable for the state to say that, in return for our part of the bargain, we expect those on benefit to take active steps to get themselves into employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hearing that has created an appetite, Mr. McWilliam. I beg to move amendment No. 147, in clause 11, page 8, line 9, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) In section 31 of the 1986 Act, after subsection (1) there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) The Secretary of State shall supply to authorities general guidance on the implementation of any change in the housing benefit scheme not less than six months, or such shorter time as authorities or organisations representing them may agree, before the change is due to be implemented.'.".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 147 relates to housing benefit and housing benefit subsidy. It would impose some restraint on the Government. Clause 11 proposes to penalise local authorities by withholding or estimating subsidy, perhaps to the authority's disadvantage^—there is that implied threat—if it has not supplied to the Secretary of State prescribed particulars within the prescribed period. This again is a matter of regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities receive variable amounts of subsidy depending on the payment. They receive a subsidy for implemenation and administrative costs which is calculated by a complicated formula based on estimates of the administration costs and the number of people in a local authority area who receive housing benefit. They also receive a subsidy of 97 per cent of actual expenditure on most housing benefit, with the exception of backdated benefit, on which they receive only 25 per cent and expenditure on discretionary extra benefit which is paid in exceptional cases—usually hardship cases—under regulation 69(8) of the Housing Benefit (General Regulations) 1987. On that they receive no subsidy. Apart from those two areas, 97 per cent of actual expenditure is eligible for subsidy. Local authorities also receive 15 per cent of expenditure on benefit overpaid as a result of a local authority's error and 25 per cent of expenditure overpaid as a result of error by individual claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have justified the payment of subsidy at rates lower than actual expenditure as being an incentive to more efficient administration. In practice, however, local authorities are penalised in two ways—first, when they make payments that are legal and, secondly, when they mistakenly make wrong payments because of poor provision of information, usually be the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When local authorities make backdated payments, overpayments or discretionary payments, they are legally entitled—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0399">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am finding it difficult to follow the hon. Lady. We are talking about amendment No. 147, are we not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was under that inpression, Mr. McWilliam. I am identifying reasons why it will be necessary for local authorities to have six months' warning of what the Government will deduct. Local authorities are legally entitled to make backdated payments for up to one year, and usually do so in cases of hardship or where a claimant has, in their view good cause for a late claim. They do not make overpayments of benefit on purpose. By definition, most authorities are reluctant to, and have no reason to, make overpayments of benefit. This is certainly so if there is a case of difficulty for an authority. Sometimes overpayments are inevitable because the computer run has started and benefit payments are made before information on changes of circumstances can be fed into the system. It is not a local authority's fault if a claimant is overpaid because he provided incorrect information or delayed notifying a change of circumstances. Despite the fact that these payments are within the law, local authorities are penalised. This can be costly for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Authorities have the discretion to pay extra housing benefit if their circumstances are exceptional, under regulations, and they can spend up to 0.1 per cent of their budget on these payments. As to the sums involved, in a borough such as Newham, which has a population of 200,000 and 35,000 housing benefit claimants, £33,000 can be spent under the regulations. But there is no subsidy for a payment under this provision, so each fl spent has to be paid by the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities often receive reduced subsidy because of the Government's failure to provide information promptly. The major reason why authorities are late in providing information to the Secretary of State is that their computer systems are programmed to provide the required information. The reason for this is that the Secretary of State did not tell local authorities what programmes they were supposed to devise until much too late and much too near the time the programme should run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities need regulations and guidance to produce their computer programs, but these days the information is produced just before the programs have to be implemented. That will be the experience of many members of the Committee. Many local authorities, including mine, has had tremendous difficulties. At least 80 to 90 local authorities have had problems because the Government have produced the regulations so late, and some of the companies that supply software were unable to meet the requirements in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many areas, including mine, hundreds and, in some unfortunate cases, thousands of pounds of rent and rate arrears have built up because people were not given the correct information. Some of my constituents are in great distress. Well informed and intelligent residents knew that they had to make payments over and above last year's level because they read about the Government's housing benefit cuts. They inquired of the local authority, but it did not have the information necessary to answer their questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
Local authority officers did their best and, on the basis of the Government's propaganda, advised people what extra payments they thought would be required. In fact, the Government's cuts are much more massive than the officers of my authority, at least, assumed. People who made extra payments in good faith, believing that they were meeting their obligations, have now built up arrears of hundreds of pounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, local authorities will get reduced subsidy if they do not provide information to the Secretary of State within the prescribed time limits, which are—set out in clause 12,1 have not had time to study the detail of the Government's amendment to see how far it will change the present provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often, local authorities cannot provide information because the Government have not issued regulations. The most recent example, which directly affects subsidy, is the lack of information from the Government on the housing subsidy benefit rules for the new system of market rents set by the rent officer. The new rules are due to begin operation in April 1989—a little more than a month away. Local authorities received a letter from the Department on the subsidy rules for the system in February 1989, although it was dated 31 January. They still have not received the subsidy order containing detailed regulations on the rent officer's subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, on 21 February, local authorities, which under the Bill will be penalised if they do not provide information to the Government, have not received Government guidance on changes that they are supposed to make this April. That is classic. The delays and problems arose because the regulations for implementing the Social Security Act 1986, which introduced a completely new housing benefit scheme, were not available sooner. As it was an enabling Bill the regulations contained all the detail of how the scheme would work, but they were not available until November 1987 and had to be implemented in April 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from that experience and the fact that local authorities still do not have the details of what they are expected to do this April, there is the minor matter of regulations on the community charge benefit scheme, which is due to come into operation in April 1990. Local authorities are desperately worried that, as the Bill stands, they will be penalised for being unable to implement housing benefit schemes when the fault and failure are the Government's and not theirs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State shall supply to authorities general guidance on the implementation of any change in the housing benefit scheme not less than six months"</p></blockquote>
If the period is to be shorter, as it always has been, the shorter time should be agreed by and with local authorities and their organizations

Mr. McWilliam, I thought yesterday morning that we would move straight to clause stand part—until we discovered a string of amendments nestling on the amendment paper for the Employment Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great sympathy with the argument behind the amendment. I recognise that there is concern and accept the need for timely and thorough consultation with local authorities on changes in the housing benefit scheme. There is already an efficient forum involving officials and representatives of local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) dwelt on what has been going wrong. She has been hewing at that coalface for considerably longer than I have, so I shall not correct her on any particular detail. I accept that, during the past couple of years, there have been a great many changes which have put much strain on local authorities and Government Departments trying to get matters right. The 1988 reforms, which were largely produced by the 1986 Act, came into effect in April. My memory is that a draft set of regulations was issued in May 1987—not six months before they came into effect, as the amendment would require, but 11 months beforehand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final draft became available only in November 1987, but there were not many changes to the draft regulations, especially in the latter period. The draft was not laid until November because it had to contain the benefit rates before it was in the proper form to be submitted formally to the House, but the information in the regulations and their requirements on local authorities were known well before November. The fact that the regulations were formally placed on the Table only then is no reason to say that the Government were slow and did not give local authorities proper notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discussions on the present regulations involving rent officers opened in January 1988. The administrative requirements of the change have long been known to local authorities and do not impose any great or complicated burden. The complexity lies in the regulations and instructions for rent officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South refered to computer programs not being ready. I am aware of the problems of some local authorities which say that they will be unable to handle the new arrangements in April. There have been regular discussions between the Department and local authorities, but only recently has the Department been informed that some authorities have a major problem. The exchanges work both ways. It is reasonable for the Department to expect that local authorities will alert it to problems during these regular meetings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) wishes to intervene, I believe. He looks genuinely greyhound like, so I shall give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to snap at the Minister's heels. It is not simply a question of there being two parties to the agreement—the Government and local authorities—and a question of administration and computers. One problem is the fact that people are not aware of where they stand as regards their income, so they have gone individually, and per
	<span class='label label-info column'>684</span>
sonally, or written, to find out where they stand. Local councils and Members of Parliament have been overwhelmed by people who have tried to find out their position with regard to housing benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent who came to see me on Saturday has struggled for months—letters have been going backwards and forwards to the special unit in Glasgow—to discover why money is still outstanding. Finally, he has received the reply that the rules of the game have been changed again. No wonder no one understands the regulations—they have changed so often. There has not simply been a computer error or an administrative difficulty—many people do not know where they stand and have had to go in person for advice. That has been more difficult than the Government anticipated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand the point that the hon. Member for Leeds, West makes. If he refers to people who are in controlled lettings, I can assure him that their housing benefit will continue on the same basis as now. However, we cannot know in advance about those people who come within the decontrolled sector. The housing benefit that will be available for them in respect of market rents, is unknown because the rents are not yet known.Mrs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may find—it may come as a shock because he kept telling us that it could not happen and was not happening—that my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) is still talking about regulations that were implemented last April, about which there are enormous problems that are still not settled. I know that this cannot be happening because the Government said on last year's Bill that it would not happen, but, unfortunately, it is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Was the hon. Gentleman referring to transitional payments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah! He did not mention the key words. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The problem with transitional payments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or the underlying benefit entitlements. Many have not been settled. That is in addition to the problem of whether people may apply for transitional payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that I understood the hon. Gentleman until the hon. Lady intervened. Are we talking of transitional payments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we are still talking about people not knowing what housing benefit they should have been paid since last April. So they do not even know whether they are entitled to transitional payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give another pactical example. There have been major changes to the housing benefit system. It amazes me that Ministers regularly refer to the fact that everyone receives 100 per cent housing benefit when there was a change which meant that each of them had to pay 20 per cent contribution to the rates
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>685</span>
last year. That alone caused great difficulty for many people who were not necessarily pensions and who did not know how much money they would be entitled to. They simply found that their rent had increased out of all proportion to their neighbours; and they did not understand why. Therefore they went in person to find the reason. The difficulties arising from the 20 per cent contribution in the transitional rate have meant that the changes to the basic structure of housing benefit are still outstanding from last year, and we have not yet approached this year's changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that any local authority was unclear about the fact that housing benefit meant, for those who were on income support, a 100 per cent rebate on rents but an 80 per cent rebate on rates. That was clear to all authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not to the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point that the hon. Gentleman made. He said that, because of poor communications from the Department, local authorities did not understand a number of things. I do not accept that they did not understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, according to the hon. Gentlemen, there are still local authorities which have problems about knowing how much housing benefit entitlement give, owing to the reforms of last April. I do not believe that many authorities do not know, and we cannot settle the matter now. If he will give me examples, I shall be most interested to consider them. What he said is that local authorities do not know the details of and cannot calculate housing benefit, not that members of the public, who find the benefit system complicated and have to ask about it, do not know. We are talking to communications between local authorities and the Department of Social Security. I do not believe that these misunderstandings occur there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister ever visited the Scottish offices and examined the system of transitional payments? There is a backlog of between five and six months, payments. Some people have not even received a reply. Your office is a shambles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. They are not my offices. "You" refers to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right, the Government's offices. The Government sacked, or paid off, more than 100 people three or four months ago. Obviously the expected uptake did not happen. People did not know that the advertisements that were placed in newspapers were not sufficient to realise a 70 per cent uptake. The position remains. The two offices in Glasgow are to be amalgamated because there is not sufficient work for one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Transitional protection is the subject of a later clause. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman visit the transitional payment unit. He will find that it works well and efficiently. He will also find that delays and problems are a result of the slowness with which some local authorities deal with the necessary inquiries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>686</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some Scottish Members visited the transitional payment unit. In addition, I had a personal interview with the Minister's officers. We had a long talk about the problems, and, for Glasgow, there was absolute chaos. What a fraudulent system it was. The March increases were not considered in transitional payments, so people would have got nothing. Housing benefits were extremely poor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I gave way to the hon. Gentleman because he has repeated himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister visited the unit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has. He is a much better guide to the efficiency of the unit than the hon. Member for Pro-van. I shall leave the matter there because it is a subject for a later amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may be aware that in a previous incarnation I used to work in Whitehall. I can assure him that when Ministers visit institutions they do not see the way in which things work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, but they get the information about where the hold-ups are, and it is clear that when there are hold-ups, they are with local authorities, not with the unit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to the charges made by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), who talked about the losses that local authorities made when they overpaid housing benefit, and implied that the error was the Government's fault, under the new arrangements, there will be a reduced subsidy when there has been overpayment—25 per cent and 15 per cent, as she rightly said. When a local authority has recouped the overpayment, it will retain the subsidy and the amount that it has been able to claim back. The local authority need not therefore be out of pocket, and can be in pocket from the mistake, if it corrects it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Proposals to change housing benefit are discussed in the Housing Benefit Standing Committee. There are continuing discussions between the Department and local authorities, which meet every two months in this forum and in specialist working groups. In that way, the effect of proposed changes in local authorities can be established and the authorities' views taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government place great value on that consultation process because it is necessary for both sides to discharge their resposibilities effectively, and to ensure that practical problems are identified and dealt with as quickly as possible, and that solutions, when found, are found quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although proposed changes are usually discussed in draft with the local autthority associations, it may take some time to agree specific details. Most members of the Committee would agree, even if the hon. Member for Derby, South feels that she cannot, that it would be sensible to delay introducing proposals, especially those that improve the scheme for local authorities, because the final draft of the regulation was available six months before implementation date.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 153 would change the rules for housing benefit and, if the Government accepted that amendment, presumably the hon. Lady would not insist that we waited six months before implementing the change. She would no doubt consider that change to be valuable and desirable and perhaps easy to introduce—although later I shall suggest that it is, in fact, complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, it would be in no one's interest if the Government were obliged hastily to conclude discussions with local authorities on details of regulations before either side was ready, simply to meet the six months' deadline. Although I agree with the idea behind the amendment, if not with the suggestions about Government sloth, carelessness and lack of consideration—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be considerate to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and allow him to intervene if he wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I am increasingly confused because the Government do one thing in one Committee and something else in another. On 23 February this week discussions will commence on the Local Government and Housing Bill; a clause in that Bill passes over housing benefit to local authorities. As I understand it, that was not discussed by the housing benefit committee. Can the Minister confirm that and also confirm that in future local authorities will have to take the housing benefit funds from their rent accounts?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I could not confirm or deny that discussions have taken place nor, if they have taken place, could I describe them. We have regular contact and discussions with local authorities and they are valuable for both sides. But a straitjacket provision of six months would not be useful either way. I hope that the Committee will agree that the amendment would not assist the co-operation which all of us would wish to take place; indeed, it could sometimes hinder it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that because of the miscalculation in the housing support grant the Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland clearly stated that an extra £5 million was being given to Scottish local authorities? The calculations were on rents of £18.95, but the average rent in Scotland is £16.70. That means a miscalculation of £55 million. How on earth is it expected to find the extra money to pay out housing benefit? The Revenue—in terms of the rate fund or general fund contribution—has also been short-changed by £14 million. What increase is expected? It would also mean that some local authorities—including Glasgow, which is the biggest—would be 25 per cent short and would have to increase rents not by £2 but by about £4.70. That is more than a 100 per cent change. How will housing benefits be calculated out of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not an expert on local government finance in Scotland, even though I may know more
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
than the hon. Gentleman about the progress of the transitional payments unit in Glasgow. But those matters are either for the Scottish Office or the Department of the Environment; they are not directly related to the housing benefit responsibilities of this Department. The hon. Gentleman must direct his queries elsewhere. When he does sp, he will no doubt find that his suspicions of short changes are rejected and he will receive much illumination on the subject. But I cannot respond to such questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a constant source of astonishment to me that debates refer to things that have not been said, or to things in amendments which are not before us. To be precise, the Minister spent some time explaining how terrible it would be to accept the amendment because it would allow a change in housing benefit schemes unless the local authorities had been notified of that six months before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I said earlier, the second part of the amendment specifically allows a shorter time for notification, provided that it is agreed with the local authorities. Despite all the Minister's fine words about wonderfully close co-operation, I recall not so long ago the local authorities successfully taking a former Secretary of State to court on the ground that he said that he had consulted them and they said that he had not done so. I believe that the court agreed with the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are unlikely to make headway with the Government, but as the amendment does not have the rigidity that the Minister implied, there seems no harm in pressing it to a Division and I propose to advise my hon. Friends to support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment has a little more rigidity than the hon. Lady thinks. As it is worded—and I should be interested to hear her view on this—all local authorities would have to agree, rather than simply a majority, some or quite a lot. Even among—indeed, especially among—local authorities, 100 per cent agreement is not always found. The amendment is rather more rigid than the hon. Lady suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has highlighted a rigidity that had not occurred to me. However, I am encouraged by the thought that if the amendment is accepted, we can help him to modify it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is a "hospital" amendment that might commend itself to the hon. Gentleman. I shall read what amendment No. 148 says as it might help Conservative Members, if they are listening, to understand what I am trying to propose. The amendment states:

</ol></p></blockquote>
In effect, the amendment says that there are people who can decide what is reasonable other than DSS officers or even DSS Ministers. DSS Ministers may think that they are the fount of all wisdom, knowledge and reasonableness—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And generosity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are certainly not the fount of all generosity. The hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) has come to life. Conservative Members are very slow. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I did not catch that—nor, I am sure, did you, Mr. McWilliam, as it was a sedentary intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are saying that people who have a long-term stay in hospital should be better treated than they are at present. They suffer quite enough from their long-term stay in hospital, without the mean and petty removal of benefits that they normally receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote a letter from Geoff Fimister, the principal welfare rights officer at Newcastle upon Tyne, who
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
is also the adviser to the Association of Metropolitan Authorities. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If somebody is (or it looks as if they are going to be) in hospital for more than one year, then housing benefit ceases to be payable (a similar problem arises for others away from home for long periods—eg prisoners). The Local Authority Associations have asked that local authorities should have discretion to continue payment after this period, so that cases where claimants are likely to need to return to their accommodation can be picked up. We have been waiting for some time for an answer to this."</p></blockquote>
Local authorities clearly recognise what is a serious personal problem for several people and ask for discretion to use their judgment to help them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present situation is governed by regulation 5(8) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations, which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person shall be treated as occupying a dwelling as his home while he is temporarily absent therefrom for a period not exceeding 52 weeks only if—
	<ol>
	<li>he intends to return to occupy the dwelling as his home; and</li>
	<li>the part of the dwelling normally occupied by him has not been let or, as the case may be, sub-let; and</li>
	<li>the period of absence is unlikely to exceed 52 weeks or, in exceptional circumstances (for example where the person is in hospital or otherwise has no control over the length of his absence), is unlikely substantially to exceed that period."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
Although subparagraph (c) provides for cases where the absence is likely to exceed 52 weeks, even in those cases, housing benefit ceases after that period. The Housing Benefit Guidance Manual, issued to local authorities, states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"not substantially more than 52 weeks"</p></blockquote>
should be interpreted as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a total absence of up to about 15 months",</p></blockquote>
but a person who was likely to be away from home for 15 months would get housing benefit only for the first 12 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a minor but important technical amendment, which I am sure that the Minister will be more than happy to accept. I am looking at him, but I am getting no body language answer from him. Perhaps he is thinking.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendment, a person could be treated as occupying the dwelling, and therefore entitled to housing benefit, during a period of absence lasting more than 52 weeks if the local authority considered it reasonable, but the local authority would still have to be satisfied that the absence was temporary and that the person intended to resume occupation of the dwelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Discretion must be given to the people who know what is going on, and in my view, the local authority responsible for housing benefit is most likely to know. Clearly, no local authority would want housing benefit to be paid to anyone who was sub-letting his home, because that would be wrong, nor to a person who was merely having a long holiday somewhere else. That is not the purpose of the amendment; the purpose is to help people who are in hospital for that length of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, under the amendment, where the person had already been absent for 52 weeks, the period could be extended by the local authority—but, again, only if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>
the absence was still regarded as temporary. My constituency has a substantial elderly population, many of whom go into hospital for long-term treatment but then leave. If they feel that they will lose benefit while they are in hospital, they will be tempted to come out sooner than they should, because they want to keep their home, or they will become institutionalised through no fault of their own. It is psychologically important for a person in hospital, however young or old, to know that there is a loving home to go back to, and it is particularly important for a person in hospital suffering from a serious or long-term illness to know that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence and advice that have come from a number of welfare rights workers and housing benefit workers in all parts of the country strongly support the amendment. After all, they deal with the problem daily. The amendment would give local authorities a reasonable discretion to continue payment of housing benefits to people who have been away from home with good reason but who the local authorities have good reason to believe will return home. Cutting off housing benefit to such people could result in loss of home and pushing people into institutional care—people who really should not be in institutional care. I am sure that no one wants people to be in institutional care unless it is absolutely necessary, and the amendment would help to reduce the number of people in long-term institutional care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 149 would compensate for the problem of what is called the "hospital downrating" rules, in that a single person who is dependent on income support has his income support payments reduced to the "pocket money" rate of £8.25 a week after six weeks in hospital. The DSS leaflet "Going into hospital?" states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Your benefit is reduced to £8.25 plus any housing costs you can get".</p></blockquote>
But that is misleading, and the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"any housing costs you can get"</p></blockquote>
is significant. It is clear that people on income support are entitled to the maximum housing benefit, but it does not cover all their housing costs. Housing benefit does not meet housing costs. The matter was debated by the Committees considering the two previous Social Security Bills. We are debating it for the third time, and no doubt if the Government art still in office this time next year we shall be back here debating it again under another Social Security Bill. I begin to think that something is missing in January and February each year if I am not a member of a Committee considering social security legislation, and I would not want to be disappointed next winter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Merely not having one is like being thanked for not being hit over the head—the gratuitous thanks that one gets.

Everyone now has to pay 20 per cent of rates and all their water rates, any fixed fuel charges and any other charges that are not covered by housing benefit. The amounts are significant. I have here a letter from the office of Islington People's Rights at Whittington hospital, London N19, in my constituency, about the problem. It enclosed a letter that it had written to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) last October about the amount that people are having to pay because of the hospital downrating rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from the letter to illustrate my point:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is regarding the fact that everyone now has to pay 20 per cent of their rates and all of their water rates out of their Income Support. This is causing financial hardship for many people but those we are particularly concerned about are people who are in hospital for a prolonged period. If a person is single and has no dependents after six weeks in hospital their applicable amount goes down to £8.25p a week. Their Housing benefit continues for up to 52 weeks. Before the changes in April the amount a single person in this situation in hospital received was £7.90p, the money has been uprated by 35p"</p></blockquote>
—that is a fit of great generosity—
	<br><blockquote><p>"People outside hospital got an amount of £1.30p a week to compensate for having to pay towards their rates, this was inadequate but people in hospital got nothing."</p></blockquote>
The amount is inadequate outside hospital and trebly inadequate in hospital. In my borough, the average for 20 per cent of rates plus water rates is £3.95 a week. I hope that we shall not get a lecture about Islington's profligacy. It has been rate capped for most of this Government and has lost as much as any London borough in rate support grant. That is why the rates are high. Water rates are high because the Government are fattening the industry for privatisation, turning it into a so-called profitable concern to give it away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that Conservative Members do not interrupt my hon. Friend on the subject of charges in Islington, I should tell them that they are modest compared with the charges in Kensington.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing that out. High rates are often not the direct responsibility of the local authority. I shall quote further from the letter to my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury from Islington People's Rights. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The reduced amount a person recieves in hospital has always been known as 'hospital pocket money' which is exactly what it is, a minimal amount to cover the few necessities of life not provided by the hospital while you are an inpatient. It is clearly a totally insufficient amount to cover costs ouside the hospital. Most people are still having to pay gas and electricity standing charges £8.70p and £8.75p a quarter respectively."—</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
that is in London; figures elsewhere vary, but not significantly—
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a person has no other financial commitments at all they would be paying out on average £64.85p out of £106.80p that they would receive over a three month period."</p></blockquote>
Over the three months these people would have a total income of about £40.05. Commitments do not cease because someone is in hospital. People still have to pay hire purchase charges, insurance, subscriptions to organisations and so on. People in hospital buy newspapers and magazines from time to time and batteries for their radio. That was irksome when I was in hospital. I should support the Minister if he told the Secretary of State for Health to provide free radio batteries. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Was this 'he Government's intention or is it ill thought-out legislation? For people to stay in a geneal hospital for over six months is by no means rare but the problem is particularly common for people in psychiatric hospitals. If they are then discharged to their own home to come out and face debts for their rates, and possibly court summons it certainly will not help their recovery."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Government understand that the regulations, which will save only a very small amount, are petty and damaging to people in hospital. As I said when we discussed amendment No. 148, people in hospital should have the security of knowing that they can meet their commitments and that their home will be there when they leave hospital. The amendment offers a partial solution to the problem by providing that housing benefit should cover all the rates instead of only 80 per cent for people in hospital. A similar amendment will have to be tabled if the poll tax is introduced. In common with other Opposition Members I hope that it will not be introduced and so, I suspect, do most Conservative Members. Conservative Members are afraid to admit it but I shall happily give way to any hon. Gentleman who wants to say so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have accepted the principle of the need to compensate people on income support for having to pay 20 per cent of their rates or poll tax. The income support rate is supposed to include an extra £1.30 a week in compensation. From April that compensation will, in theory, be £1.30 for single people aged 25 and over and £1.15 for others. That is a fiction because the Government clawed back 50p a head of the 1988 uprating to pay for it. However, the principle has been recognised even if the Government have cheated in putting it into practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are no similar compensations for hospital patients. Pocket money has not been increased to enable patients to pay their share of the rates or poll tax. They should receive compensation or they should not have to pay. The amendment opts for the second alternative—exempting hospital patients from paying 20 per cent of rates or poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are designed to treat decently those who are ill. I do not like using financial arguments in medical, social and physical problems but petty interpretation of the rules will mean more long-term patients in hospitals and institutions. That is a waste of public money. People are better off in their own homes if they have adequate incomes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend draw the attention of Tory Members to two matters? First, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
legislation on assured tenancies means that if someone is in arrears for 13 weeks—that is not impossible in the conditions that my hon. Friend described—courts must give the landlord possession of the property. They have no discretion to do otherwise even though the person with an assured tenancy may be in hospital. Secondly, what will the Government do for people with strokes, for example, who may be in hospital for more than 52 weeks? After 52 weeks they receive no housing benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his helpful intervention. In the latter case, those people will be institutionalised, and if they are not too badly disabled they may be made homeless and destitute. There are many such tragic people in inner cities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend mentioned the new housing legislation. There has been greater mobilisation of opposition to the Housing Act than to any other legislation. In my constituency, there _:re huge meetings on council and other estates because people are frightened about the consequences of that Act. Council tenants are understandably anxious when the beady eye of a property speculator falls on their estate, but private tenants are often much more vulnerable. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said, courts will have no discretion if rent is more than 13 weeks in arrears. Housing benefit does not meet all the housing costs and the imposition of the rules in the Bill mean that some people will consistently be in arrears with rent or rates while they are in hospital. They will be judged as being more than 13 weeks in arrears and could be evicted. They will therefore have to be cared for in an institution or will have to stay in hospital for much longer than necessary, and may end up on the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a patient in Westminster hospital last year and the nursing sisters told me that they had problems discharging patients who had nowhere to go because they were homeless or had no one to care for them at home. No other institution could take them. Hospital medical beds are taken by those who no longer need medical care. That is a serious problem. The amendments will help to alleviate that suffering and I hope that the Government will accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start by removing the uncertainty from the hon. Member from Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) about the reaction that he will receive from Conservative Members. We cannot accept either of the amendments, but I agree that he has raised important points. When I have finished speaking,I hope I will leave him with a chink of light or a soupçgon of encouragement to take away from the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall comment on the background to the problem because it is serious and important although if it affects anyone—it will affect only a small number of people. At least 90 per cent of patients are released from hospital, before any of the downrating rules start to take effect. But one of the basic rules governing entitlement to housing benefit is that the claimant should be paying rent and/or rates for a dwelling that he or she occupies as a home. Occupation generally implies presence, but not always. Housing benefit regulations recognise that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0406">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
occupation can genuinely persist through a period of absence from home. But a point must come where a protracted absence calls into question the very fact of occuption even if the claimant has the idea or intention of eventually returning home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 5(8) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 places that point after 52 weeks' absence from home. After that period housing benefit, as the hon. Member for Islington, North rightly said, is no longer payable. Amendment No. 148 would allow local authorities to continue paying housing benefit to people who have been absent from home for more than 52 weeks where they consider it reasonable to do so. It is, of course, true, that wherever a line is drawn, someone will be on the wrong side of it. But having said that, 52 weeks represents a generous definition of absence from home which is incompatible with continued occupation. Local authorities can also, in exceptional cases, pay housing benefit up to the 52-week limit even when it is clear from the outset that the claimant will be absent for more than 52 weeks, as long as the limit is not substantially exceeded. This already gives local authorities some flexibility. Amendment No. 148 would allow them to extend the 52-week period without limit, wherever it appears reasonable to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it was the hon. Gentleman's intention for his amendment to allow the local authority to be the final judge in each case, but that is not a wholly acceptable approach. It would lead to uncertainty for claim ants and, inevitably, to difference in treatment between different local authorities. One of the aims of the social security reforms was to simplify the rules and enable claimants to know more clearly where they stood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to some of the points made by the hon. Gentleman about the effect of the withdrawal of housing benefit, that is not in itself a major factor in preventing long-term hospital patients from returning to the community. Local authorities have a duty to rehouse people in vulnerable groups who are homeless through no fault of their own. In some cases, it may not be practicable or desirable for the patient to return to his or her original home. Help is also available through social fund community care grants for long-term patients to re-establish themselves in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hospital downrating rules leave people with enough to pay their rates. It would take a long time to build up 13 weeks of arrears through failure to meet the 20 per cent of rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The group potentially adversely affected by the current rules is confined to single people who are absent from their homes for more than 52 weeks. Where the absentee has a partner or an adult dependant still living in the home, that other person may be able to claim housing benefit in his or her own right once the inpatient's entitlement ends, but it cannot be right for public funds to be used to subsidise empty homes indefinitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I understand the seriousness of the hon. Gentleman's point and the concern shown by other hon. Members on this topic, especially the 52-week rule in relation to hospital in-patients. I appreciate that
	<span class='label label-info column'>696</span>
there is genuine concern—the hon. Gentleman put it well—that it may affect an individual's recovery if he fears that he will not recover quickly enough to come within the 52 weeks. He may also worry after that period about how he will eventually re-establish himself. I understand that such worries and feelings could hinder the return of a patient to the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Regarding the Minister's point about not being able to subsidise homes lying empty for 52 weeks, why does the Minister allow other people to subsidise properties that are lying empty for years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If other people who are not the Government subsidise property, they are using their money and it is their concern. My point was that the Government cannot subsidise property indefinitely. The operative word is "indefinitely". That is the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reply to a written question from the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen), who raised the same point, I said that the position was kept closely under review. I am not saying that it will be closely monitored because it might draw the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) to his feet to ask whether that was on the fast track or the hard shoulder. However, we are looking at the matter carefully. And I have said that we would be interested to hear about particular cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the theoretical problem and the hon. Gentleman has expressed it very well. I would like to know about particular cases, because the new rules came in a year ago and we are reaching the point where they will become apparent, if they have not already done so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other side of the question, there is the theoretical point that homes could be left empty indefinitely for a very long time when there was no possibility of the patient being discharged or, if a patient were to be released, of his going back to his previous home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's assurances that the matter will be looked at.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not be able to make any such commitment in Committee before such cases were presented. I am giving no undertaking that we shall conclude from those cases that it would be right to change the rules. I said that it is an area for concern, that we are looking at it closely and that if there are cases—we all agree that they will be few—it would be valuable to know about them, whether they come from Kensington or from Birkenhead. The hon. Gentleman's constituents are as valuable as the constituents of my hon. Friend the Minister of State. I do not mind where those people come from; I shall be grateful to hear about relevant cases.

Amendment No. 149 would provide for a maximum rate rebate of 100 per cent rather than the present
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>697</span>
maximum 80 per cent for those not on income support, after they had been in hospital for more than six weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the important changes that we made last April was to ensure that the system for assisting claimants to meet domestic rates did not remove all awareness of the link between local authority rating and spending policies. In setting up the scheme we decided to provide for a maximum rebate of 80 per cent of general rates to ensure that everyone is aware, or is reminded, of the cost of local services. The amendment would run directly counter to that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To help those on low incomes to meet the cost of the minimum 20 per cent contribution to domestic rates, the Government included compensation for the average amount that householders on income support would have to meet in the income support and housing benefit personal allowances. Claimants who have been in hospital for more than six weeks will receive payment of all their benefits in full for this period. They will then receive a lower rate of benefit to reflect their new circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Averaged over a year, the value of income support for a single person aged over 25 would be at least £11.15 per week. Moreover, the latest estimates show that, as I said earlier, 90 per cent of all hospital patients are discharged within four weeks of admission. Only a small number ever see a reduction in benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the community charge is introduced the minimum contribution towards community charge liability will also be 20 per cent. The average minimum contribution will continue to be reflected in income support and housing benefit personal allowances. People whose sole or main residence is in hospital will be exempt from community charge liability. People who go into hospital for a short period of treatment will continue to be liable and will be entitled to receive rebates on the same basis used for housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a second chink of light, of which the hon. Member for Islington, North must make what he will. I am concerned that people on benefit in hospital who have been downrated should be able to meet necessary expenses when they receive their reduced income support. We are also looking closely at this issue. As the amendments combine these two questions, so are we examining both matters. I will not say that we are monitoring these issues but we are looking at them closely. I cannot at this stage add anything to what I said to the hon. Member for Birkenhead. However, if we conclude that people in this category require extra resources to meet their needs and liabilities, I doubt whether we would give them a 100 per cent disregard of their community charge liability. We think that the minimum contribution is a valuable rule, but we are examining how the changes affect people's ability to pay their necessary expenses and the real effect on individuals of the 52-week rule which existed before the April reforms, although not in statutory form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that with that rather lengthy explanation and our assurance that we take his argument seriously, the hon. Member for Islington, North understands why I cannot accept his amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he thought that the minimum of 20 per cent was a valuable rule. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
nonsense to give a £1.30 allowance to cover hardship. Is it to be paid every year? How much will it cost to pay it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the question relates directly to the amendment. Compensation for the 20 per cent is built into the basic income support levels. Income support was built into the scheme the first year that it came into effect, and total income support rates are increased each year in the normal way, so the allowance is part of income support payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister is being a little dishonest. There is a cooling-off period.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman needs to study this question if he does not understand it.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister should acknowledge that, although a sum that was said to be compensation was added to the underlying rates of income support, 50p was saved through inflation proofing of those rates before they were announced.

ends of the earth and beyond, but I shall pursue it at least to the ends of the earth. The matter is simple. I tabled two amendments and made it clear that the uprating was not a full uprating because 50p was taken back. The Government were giving with one hand and taking back a bit with-the other. My hon.

Income support is uprated each year according to the proper rules laid down, and that arrangement will continue while those rules remain.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Pro-van is a sensitive soul and I am a very sensitive soul. Now we have dealt with that item.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the power of local authorities. Local authorities never wanted to get involved in housing benefit in the first place. They have enough to do trying to solve housing problems without added complications. It is a bit strong for the Government to say that local authorities should not have an added power here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the greatest respect to the Minister, the Bill and the previous two social security Acts give local social security offices an enormous amount of unaccountable power. I do not understand why a local authority should not be involved in deciding whether someone should receive housing benefit beyond the 52-week period. The authority is in a much better position to judge that person's needs than is a local social security office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have daily contact with the 12 Islington council neighbourhood offices. There is a neighbourhood office with a housing manager and a housing benefit officer for every part of the constituency. I am not trying to be rude to any of the social security offices, but the neighbourhood offices are in a far better position to know about tenants than are social security officers. The Minister must understand that local authority offices are in a good position to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister then spoke about the housing problems of people when they come out from long stays in hospital. For somebody who operates in the theoretical world of Elephant and Castle or Richmond terrace, what the Minister suggested would be very nice, but the problem is that for the majority of urban area local
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
housing authorities, there is no vacant property that can be moved into straight away. The applicant has to be facing a very dire emergency indeed to get any type of local authority housing. There simply is not a pool of housing available into which people can be moved. I suspect that unless we can—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might that not be a very good reason to be careful before keeping property empty for over 52 weeks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I absolutely agree that it is a reason to be careful in the management and administration of that property. The Minister was a little quick off the mark, because my next point was that if a person stayed in hospital for, say, a year and three months, came out, wanted to return home and found that it had been given to somebody else because the local authority thought that he was not returning soon enough, he might end up in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Have we solved any problem by doing that, other than taking a person out of a flat, into hospital and then into bed-and-breakfast accommodation and putting somebody else from bed-and-breakfast accommodation into that flat? The kernel of the problem is the housing shortage, but the shortage will not be solved in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the number of empty properties around the country, but more concerned about the introduction of the poll tax which will encourage empty properties and second homes, bedcause there will be no rate charges on them. That will be a loss to the public purse and to the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that with those amendments we could expect a chink of light, but I am not sure what he means. He says, "We are not monitoring but we are looking at the situation". There is obviously a halfway house between not looking at the situation and monitoring, and that is looking at the situation without monitoring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be grateful if the Minister could be a little more specific, because as I think he will concede, we have outlined a serious problem concerning long-stay hospital patients. The number of people involved is not vast, but the problem is serious. I could provide any amount of case work through the local citizens advice bureaux and welfare rights workers, as I am sure others can, and I should be happy to do so. The Minister said that he would be happy to meet me on that, but I should be grateful if he could be a little more specific about how he is examining the situation, whether he has power to make regulations at a later stage to change it, and whether he is prepared to meet people—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—indeed, to meet me by half-past seven to discuss the matter in detail and resolve it. But is he prepared to meet the relevant local authority representatives who have put much effort into my two amendments and are genuinely concerned about the matter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked several questions and I shall try to give him as good a guide as I can about the precise meaning of "monitor", "review" and so on. The meaning usually depends on the person using the words rather than the dictionary. My hon.

Friend the Minister of State monitors; I review. That is probably much the same thing, but when I say we are reviewing, I mean that we have identified an area which we particularly wish to examine because we appreciate that there may be a problem. We have yet to be convi nced that there is a practical problem, which is one reason why I said that I would be interested in hearing about particular cases of stays of 52 weeks in hosptial and why I answered the question of the hon. Member for Nottingham, North as I did.

As for making changes, that would depend on whether they were in primary legislation or made in regulations. I suspect—I say this off the top of my head—that they will be in regulations, and therefore could be changed. No doubt a piece of paper will arrive in front of me post haste if that is not true. As we have come to no conclusion, it is impossible to say whether there will be any changes and, if there are, when.

But what I will say, as the hon. Member for Newport, West is fond of quoting him, is some words from Shakespeare. From which play they come I do not know—the hon. Gentleman will probably tell me—but we shall move with "all convenient speed", "convenient" meaning appropriate to the problem and the administrative requirements in sorting it out.

We have made some huge changes in the reforms that were introduced in April last year, most of which have worked extremely well, although I do not expect Opposition Members to agree. However, we are conscious of the need for improvement and modification to some of those changes, and we are looking at them very seriously.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That reminds me of Oliver Goldsmith's wonderful line about the circumvending route to find a way there. The Minister's use of language reminds me of the special relationship between Britain and America as two countries united by culture and divided by language. Perhaps the Minister should sort out who is saying what and who is monitoring what.

However, in the light of the Minister's willingness to monitor by the slow route, examine, re-examine or whatever, and on the basis that there will be discussions and a meeting with representatives, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>Further consideration adjourned.—	<i>[Mr. Fallon.]</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Adjourned accordingly at twenty-seven minutes past Seven o'clock till Thursday 23 February at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
