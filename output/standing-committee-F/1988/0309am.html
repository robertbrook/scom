<p>Government amendment No. 318.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government amendments give effect to promises I made at earlier sittings of the Committee. On 2 February and on 14 February, I said that regulations arising from clauses 7 and 9 should be subject, when first made, to the affirmative procedure. Opposition Members will note that we now go further by providing that the clause 10 regulations, to which the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1046</span>
same arguments apply, will also be dealt with in this way. I waste no time in commending these amendments to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our amendments suggest that other sets of regulations to be laid under the Bill should be subject to the affirmative procedure. For example, of the relevant benefits subject to recoupment under clause 18—which deals with damages awarded by the courts—only the first regulation on the subject should require an affirmative resolution. Although it is right that the first regulation should require such a precedure, subsequent regulations on the same subject of importance should also be subject to that procedure.<br><br>
In amendments Nos. 321 and 322 we are dealing with regulations that deal with the steps that a person is required to take if he is to be regarded as actively seeking employed earner's employment, and the regulations that deal with what is or is not good cause for refusing a job. As the Minister said as a result of amendments Nos. 317 and 318, when the regulations are made, they will be subject to the affirmative procedure. However, this undertaking applies only to the original regulations. We take the view that since any subsequent changes are much more likely to tighten the regulations than to make them more flexible, the affirmative procedure should be followed for then as well.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tried to respond in a positive way to Opposition Member's legitimate concerns about agreeing to have regulations arising from these important clauses debated fully the first time they come before Parliament.<br><br>
However, if we were to say that any amendment to the regulations, however minor, would for all time be subject to the affirmative procedure, it would not be welcomed by the business managers on either side of the House and would lead to a waste of parliamentary time. Of course subsequent changes will be subject to the negative procedure. Any changes in the regulations would be prayed against. That would give us an adequate safeguard for proper parliamentary discussion of these matters. It would be an abuse of parliamentary time to provide that such discussion will always be conducted under the affirmative procedures. I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Lady will agree with that, and be prepared to withdraw the amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I agree with that, but since I have little doubt that we would be defeated if we pressed the matter to a Division, I shall not divide the Committee on our amendments.</span></p>

This amendment touches on an important issue that I hope will commend itself to hon. Members on both sides. Massive changes were made in the social security system by the Social Security Act 1986, but carried into effect in April 1988. Those changes were so sweeping and covered so much of the benefit system that, in many cases, the implications have not been widely understood. For example, the Government have recently reacted to the treatment of widows. My hon. Friends the Members for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) and for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and I served on the Committee that considered that Bill and know about these matters, but they had not been drawn to the attention of general public, and came as a surprise to Ministers in the Department who were not there when the original decisions were made.<br><br>
The amendment is aimed at one of the changes that is the most invidious in its effect and the most difficult to defend. Often people become severly ill and require a level of care that qualifies them for attendance allowance. A full-time carer may then be able to receive an invalid care allowance. There is a six month waiting period, during which time the medical conditions have to be satisfied. A person has to receive substantial care before that allowance is paid. I presume that the original intention was to ensure that the allowance could not be paid simply to anyone who had a period of severe illness that was of quite short duration.<br><br>
When the changes took effect in April 1988, people who were severely ill lost some of the protection that they had previously enjoyed under the law. Although they could not receive an attendance allowance until after six months, people on low income who became severely ill and were likely to satisfy the conditions for attendance allowance could apply for, and might be awarded, an allowance under the supplementary benefit scheme during that waiting period. That completely disappeared with the new income support schemes. Moreover, if they were on a low income and had few savings, they might apply for a range of additional payments, such as for laundry bills or extra help, depending on their circumstances. They were not easily available but were available in circumstances of great need to people who were terminally ill.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1048</span>
Officers in various local DSS offices have told me that they would bend the rules to make sure that all possible support was given to low-income families if a member of the family was suffering from a serious or terminal illness. Now they simply cannot give any assistance at all, except to offer a crisis loan. We can all imagine the feelings of such people who are told that they are entitled only to a loan that will have to be repaid when they have to cope with the bereavement and the effects of a long period of caring before the death.<br><br>
Of late, we have been told that in those circumstances people can apply for a community care grant but, as with a crisis loan, a community care grant is subject to the cash-limited budget. Most local offices are grossly underspending their budgets. It is likely that money will be available. Even then, people cannot be considered for a community care grant if they have £500 in savings. That limit has not been increased from the limit that used to apply under single payments. With inflation, that limit is of less value each year.<br><br>
A couple of years ago, when the system was changed one could just about pay for the cost of a funeral with savings of £500. That is now impossible. The average cost of a funeral is well above that. When people are terminally ill, the Government are offering them a choice between being able to retain enough money to meet their funeral costs and receiving the help and support that might enable them to manage more easily during their illness.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
We have had representations from people who work in hospices and experience at close quarters the effects of this change in the benefit law, and who are very worried about those effects. It has been suggested that, apart from the community care grant, people could apply to the independent living fund. However, that fund has at least two disadvantages. First, like the social fund, it is discretionary. It is not a matter of right—people must apply to it. As it is not a large fund, there could be difficulty in meeting all the requests. Secondly, in the experience of those working in hospices, it takes a long time to deal with applications to the fund, so it is difficult to obtain financial help when it is most needed.<br><br>
The fund has said that the average delay is between eight and 12 weeks after application. It has 600 applications a month and employs only six full-time staff. Therefore, it is difficult for the fund to be a real alternative to the proper provision in the social security system that was available previously. Sometimes, the diagnosis of cancer in people and the onset of the period of severe illness is near their death. People often fail to receive attendance allowance, not because their need is insufficient, but because they do not live long enough. Considerable hardship can be caused by that provision.<br><br>
I believe that it is easier for people to understand problems if they are presented with specific examples of different cases, and that it is harder to make soothing noises about how well the principles are being observed generally if one has specific examples of the law not working well. I have an example of a lady of 45
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0601">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1049</span>
who lived with her common law husband. They applied for attendance allowance in September 1988. He provided care for her as she was bedridden, suffering from cancer of the cervix and bladder.<br><br>
At the time of referral to a home care team working from a local hospice, the lady received no benefit because she and her partner were considered to be cohabiting, and his sick pay from work was over the limit that would entitle them to any benefit as a household. Their income was only £68. Rent and rates came to £23.84 a week. Obviously, they were living in considerable poverty and difficult circumstances at the time when the lady was bedridden and close to death. Her illness had been diagnosed as late as July 1988, and she was referred to the hospice team in September, when she was completely bedridden. She died on 2 December. She was eventually awarded the attendance allowance three days after her death, but that money was not available when the need was so very great.<br><br>
Another example is of a lady in her forties with cancer of the cervix. She was married with two sons and her 17-year-old son was still living at home. Her husband lost his job because of the time that he had to take off work to take his wife to hospital for treatments, appointments and so on. The family income was £91.82 a week, from income support. They had a substantial mortgage, insurances and so on—all the commitments that people undertake when they are in work and are not expecting that to change. No one knows that his wife will suddenly be diagnosed as having cancer of the cervix. She was admitted to hospital in October 1988 for terminal care, and at that stage an application was made immediately for attendance allowance. She had not been diagnosed until January of that year, although she had had some symptoms of the disease from the previous September. She died in November 1988 and the allowance was awarded in January 1989.<br><br>
I am sure that other hon. Members have such cases in their constituencies. It is difficult to judge whether people find it more distressing and offensive to receive a letter after their partner's death that says that they cannot have attendance allowance because their partner did not live long enough or to receive one that says, "You can now have attendance allowance and here's the money" when it is too late to do any good. The money was not there when it was wanted to help to ease the burden of caring for someone. It could help to ease the inevitable worry that a dying person must feel, seeing the problems that are being caused to the family and the struggle that is being undertaken, and knowing that the remaining partner may still have a burden of debt after he or she has died, and that the attendance allowance money will not necessarily come through.<br><br>
A list of other cases has been circulated to Committee members. For example, someone of 37 was diagnosed as terminally ill in September 1988 and died in mid-January 1989. He needed care with basic daily living from the beginning of October—from within a month or less of the terminal nature of the illness being diagnosed. A woman of 61 has cancer of the ovaries with bony secondaries. Overnight, she has become almost chairbound, needs considerable extra heating, special foods and attention during the day. She is likely
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1050</span>
to die within a few months and will not live long enough to qualify for attendance allowance.<br><br>
I am aware that the Social Security Advisory Committee has recommended that the Government should take action on what is undoubtedly a serious and urgent problem. The Government delay and say, "We want to get it right, we are thinking about it, we know there's a problem and we're very sympathetic." While they are saying that, more and more people are dying in poverty that need not be theirs and cannot be justified.<br><br>
The Social Security Advisory Committee has suggested that people who have been diagnosed as being terminally ill should be exempt from the six-month waiting period. We should be happy if the Government were prepared to accept that proposal. We are inclined to suggest that rather than the provision referring to someone being terminally ill, it should be worded more along the lines of a doctor certifying that the need for an attendance allowance is likely to be permanent. I know, as I am sure the Minister knows, of cases where individuals are not told that they are terminally ill for one reason or another, as a result of their own, their family's or their doctor's decision. It may be felt that that knowledge in itself would be disastrous for them and for various reasons they could not cope. The last thing we want is for payment not to be given because people cannot be told that they are terminally ill, or if they were told that they were getting attendance allowance they would know it was because they were terminally ill.<br><br>
Therefore, the precise definition must be examined. We suggest that a doctor should certify that someone's need for that level of care is likely to be permanent. That would resolve the difficulty. It would also deal with the problem which originally led to the six-month waiting period. It was felt that the attendance allowance should be awarded not for a period of very severe illness but for a period of very short illness from which the patient was likely to recover, when the allowance would no longer be needed. That is not a problem in these cases.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will either accept the amendment or, if he thinks that it is unsuitable, introduce an appropriate amendment on Report. The Bill must provide the necessary change, or it will be another year before help is available. Even if the provision is included in the Bill, it will not be implemented until later this year. A further delay would be unacceptable. People are dying after short but severe illnesses and leaving their families with a burden of grief and considerable debt.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 6 of schedule 6 is a narrow, technical change in the legislation on attendance allow-naces. The hon. Lady has used it quite properly—I understand why—to raise the question of the six-month qualifying period for the attendance allowance under section 35 of the 1975 Act.<br><br>
I shall draw the Committee's attention to two relevant matters. In my answer to a parliamentary question on 6 February I made it clear that
<br><blockquote><p>"Attendance allowance may be paid from the date of the claim if at that date the statutory medical conditions have been satisfied
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1051</span>
throughout the previous six months." <i>[Official Report,</i> 6 February 1989; Vol. 146, c.490.]</p></blockquote>
So attendance allowances can be paid from the date of the claim if the medical advisers judge that the condition has existed for the preceding six months.<br><br>
The general rationale for the six-month qualifying period is that the allowance is designed to help with the extra costs arising from a long-term disability, not from transient spells of disability such as might afflict an otherwise fit person who is recovering from an accident. Six months was thought to be the reasonable dividing line to distinguish the transient from the long-term.<br><br>
To abolish the six-month qualifying period would cost an estimated £225 million initially, rising to an extra £325 million by the year 2000. Those are considerable sums of money. It is right that we should determine our future priorities for disability benefit in the light of the other matters arising from the report of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys.<br><br>
The hon. Lady spent most of her time talking about the most poignant aspect of the six-month delay—people suffering from a terminal illness. The Social Security Advisory Committee, in its document entitled "Benefits for disabled people: a strategy for change" published in November 1988, made no direct recommendation for the general removal—of the qualifying period, but it recommended its specific removal for terminally ill people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Social Security Advisory Committee published a report last year on the administration of attendance and mobility allowances in which it recommended that the six-month waiting period for attendance allowance should be removed. However, it was precluded from doing so by its guidelines, which stipulated that it could not make proposals that would involve extra cost.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge that point, but I am not sure that the solution favoured by the Social Security Advisory Committee and proposed by the hon. Lady is as easy as has been implied. I shall look carefully at the document that was handed to me by the hospice social workers as I arrived in Committee this morning and consider the arguments put forward.<br><br>
It is sometimes possible for a doctor to give a frank prognosis to both the patient and his family, but in some cases that is not easy. The question of entitlement to benefit could compound an already fraught and difficult situation. The hon. Lady may recall that in answer to a parliamentary question put on Monday by the hon. Member for St. Helens, North (Mr. Evans), I said that I was already giving the matter serious consideration.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
Other sources of financial help are available. The hon. Lady mentioned them in her remarks. Terminally-ill people are a priority group for community care grants and should be accorded proper priority in the system's administration although such people are not identified in quite the way that was proposed by the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1052</span>
SSAC for attendance allowance. That is also a matter to which I am giving consideration.<br><br>
The trustees of the Independent Living Fund have discretion to make payments during the attendance allowance qualifying period to people who are likely to satisfy the medical criteria and therefore to qualify for the allowance when the six-month waiting period has ended, particularly if the trustees feel that the payments will help to keep people at home.<br><br>
I note the hon. Lady's point about the delays in the Independent Living Fund's decision-making process. In the early days of the Independent Living Fund, when the trustees were taking a close personal interest in many cases so as to establish firm guidelines for the future, such delays might have been expected to occur. As the trustees will increasingly be able to give firm guidelines to staff to enable them to make decisions, the delays ought to decrease.<br><br>
I shall draw the attention of the chairman of the trustees to this debate and find out whether he thinks it right that, as independent trustees, they should give particular attention to the claims of terminally-ill people.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derby, South said that this is a matter of considerable importance. I agree with her. I have said that I am giving it careful consideration. I cannot give her an undertaking that I shall find a solution or come to a conclusion about the matter before Report. However, I give her the same assurances as I gave to the hon. Member for St. Helens, North, I recognise the difficulties and I understand the complexity, but if we are to find a solution to this difficult issue it must be right in all the circumstances. I shall continue to give the matter urgent consideration. In the light of that undertaking, the hon. Lady may wish to withdrawn the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister said was slightly encouraging. We have all had experience of dealing with the Department regarding terminal cases. I had to do that at the time of the previous social security Bill. Unfortunately, by the time that we won the case, the husband had died and there were complications. I thank the Department for at least reacting quickly and sorting it out nicely. Nevertheless, we want to avoid future complications.<br><br>
The Minister said that there were cases where payment could be made from the date of application. However, he did not tell the Committee about the criteria and the number of cases involved. It would be useful to know about the criteria so that we have some guidance when cases come to our attention, instead of wasting the Minister's time by writing to him on every occasion.<br><br>
If it has been proved that attendance allowance is necessary, I am not sure why it cannot automatically be backdated to the date of the claim, which is when the doctor and family feel that the claim is justified. I understand that there has to be a delay, otherwise money could be paid to people before it is found that they do not have a legitimate case. Once, however, the person has been proved innocent, so to speak, and is in need of help, it is moral and fair for the payment to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0603">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1053</span>
backdated to the time of the application. It would also stimulate officers and those judging such cases to speed up matters. At present they do not have to act quickly because the Government save money while the decision is being made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Some of the points that the hon. Gentleman has raised will be considered when we debate the attendance allowance and other benefits in the light of evidence from the OPCS. He asked what the criteria are for allowing the claim immediately. Those who make the medical judgment must be satisfied that on the date of the claim the person had met the qualifying criteria for the previous six months. In those circumstances, the claim can be backdated for six months. That is the present situation, but we shall be examining conditions for the attendance allowance and other matters in the light of the OPCS report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I am disappointed by the Minister's response. I had hoped that he would be able to say something more concrete about the Government's proposals and the timetable. It is inadequate, to put it mildly, to say that there are community care grants and the Independent Living Fund. The Independent Living Fund is a charitable fund set up by the Government so that they will not have to worry about people with severe disabilities not getting benefit under the package of changes. It makes decisions on a discretionary basis. People cannot claim as of right. The Government are shuffling off a responsibility that should lie fairly and squarely on them.<br><br>
The Minister said that the terminally ill are a priority group for community care grants. That is good news, but a person must be acknowledged as terminally ill to be part of that priority group. Sometimes the level of illness may not be disclosed either to the patient or to members of his family. Also, a person is not eligible for help from the social fund if he has savings that are slightly less than those needed to pay for a funeral. The Minister claims that the problem is not as easy to tackle as the Opposition imply. Frankly, the difficulties facing the Government in finding an acceptable way to help such people pale into insignificance compared to those facing people who are already experiencing pain and suffering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that emerges from what the Minister said is that a person has to prove that he is as ill when the judgment is made as he was when the claim was first made. It is an indictment of the system that the longer the delay the more difficult it is for a person to prove that he is as ill as when he first made the claim.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend has made a valid point. The Minister said that he would not be able to reply on Report. I think he said that he may be unable to do so at any stage of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>indicated assent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that that is the case. It is entirely unacceptable. The problem is urgent. Terminally-ill people die before they know for certain that the allowance will be awarded, so the financial burden is an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1054</span>
extra worry for them and their family. Some illnesses end with such severity and speed that people die before they become entitled to the allowance, but all that the Minister can say is that he does not think that the Government can do anything in this year's Bill. That is unacceptable and unjustified.<br><br>
I have another example of a woman who was diagnosed as having carcinoma of the lung when she was pregnant. Her baby is now three months old. The husband is staying at home to care for his wife and baby. The family is very short of money, but cannot yet qualify for attendance allowance. That small family is vulnerable, but the Minister simply says that it is not easy to find an answer, so nothing can be done for them.<br><br>
I have another example of a 47-year-old woman who was diagnosed in October 1987 as having carcinoma of the cervix. She lived for a year after diagnosis, but because her husband voluntarily gave up work to care for her he could not claim benefit. She could not claim sickness benefit because she had returned to Spain for two years to look after her mother-in-law and had not paid national insurance stamps during that period. Her claim for attendance allowance was finally satisfied and she also received income support. However, the attendance allowance and the retrospective income support money arrived just in time to help with her funeral expenses, not in time to assist her during the year that her husband cared for her.<br><br>
The delay implied in the Minister's reply is unacceptable. I shall return to the matter on Report and, I hope, on amendments from another place. I advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division, because it is difficult to attract attention to such matters in the House. The matter is very important and the views of the Committee on it should be recorded.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 308, in page 52, line 35, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) In subsection (2A), after "prescribed", in the first place where that word occurs, there shall be inserted the words 'or who requires parenteral nutrition other than as an in-patient in a hospital or similar institution'.".</p></blockquote>
Once again we are dealing with benefits available to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0604">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1055</span>
seriously ill people. There is a procedure known as parenteral nutrition, which is used for people who are severely ill and whose medical condition is such that they are no longer able to ingest or digest food in the ordinary way to the extent that they are able to sustain life. Some may be able to take a little food, but they have to rely on intravenous feeding.<br><br>
The qualifying conditions for an attendance allowance are that a person is so severely physically or mentally disabled that he needs frequent attention throughout the day in connection with his bodily functions or that he needs continuous supervision throughout the day in order to avoid substantial danger to himself or other persons. Alternatively, at night the person requires prolonged or repeated attention in connection with his bodily functions to avoid substantial danger to himself, or to others, another person is required to be awake for prolonged periods or frequent intervals for the purpose of watching over him.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
The lower rate of allowance is payable to someone who has satisfied either the day or the night attendance conditions. The higher rate is payable to someone who satisfies both. Under the Social Security Act 1975, which was amended by the Social Security Act 1979, a person undergoing renal dialysis at least twice a week qualifies automatically for the lower rate of the attendance allowance. Amendment No. 308 seeks similar treatment for patients undergoing parenteral nutrition at home. It is argued that the requirements for parenteral nutrition are not precisely the same as those normally required to receive the attendance allowance. However, we believe that the precedent set for renal dialysis should be followed in this case. In 1979, after a series of judgments by the Attendance Allowance Board, Parliament decided that those undergoing renal dialysis at least twice a week should be automatically assumed to satisfy the conditions necessary to receive the lower rate. Parliament decided that it was not necessary to decide on each individual case. That was not the intention of the original legislation. Parliament took the view, however, that the Attendance Allowance Board was interpreting the rule too strictly and removed from the board the burden of decision making in renal dialysis cases.<br><br>
During our discussions on last year's Social Security Bill the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) argued that all dialysis patients did not have the same attendance needs. It is because they do not all have the same attendance needs that Parliament decided to take the decision out of the hands of the Attendance Allowance Board. The relevant provisions on dialysis in the social security legislation recognise that there are certain conditions which may not require attendance of the sort that would normally qualify for the allowance but that nevertheless they require attendance at times, for the purpose of providing physical support and avoiding serious danger to the patient if things go wrong.<br><br>
I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) who underwent a short period of parenteral nutrition after a serious operation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1056</span>
a few years ago. He has taken an interest in the problems faced by people who have to undergo that procedure and has drawn the attention of the House to the issue. No one receives such treatment unless he has suffered a serious illness that has severely impaired his capacity—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was involved in an Adjournment debate on home renal dialysis patients. Can the hon. Lady say how many cases she is talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I can give the total number, but it is hundreds, not thousands. An organisation was set up in 1987 to represent the interests of those patients. It sent out a questionnaire to 44 patients, 36 of whom responded. I do not recall having been given figures when we discussed the matter last year. The debate dwelt on whether we should follow the precedent and whether the need for the attendance allowance was always met. As the hon. Gentleman will recognise from his experience with renal dialysis patients, such decisions should not be necessary.<br><br>
Illnesses such as Crohn's disease lead to major operations. People with such diseases come to rely on that treatment to sustain life. The onset of disease is often sudden—as may be the realisation of its implications. A person may be diagnosed as having a life-threatening disease, become very ill and have a major operation, all within a comparatively short period in terms of emotional impact. If he is then reprieved, in a sense, he is told that life can be sustained if he undergoes a complicated and often painful procedure for the rest of his life. Again, that is analogous to renal dialysis. When someone who was healthy shortly before realises that his whole life depends on that unpleasant procedure, it has a traumatic effect and he needs considerable support.<br><br>
May I explain the treatment to members of the Committee who are not familiar with it? A catheter must be placed in a vein above the right side of the heart. The catheter exists through the skin at the front of the chest. As with renal dialysis, the patient must be connected to small machinery such as a pump, which provides nutrition.<br><br>
A guide book is given to people who have to receive such nutrition. It advises them that they will receive supplies of nutrient mixture which must be placed in a refrigerator to prevent the growth of bacteria during storage. The feed is given only during the night. To start the infusion, a "giving set" is inserted into the nutrient mixture. Fluid is run through the tubing, which is then connected to the extension tube and attached to a pump. The pump is supposed to control the flow and alert the person by means of an alarm system, if a problem arises while he is sleeping. When the tube is disconnected, the saline solution containing heparin has to be injected through it. Heparin is a potent drug that stops blood clotting at the end of the catheter when no fluid is running through it. If it has been decided that the patient does not need an infusion every night, despite the fact that his life depends on it, the catheter must be flushed with the solution morning and evening. The patient must carry the infusion stand around and he sometimes needs help, especially if he is frail.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0605">Image</span>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has hit on a pertinent point. It depends whether the equipment is designed for use in a hospital or at home. Dialysis equipment is designed for use at home. If the infusion equipment is designed for hospital use, a patient at home needs help, particularly if something goes wrong and he is too incapacitated to take the necessary corrective action. The person would have to depend on someone being present to help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but this equipment is designed for home use. As with dialysis, people are encouraged to cope at home to maintain some independence. However, I should not want to cope on my own without help from another person, even if it were only to make encouraging noises. The procedure does cause difficulties.<br><br>
The handbook given to patients says that preventing infection is important. Infection comes either from
<br><blockquote><p>"the fluid in the bag and from the connections at either end of the giving set."</p></blockquote>
The skin around the catheter must be kept clean, and
<br><blockquote><p>"The dressing should be changed every week, or if it becomes loosened or wet. When the dressing has been removed if there are any signs of discharge or redness around the catheter or in the skin overlying the catheter tunnel, call the Nutrition Sister or Medical Registrar. The other signs of infection are feeling unwell, fever and chills. Should any of these symptoms occur, again the hospital should be contacted."</p></blockquote>
A nervous person may wonder whether he has an infection every time he feels cold or tired. Support from others is definitely needed.<br><br>
The handbook draws attention to the danger of disconnecting or displacing the catheter.
<br><blockquote><p>"It is very dangerous to allow air to enter the catheter and the catheter and tubing must be taped to prevent pulling on the connections … the extension tube is normally clamped … When the extension tube is changed once a week… it is necessary to clamp the catheter … Preventing air entering the catheter is so important that you should never be without the clamp immediately to hand."</p></blockquote>
All those procedure can be carried out at home by a reasonably healthy person without too much difficulty, according to the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security last year. Anyone can see that that is not the sort of procedure that anyone would carry out unless it was absolutely necessary.<br><br>
The handbook goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"If the catheter is clamped for an excessive period without Hepsal having been injected into it, or if the tubing kinks and you fail to awaken to the 'occlusion' alarm early enough, the catheter may become blocked by blood clotting at the end of it."</p></blockquote>
The patient is then advised of what to do if a blockage occurs. There is advice on sterile gloves, powder, and dressing packs.<br><br>
I cannot repeat too often that no one carries out that procedure at home for any length of time unless it is needed to sustain life. People have to go through that procedure week in week out.<br><br>
The handbook describes how to clean skin where an old dressing has been removed. Patients are advised to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1058</span>
remove the materials from the refrigerator 30 minutes before setting up the infusion, to wipe the working surface and spray it with spirit and put on a mask. Patients should spray themselves with spirit too, as far as I can see. They should place a sterile towel across the upper abdomen, untape the extension tube, spray around the spigot and allow it to fall onto the towel and open a second sterile towel onto the working surface. Last year the Under-Secretary described—that procedure as one that any reasonable person should be able to carry out without help and support. I hope that some people can but, as I said before, I should not fancy doing it. Anyone who has to go through such a procedure every day or every week is entitled to whatever help and support we can give them.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
Changes are underway. Last year we reported to the Committee that a new technique was being tested in Toronto, which was a self-sealing septum. It is intended to help women patients in particular because of strong resistance to the effects of surgery. The self-sealing septum means that repeated access to the catheter can be made by needle. That procedure was rejected because of the combination of pain, the build-up of scar tissue and the psychological effect of having to stab oneself in the chest whenever nutrition was needed.<br><br>
The document contains several pages of instructions for the patient undergoing treatment. They are advised about how to connect themselves to, and disconnect themselves from, the machine, what to do if the catheter is blocked or if the machines shows an alarm and how to test it. The procedure is complicated and is undertaken by people who have already suffered a serious illness.<br><br>
We have had some correspondence with parliamentary consultants who have been involved with people in such circumstances. They say that as the infusion is made
<br><blockquote><p>"via the central line venous route using equipment which has been specifically designed for hospital rather than home use"—</p></blockquote>
I misinformed my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) on that point—
<br><blockquote><p>"any malfunction of the equipment or infection can have rapid and serious consequences, needing the close presence of a carer".</p></blockquote>
If people become unable to carry out that critical treatment at home, they have to occupyu a long-term hospital bed at greater cost to the Health Service and the community. It would be not only justice but a good investment to give those people the help that they seek.<br><br>
Patients on Intravenous and Naso-gastric Nutrition Therapy carried out a survey of 44 patients, and 36 questionnaires were completed. All but two of the 36 patients had been taking this form of nutrition for more than a year. All but three spent nine hours a day or more being fed. Twenty five of them had claimed attendance allowance but only 15 had been granted it. Four were awaiting a decision and two had been awarded it but it had subsequently been withdrawn. Twenty-one did not feel able to cope with the treatment by themselves and 27 relied on other people to help them, perhaps not surprisingly.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0606">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1059</span>
I remind the Committee that in the amendment we say that this is a well-defined group like the group of people who receive renal dialysis—although it is probably smaller. Parliament should say that people in this group should not have to submit their case to the attendance allowance board. Attendance allowance is given to people who need dialysis on at least two days a week. As I said a few moments ago, 23 out of the 36 who replied to this survey have to use this form of feeding seven days a week. We feel that this is comparable with renal dialysis. That is why we tabled the amendment. Our belief that each case should not have to be submitted individually to the attendance allowance board is strengthened by some of the observations in response to the questionnaire. People who had been refused attendance allowance were asked what reasons they had been given for that refusal, both before and after their appeals. Five said that they were told that they did not fulfil the criteria laid down in the Act and that nothing applied to their particular cases. Five were given no reasons. They were simply told that the attendance allowance board had decided not to award it.<br><br>
The were all asked how much they thought the doctor assessing them knew about home parenternal nutrition. Fourteen said that the doctor assessing them knew very little about it and seven said they thought the doctor knew nothing about it. One woman who was granted attendance allowance said that she did not believe that she had been given it because of home parenteral nutrition but because she was recovering from a brain tumour and needed extra care. The doctor who awarded her the attendance allowance had no idea what parenteral nutrition was. Another person said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The doctor who assessed me knew only what I told him. His previous knowledge of HPN was nil."</p></blockquote>
Another said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The first assessing doctor knew nothing about HPN but was concerned and interested to ask all about it. The second assessing doctor knew it existed, but instead of accepting the problems he tried to elimate them by telling me how to alter my procedures … he told me to stop eating by noon which would mean not needing to get up to go to the toilet during the night! I asked him to leave as he seemed to have no intention of trying to understand my case."</p></blockquote>
Someone else said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The doctor assessing appeared to understand the problems, but he gave the impression that the attendance allowance board would not comprehend the problems of HPN."</p></blockquote>
Another person said:
<br><blockquote><p>"The local GP who came to examine me for the attendance allowance was aware of TPN but appeared not have dealt with other cases of HPN."</p></blockquote>
Last year the Under-Secretary of State implied that the aim of carrying out this procedure at home was to give a degree of independence and that as it was such a simple procedure, people could continue to work and have a normal lifestyle. People were asked about that in the questionnaire. One person said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I had to give up full-time work as a foreman motor vehicle mechanic. I do go out about two evenings a week but feel very tired the next morning."</p></blockquote>
Another said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Being on the feed disrupts my sleep, going out in the evenings and going on holiday needs a lot of planning."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1060</span>
Someone else said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I have had to resign my directorship of my company due to the fact that I am not able to work the hours necessary. I have also had significant amounts of time off work due to further illness."</p></blockquote>
Another person said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I was 'pensioned off from full-time employment unable to do anything energetic."</p></blockquote>
Another said:
<br><blockquote><p>"I had to sell my hotel and restaurant business."</p></blockquote>
Someone else said:
<br><blockquote><p>"My lifestyle has been disrupted by HPN"</p></blockquote>
and added that he could not cope with a full day's work and having to feed, and had no energy and is still weak.<br><br>
So it goes on. Many people have difficulties. Some people say that they can cope with most of their treatment themselves but that difficulties arise when they are tired or under the weather. Such difficulties arise with renal dialysis patients. However, Parliament has decided that this should not be a matter for individual decision because of the overall difficulties for people who have to sustain life by renal dialysis. I have a string of quotes from patients who have to rely on people's help with feeding and simple tasks, such as earring the pump around. One patient says:
<br><blockquote><p>"My GP whose surgery is literally across the road, has never seen me on my pump or ever seen the room I use as a treatment room."</p></blockquote>
She relies on her husband for help.<br><br>
Earlier this year a patient experienced difficulty when using the process, as it is designed to be used, while she was asleep. Her line was separated while she was infusing when asleep; there was considerable blood loss which could have been fatal, had she not had someone she could call to clamp the open line. If people are prepared to save the community substantial amounts of money by staying out of hospital and treating themselves at home, the least we can do is to offer them some help to ease the patients' and their families' lives.<br><br>
I am advised that approximately 107 people receive home parenteral nutrition. We are talking not about massive additions to the DHSS budget but about a vulnerable group of people who already suffer considerable difficulties. Parliament should exempt them from having to prove their need for attendance allowance, in the same way as Parliament exempted those on renal dialysis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady reminded us, an identical amendment was debated last year. She quoted extensively from the arguments used by my hon. Friend the then Under-Secretary. I found his arguments persuasive then, as I do now in the light of amendment No. 308. I am not saying that people receiving TPN at home should be excluded from receiving attendance allowance, but those who should receive it have to satisfy the ordinary criteria. However, the amendment seeks to allow all TPN patients automatically to receive the attendance allowance. The basis on which the attendance allowance is given, with the exception of renal dialysis, is that the qualifying criteria should apply to the need for attendance,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0607">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1061</span>
not the existence of an individual complaint or disease. We should depart from that principle only for good cause, which has not been given in this case.<br><br>
Renal dialysis is a much more hazardous procedure than TPN. It involves the removal of 250-300 millilitres of blood per minute from an arterialised vein, filtering it in the machine and returning the processed blood to the body. It is the equivalent of the whole blood volume passing through the machine several times during a dialysis period. The haemodynamic and metabolic consequences of malfunction of this process are potentially very serious. A trained attendant is therefore present throughout the process.<br><br>
By contrast, TPN involves a slow infusion, usually of about 3 litres of fluid, over 12 hours. The consequences of equipment malfunction is that the infusion stops, but the patient is in no immediate danger. All he needs to do is to take a precautionary drink of glucose whenever the alarm on the machine indicates a malfunction. He then has several hours to deal with the malfunction himself, or to seek the necessary outside advice. Before he goes home from hospital he will be advised on how to obtain that advice and help. There is a real difference between the two treatments. The amendment seeks to provide a blanket concession for those who receive TPN at home. I recognise the strength of the arguments of the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), but my arguments are even stronger.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
From what my hon. Friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) said in the Chamber on 13 January 1988 when comparing TPN with renal dialysis, the issue is not as clear as the hon. Lady would have us believe. I have shown the difference between the two treatments and reinforced the arguments that my hon. Friend made then. Before taking the action suggested by the hon. Lady, we should have to be satisfied that all TPN patients had the same attendance needs and that those needs could be accepted as sufficient to satisfy the criteria for attendance allowance without individual assessment.<br><br>
In view of the anxiety expressed last year about how the attendance needs of individual TPN patients are assessed for attendance allowance, my hon. Friend undertook to ask the attendance allowance board for a report. That report will be published soon as part of the board's annual report and, as usual, copies will be placed in the Library.<br><br>
The board is experienced in assessing the attendance needs of TPN patients and has received advice from experts in that form of treatment. Its report makes clear that the people who receive TPN treatment are not a homogeneous group. Some have suffered an acute insult which has caused the destruction of a large portion of the small intestine. Following surgical resection of the intestine, the sole remaining problem is the inability to obtain sufficient nutrients through normal digestion of food. Once established on TPN, people in this group are otherwise well. However, as the hon. Lady said, others suffer from a number of more generalised diseases—for example Crohn's disease or sclero-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1062</span>
derma—in which impaired absorption from the small intestine is part of a wider disease process. People in this group may have a wide variety of needs, some of them for attendance, in addition to those arising from intestinal failure.<br><br>
With both groups, the objective of TPN is to optimise the nutritional state of someone who cannot obtain sufficient nutrients by normal means. It enables people who have no underlying disease to lead a relatively normal life. For those who have more generalised diseases, the extent to which TPN enables them to lead a normal life will vary from person to person, depending on the underlying seriousness of the disease process.<br><br>
We are not discussing a homogeneous group. They do not all have the same disabilities and the same attendance needs. Their one common feature is that they receive TPN treatment at home. The board's finding is that they do not all have the same attendance needs. Some TPN patients can cope with the treatment and the regime it imposes on them without help from another person. Others cannot cope and need frequent attention and so are likely to satisfy the criteria for the allowance. Although I am always prepared to respond sympathetically to the changing needs of disabled people, the blanket entitlement to attendance allowance that the amendment proposes is not necessary.<br><br>
The doctors who visit attendance allowance claimants do not make the assessment. They produce a medical report for the board, which then makes the assessment. The board takes account of whether the claimant can cope unaided with the treatment and the regime it imposes, how far that is affected by the other disabilities from which the claimant may suffer, and whether any conditions of themselves generate the need for frequent attendance, continual supervision, or watching over by anyone else. The criteria and standards of judgment that the board apply to cases involving TPN treatment are no different from those applied in any other case, no matter what the cause of disablement.<br><br>
The most recent figures I have reveal that the board has considered 19 claims from people undergoing TPN at home. Of those, nine have been decided in favour and 10 disallowed. The board goes about its business seriously. I assure the Committee that in tackling the problem, the board tries tot ake into account the individual needs of the patients and whether they satisfy the normal criteria for the attendance allowance.<br><br>
I do not know which document the hon. Lady was quoting from, but I have a booklet that has been drawn up by Professor Irving of the Hope hospital in Manchester. It is a patient's handbook for those who are undergoing TPN at home and it sets out carefully the procedures that have to be followed and how to cope if anything goes wrong with the treatment. The first paragraph after the introduction states:
<br><blockquote><p>"There are now many people at home giving themselves nutrition. Both in Great Britain and many other countries. Most of those people felt the same way as you may feel now"—</p></blockquote>
presumably approaching it with some apprehension—
<br><blockquote><p>"but with help and support from the Nutrition Team you too will be able to care for yourself safely at home. Remember you will be as expert as those caring for you now".</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1063</span>
I believe that that is true in the majority of cases of people who are receiving TPN, but if there are conditions, apart from the self-administration of the treatment, that mean that a person needs looking after—perhaps because psychologically they cannot cope with doing the treatment themselves, or they have other needs—the board is well able to satisfy itself about whether the person is entitled to attendance allowance. I hope that when, in due course, the attendance allowance board has produced its report, it will be read carefully by Committee members. They will see that the board has taken a view that would lead the Committee towards rejecting the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister. I may have been doing a disservice to the Under-Secretary; looking back, it was the Minister who first replied to the debate in Committee and perhaps it was on Report that the hon. Member for Enfield, South (Mr. Portillo), the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, was also making such observations. The Minister went over much the same ground that we went over last year, but it rang even more hollow this year than it did last year. What the Minister said was extraordinary. He said that the conditions for attendance allowance are the same for everyone with the single exception of renal dialysis, which is considered to be a special case because it is a much more difficult and dangerous procedure. Therefore, the attendance allowance board, or Parliament, would have to be satisfied that all people receiving parenteral nutrition have the same attendance needs.<br><br>
That is precisely why Parliament took the judgment on renal dialysis out of the hands of the attendance allowance board. It knew that all people receiving renal dialysis do not have the same attendance needs. Let us bear it in mind that Parliament would not have done that if the attendance allowance board, in its expertise and wisdom, had not been turning down large numbers of people who were receiving renal dialysis and, no doubt, justifying it in exactly the same terms and tones as the Minister has used this morning. Therefore, parliament took the matter out of its hands because whether the board was satisfied that all those who received the allowance had the same attendance needs was not thought to be the right criterion by which to judge people who were receiving renal dialysis. I am convinced that the same judgment should be made with regard to this group.<br><br>
The Minister said that the board is expert in such matters and the people on it are the right people to make the judgment. I am glad to know that it has considered the matter and will produce a report. If we had thought that we would always agree with the board's judgment on such matters, Parliament would not have taken renal dialysis out of its hands, nor would we now propose that this matter should be taken out of its hands.<br><br>
The Minister said that the board consists of experts who have available to them the medical reports of visiting doctors and they make expert assessments on those and other grounds. Those undergoing this treatment say that few doctors know about or understand it. It is clear from the survey that none of the patients who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1064</span>
replied to the questionnaires, even those who received an attendance allowance, had much confidence in the experience or expertise of those doctors who made the medical assessment. If the board, no matter how expert it is, has to take account of medical assessments, what is its expertise worth?<br><br>
The board has little experience of this treatment, which is undergone by only a few people. The doctors who make the assessments do not have much experience of the treatment. All this talk about expertise and experience and about the board having the right people to make the judgment is just words that mean nothing in the context of this treatment.<br><br>
The Minister referred to people who are unable to cope, who need frequent attention and whose difficulties may be psychological. He said that the board in its wisdom would understand that such cases need extra help and might award them an attendance allowance. The Minister may have information that is not available to me, but I remind him of a case that we drew to his attention last year and on which we based our argument. A woman had enormous psychological difficulties in adjusting to this treatment. She was judged by her consultant, the nurses and everyone involved as being utterly incapable of carrying out the treatment on her own and needing throughout the help and support of her mother. She was turned down by the board because in theory she could carry out the treatment on her own and that was all that mattered. The law did not allow it to consider that in practice she was incapable of carrying out the treatment without attention. What the Minister said about individual difficulties being considered by the board flies in the face of all the facts unless he tells me that the board has reversed its previous decision. Were that so, my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Ross) would have told me. If even that decision has been overturned, it has come after a longtime.<br><br>
The Minister is putting the same arguments as were put last year. I am interested to learn that the board's report will be available. Why will it be in the Library and not published? Perhaps because it is such a small group, and such a small cost, that the Minister thinks that there is not enough interest to justify publication.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The board has produced a report on this subject and it will be published as part of its annual report and a copy of that will be placed in the Library.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I misunderstood the Minister and I apologise. I take the same view that Parliament took on renal dialysis. This is a matter that should be taken out of the hands of the board. The board, which has so much work to do and so many difficulties to face, should no longer have to struggle to decide whether one individual or another needs and deserves attendance allowance. I suspect that no Committee member would wish for a second to contemplate undergoing this precdure themselves, despite the Minister's treatment of it as a comparatively trivial matter to which one might easily adust as long as one was a well-balanced and reasonable person. I certainly would not wish to undertake it, nor would I wish any member of my family to do so. If they had to do so, they ought at least to be able to rely on some assistance from the

state. I shall ask my hon. Friends to support me in pressing the amendment to a Division.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Even on the hon. Lady's figures, which I have not been able to confirm, some 100 plus people are undergoing parenteral nutrition at home, and the attendance allowance board has seen only 19 claims. I should have thought that the Committee might realise that many people on TPN regard themselves as not needing this extra help, do not feel particularly disabled and feel perfectly able to cope with it.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or alternatively those people might have been told that the attendance allowance board generally takes the view that people receiving this treatment are able to cope, and that there is no point in applying for it. The Minister is advancing a theoretical argument, and I am just as entitled to theorise as he is. Many people, including those to whom we referred on the previous amendment, unfortunately do not know of the existence of attendance allowance, do not realise that they may be eligible for it, and often claim it late, which is another reason why the six month waiting period is so difficult. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said, perhaps the Department could do a little advertising, have a promotion and take-up compaign, and then assess whether large numbers of people think that they do not need this support. I suspect that those with little experience of the pension and benefit system do not realise what help is available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gather that the Government are about to launch a major television extravanganza that will inform people about their entitlement to family credit. Would it include attendance and mobility allowance too?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be a good idea if the Department generally took the view that it was its job to ensure that people received all the benefits to which they are entitled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be appropriate if the Government stopped attacking local authorities that try to advertise what welfare benefits are available? They should also stop penalising those, such as my own, that provide an excellent information and welfare rights service in every neighbourhood office and support for organisations, such as citizens advice bureaux, that promote people's rights. All that such authorities get is heaps of abuse from the Government when they try to inform people of their rights under social security legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. We have a similar problem in Derbyshire, where the local Conservative party appears to think that the council should not even advertise the services that it provides itself, and certainly should not draw them to people's attention, perhaps because people might then not wish to see them disappear. My hon. Friend is right. One most revealing development—though a minor, technical matter—was when, in the major changes in 1986, the Government repealed the duty on officers of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1066</span>
Department that had existed since the 1930s to make sure that people got all the benefits to which they were entitled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I see that my hon. Friend recalls the repeal of that provision.<br><br>
Opposition Members think that the Minister's comments were complacent and ill-informed in the sense that this is such a small group of people that even the attendance allowance board itself, which is supposed to be expert, must find it hard to get the experience that is needed. We remain of the view that the amendment should be pressed to a Division.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 328, in page 52, line 48, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(5) In subsection (5), at the end there shall be added the words 'or any modification which would prevent the payment of attendance allowance to or in respect of persons under a specified age'.".</p></blockquote>
I make no apology for bringing this issue back to the Committee. Those of us who are veterans of the last two Social Security Acts will remember the enormous efforts made in the Committee considering what became the Social Security Act 1988 by my hon. Friends he Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), for Preston (Mrs. Wise), and for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Nellist) to promote the cause for the need for attendance allowance to be payable to the parents of children under two years old who suffer from severe disability. At the time, the Minister understood, as I am sure that he understands now, the need for attendance allowance to be paid to the under-twos.<br><br>
In Samuel Beckett's marvellous play "Waiting for Godot", nothing happens for the two characters in it because they are always waiting for Godot. Every time that they are about to do something, they cannot do it because Godot is about to come. They wait patiently for a long time, but of course Godot never comes. The Minister's version of "Waiting for Godot" is waiting for Griffiths. The Minister waited and waited for the Griffiths report and eventually it came. No doubt the Minister will now say that he is awaiting the Government's response to Griffiths—which is like "Waiting for Godot" mark II—and the view of the Office of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0610">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1067</span>
Population Censuses and Surveys on the number of children under two who suffer severe disability. The problem is that for parents of those children, there was a crying need for attendance allowance when we made this proposal before and there is an equally crying need now.<br><br>
It is difficult to be exact about the number of children affected. According to the estimated figures given by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-East during the Committee debates on the 1988 Act, 13,000 children between two and four suffering severe disability were entitled to, and received, attendance allowance—at least, I hope that they received it. The estimated figure for children under two was 8,500. On report, the Minister said that the figure was something like 3,000, so there was a discrepancy. The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) was worried about that and challenged those figures. Although I hope that we can agree on the figures, that is not the point of the amendment. Parents of severely disabled children under the age of two should be entitled to attendance allowance.<br><br>
On 17 November 1987 in the Standing Committee that met in this very Room, my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South moved amendments on this subject. She said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We hope that rather than simply referring to the Moran judgment, the Minister will say a little about the way in which this section of the Bill works.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Section 35(5) of the 1975 Act gives power to make regulations to modify the effect of the previous subsections for children under the age of 16. Among other things, the power to make those regulations may also be used to make regulations which specify a minimum age of two years for the payment of attendance allowance.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The way in which the subsection is modified in the regulations leads to the end result that the night and day supervision of a child must satisfy an additional test of being supervision and being 'substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age and sex.'."</p></blockquote>
At that stage, the Committee had discussed the meaning of "substantial", and my hon. Friend went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Because of the nature of the proposed night supervision and the link between severe disability and the requirement for watchfulness, wakefulness and active supervision, it is difficult to understand how the power to modify the night supervision adds much to the test. If a child is likely to be in danger because of a disability, irrespective of whether the danger is substantial, to a degree that he requires another person to be awake at night 'for the purpose of watching over him'."—<i>[Official Report,</i> Standing Committee E, 17 November 1987; c. 45.]</p></blockquote>
The decision that a child must be over the age of two before his parents can have an attendance allowance is arbitrary. It came from earlier statements from the Government and earlier reports. In 1982, my right hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ashley) asked the then Secretary of State to
<br><blockquote><p>"extend the attendance allowance to all handicapped children in need of constant care, irrespective of their age."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 14 December 1982; Vol. 34. c. 115.]</p></blockquote>
The reply given was:
<br><blockquote><p>"Attendance allowance was introduced in 1971 with a lower age limit of two years, that being the age at which it is generally possible to identify any abnormal need for attention. When mobility allowance was introduced in 1976 the Government of the day, having
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1068</span>
regard to limited resources and the view that younger children's mobility problems are less accute, decided on a lower age limit of five years. The availability of resources and the need to determine priorities remain limiting factors on improvements in benefits."— <i>[Official Report,</i> 8 June 1982; Vol. 25, c. 74.]</p></blockquote>
Therefore two decisions have been taken in the past—first in 1976 when the lower limit was five years old and later when the lower limit was changed to two years old.<br><br>
The Pearson Commission—the Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Personal Injury—which reported in March 1978, devoted a whole chapter to the financial provision for disabled children, but unfortunately, it did not question the age of two as a starting point for attendance allowance. It merely recommended that there be a new disability allowance for severely handicapped children.<br><br>
I mention that because it is important to understand the basis of our argument. We do not say that attendance allowance is wrong for children over the age of two, because the age of two is arbitrary. A parent may give birth to a severely handicapped or disabled child, perhaps with Down's syndrome or spina bifida. Any baby under the age of two requires a lot of intention and is extremely tiring for the parents, particularly for single parents. The added difficulties of bringing up severely handicapped or disabled children under the age of two makes the case for extending attendance allowance to those parents. It would give them some support and respite from the great problems that they suffer.<br><br>
Parents suffer great trauma. It is not true that severe disabilities appear only after the age of two. Often, it is tragically obvious the moment that the child is born, or becomes apparent in the first few weeks of its life.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a good case and is one with which I have much sympathy. However, does he not accept that the problems become more acute as the child grows older? I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has constituents who have severely handicapped children over the age of 19 and that is where the problem is most difficult. I should like to see the allowance extended to cover young children who are very severely handicapped, but, in general, the problems with them are not so acute as with older children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point. He is recognised as having done much work in this area and he is correct to say that parents with handicapped children who have passed the school-leaving age are often in tragic circumstances. They have little support and are often stuck at home. As the parents get older and older, they still have the burden of a handicapped child who is dependent upon them. Clearly, those parents need extra help.<br><br>
My amendment deals with children under two years of age. It has been said that the dependency factor is not so great for those children as it is for older ones. I accept that as a child grows up, the demands and needs change. The disability changes at the same time. However, hon. Members must accept that a handicapped
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0611">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1069</span>
child under the age of two is an added burden. The child requires attention throughout the day. We propose that the attendance allowance should include such children in order to give parents additional help in looking after them.<br><br>
During our debates on last year's Social Security Bill, my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-East spoke of the problems of some of his constituents and the traumas that they suffered as a result of not being able to receive benefit until the child had reached the age of two. In the Committee of last year's Bill, my hon. Friend quoted a letter from constituents which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We are writing to you, as our M.P., asking for your help and support in trying to obtain an amendment to the law which does not allow parents of very young and chronically sick children under the age of two an attendance allowance. The present attitude by the authorities is that these children require no more care than a normal healthy child, we know ourselves from close family experience how wrong they are. For many parents this situation is a desperate one.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Our daughter has 18 month old twins who are both severely mentally and physically handicapped, and until very recently the only qualified relief she received was a two hour respite once a week from a voluntary organisation who sent in a trained nurse, very necessary as one baby suffers frquent Apnoea attacks and needs someone capable of resuscitation. An attendance allowance would have been a great help enabling her to pay for a trained nurse to relieve her more often.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>It has been a shattering experience for our daughter and her husband leaving them both mentally and physically exhausted.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The cost to the Authorities involved, if the babies had been left in their care, would have been enormous, but it does appear that parents who take on all the responsibilities for such children are not being given the help they deserve.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Even visits to the hospitals are often, as you well imagine, made very difficult by not being able to get a parking space that is convenient. Our daughter has to carry the two babies, neither of which is capable of sitting up unaided, plus a portable oxygen cylinder, and a suction machine quite a distance."—<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 17 November 1987; c.51.]</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members should put themselves in the position of those who have a baby needing constant medical supervision. They may say that those babies should be in hospital or in permanent care. However, is it a good idea to put children into permanent care when a better environment would be provided at home with the necessary support? The received wisdom of the social services is that it is better for children to be brought up in a home and family environment rather than in an institution. There is no quarrel about that, but some parents need additional help to look after their children at home.<br><br>
The parents referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-East managed to get help from a local voluntary organisation and all credit to that organisation for providing that nursing facility. Had it not done so, those babies would have been in institutional care or in hospital at a greater cost to the community and the public purse that the cost of an attendance allowance for assistance at home. That is not an uncommon problem.<br><br>
I referred to the numbers involved and the potential cost. When the Standing Committee considered the Social Security Act 1988, the cost of extending the limit of £30 a week would have been about £30 million. That sum would be greater now but even if it were substantially higher, it would still be a small sum to pay for an enormous benefit to the parents of children under the age of two. If another analysis of the costings were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1070</span>
carried out, it would show an increased cost for attendance allowances—that could be borne by the public purse because it is proper public expenditure—and a reduction of costs for hospital care. That important point should be borne in mind, although finance should not be the only consideration.<br><br>
When the 1988 Act was reported, the Minister said that he understood our points and that those families needed help, but he was not convinced that the allowances should be extended to parents of children under two years old. He said that he would await the outcome of the Griffiths report on community care and the report of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. I hope that the Minister has had time to reflect on this matter and will now conclude that this allowance should be extended. In the Standing Committee considering the Social Security Act 1988, he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Many cases under the age of two are difficult to assess, and it is even harder to make assessments under the age of 18 months. I do not dispute the fact that some children can be identified and assessed even younger, but I hope to persuade the Committee that the age of two is a logical point at which to start to pay attendance allowance."—<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee E,</i> 17 November 1987, c.64]</p></blockquote>
The Minister may have won the vote in Committee—I did not expect anything, else from the Trappists on the Conservative Benches—but he did not persuade me and others outside the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mrs. Wise) received volumes of correspondence strongly supporting the view that the attendance allowance should be extended to those caring for children under the age of two. Severely handicapped and disabled children need help and support, but their parents may suffer considerable trauma and shock, especially if they had no warning.<br><br>
They find that the handicapped child needs their total attention.<br><br>
As normal children get older, they require less attention because they can entertain and educate themselves if left alone for short periods, but that is not possible with severely handicapped or disabled children.<br><br>
Families with a handicapped child are put under a strain because they can never go out and leave that child with another person. A normal child can be left with grandparents, neighbours or friends, but it is not so easy with severely handicapped babies. I see no reason why the attendance allowance should not be extended to the parents of children under two.<br><br>
Mencap, which has done a great deal of work in this area, sent this message to my hon. Friend the Member for Preston:
<br><blockquote><p>"Finding out that your baby is severely and profoundly handicapped adds enormous stress. One mother describes how she reacted to the birth of her profoundly and multiple handicapped daughter.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"When the baby was about 3 weeks old, she began to have fluttering eyes and jerking limbs. The GP dismissed me as a neurotic mum, and told me not to worry. I saw another doctor who arranged a hospital appointment. It ws then that I found out the "flutterings" were in fact convulsions. Worse still, there was brain damage. That was the beginning of the nightmare … I faced life minute by minute, thinking to myself "if only I can get through this day".</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>We were all affected. My husband was cold and withdrawn. And my other daughter—she had wanted a sister but this wasn't like other people's sisters. This one screamed for 12-14 hours a day'."</p></blockquote>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1071</span>
Meneap comments:
<br><blockquote><p>"The effect on siblings can be shattering. The mother above said that her other daughter never knew if 'mum' would be there in the morning, or if she'd be back at the hospital with the baby."</p></blockquote>
Such is the tension and pressure<br><br>
The case is unanswerable. The money involved is small compared with the help that it would give to the parents of handicapped children. It would be a measure of the caring attitude of society and its institutions if the Government were prepared to recognise that parents of severely handicapped children under the age of two should not be ignored, as they are by the existing legislation which draws this arbitrary line. When severe handicap or disability becomes obvious and identifiable by local social services and medical practitioners, parents should be entitled to an attendance allowance. They should not have to wait until the child is two. Society owes those parents nothing less than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We spent ten and half hours on this matter when the last Social Security Bill was discussed and we had another full discussion on Report. I do not complain about the hon. Gentleman returning to this extremely sensitive issue. Anyone with experience of severely handicapped children knows that they place an appalling strain on parents. No member of the Committee disputes that.<br><br>
I shall explain the Government's attitude in a moment, but first it is worth pointing out why the age of two was chosen initially. The hon. Gentleman identified the first reason: that children up to the age of two received a high level of care in any case and that there was not a significant difference between the care that a handicapped and a normal healthy child need at that age. Secondly, paediatricians felt that two was the age when small hitherto imperceptible differences in behaviour and attitude coalesce into markedly and possibly major disparities between the development of disabled and non-disabled children. It was felt that two was the age when such a judgment could be made about the extent of a child's disability. That was the original rationale, but in our discussions last year we all recognised that those arguments had been overtaken by events. Advances in medical and nursing care mean that more children with severe congenital abnormalities, birth trauma and other disabilities now survive, whereas they would not have survived only a few years ago. That has altered the background against which we consider such cases.<br><br>
We acknowledge that it is possible to identify children under the age of two who need care that is substantially in excess of that needed by normal, healthy infants. Having taken advice from an eminent paediatrician, I recognised last year that the age of two was no longer a tenable proposition.<br><br>
12.30 pm<br><br>
In my final remarks on Third Reading on 12 January I said that I hoped that the House would reject the amendment against the background of a recognition that support for the families of disabled children throughout the age range would be inescapably part of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1072</span>
the system. I do not ask the Committee to wait for Godot but just to wait a little longer. We should examine the needs of disabled children and of those who care for them in the light of the OPCS reports, which will be published in a few months. We shall reconsider the future of disability benefits, so I ask the Committee to have a little more patience. We are considering the attendance allowance and the fact that the granting of that allowance is in many cases a passport to the invalid care allowance. The cost will be about £10 million. I shall examine sympathetically the case that the hon. Member for Islington, North made so eloquently last year and again this year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that he asked us to be patient for a little longer and to wait for the OPCS report and survey. Patience is a virtue from which I do not suffer and I make no apology for that. We may bandy figures about, but there are fewer than 10,000 parents—perhaps as few as 3,000 or as many as 8,500—of such children under the age of two. Those parents have not waited patiently. They have suffered on their own. It is unreasonable for the Minister to give an estimate of £10 million.—<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle)—always a wag—says that that is chicken feed. I hope that he is not referring to the cost of my chicken feed.<br><br>
When the egg producers were found out, £17 million was found in three days for them to slaughter their flocks because of supposed salmonella contamination. I shall not pursue that point because you would rule me out of order, Mr. Winterton. However, there is something wrong with the Government's reactions if the farming community receives £17 million after three days of newspaper pressure but the parents of severely handicapped children under two are old to wait a little longer.<br><br>
I do not know when that waiting will end or why they have to wait. If the Department's estimate is £10 million, the Government should accept amendment No. 328. Nobody disputes that there is a problem or denies the feeling of helplessness and hopelessness that is experienced by those parents. Why, therefore, do the Government not accept the amendment so that the allowance can be paid to those who can be quickly identified?<br><br>
I am not sure why we have to wait for the OPCS report. Earlier I mentioned "Waiting for Godot" but that splendid fellow never revealed himself. The Griffiths report said that community care would cost money, but the Government have not responded. Now the Minister says, as he said on Report during the passage of the Social Security Bill 1988, that we should wait for the OPCS report.<br><br>
The OPCS survey and summary may say that a certain number of children can be identified, but it is not the job of the OPCS to define what the social security legislation should be. The job of the OPCS is to keep records and provide information and definitions. The Griffiths report, the Department of Social Security and this Committee share the job of deciding on social security legislation.<br><br>
I am glad that no one disputes the case that I have put
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0613">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1073</span>
forward this morning. Others outside the Committee will find it strange if the Committee unanimously recognised the traumas faced by parents of handicapped children under two and believes that children with special needs can clearly be defined, but does not provide them with allowances. Needs change throughout life. The social security legislation should recognise that fact.<br><br>
Some close friends of mine have just given birth to a severely handicapped baby and I know the trauma that they have undergone. No amount of caring words can change the fact that their baby is severely handicapped. My friends are not financially hard up and will manage, but many others, such as the unemployed and single parents, will not. They hope that social security will help them out. It is the function of social security legislation to recognise the special needs of certain handicapped children and to support their parents.<br><br>
If the Minister wishes to use financial arguments to get the measures past those stone-faced people in the Treasury, he ought to reconsider his arguments. I shall not be offended if he quotes mine. He can produce the information that shows that the costs of keeping children in regular medical care is 10 times greater than the cost of the attendance allowance that provides help and respite at home. There is the added difficulty of parents feeling inadequate when separated from their children.<br><br>
I ask the Minister please to think again. Everyone agrees that there is a problem and that a solution must be found. One solution would be to extend attendance allowances to parents of children under the age of two. I see no reason why the Committee cannot do something useful and pass the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is trying to hold the line that the Department has consistently pursued, that everything has to wait for the OPCS report. However, everything has not waited for that report. The OPCS was asked to carry out a review of the problems of disability in 1984 when the Fowler review first began. We were told then that it might take a year. Then we were told that it might take a couple of years and now the report has begun to appear. But things have not stood still while we have been waiting for the review. Under the Social Security Act 1986, the most severely disabled were the biggest individual losers. Changes have been made in the payment of benefits under the industrial disabilities scheme. The reduced earnings allowance has been frozen at retirement. It has been cut by 25 per cent—at a cost of nearly £20 to the people entitled to it.<br><br>
The Department has continued to cut benefits to the disabled while it waited for the OPCS review. There have been no corresponding improvements. The only improvement that I can bring to mind is the one in the Bill that means that, at least, the mobility allowance will not be taken away from people who are already in receipt of it.<br><br>
The amendment deals with a comparatively small number of people, but it is a unique case. At last the Minister is not saying, "Yes, we know that there is a problem. We understand and are very sympathetic,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1074</span>
but we are not sure whether this is the right way to tackle it. We are not sure that the problem can be properly identified; we are not sure that it is an area where we should be making extensions." The Minister has said, "Yes, we agree. You have made the case. We cannot contest it and we do not dispute the fact that the benefit is needed. Something will be done, but not yet. Please wait for the OPCS review." The Minister has asked us to be patient, but I am reminded of the lines in "Twelfth Night"
<br><blockquote><p>"She sat like patience on a monument.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Smiling at grief."</p></blockquote>
The Minister is not smiling at grief, but he is not doing anything about it, either.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate my plea to members of the Committee to allow me to look at the needs of disabled children of all ages in the round. At the same time I shall look at the needs of disabled people as a whole.<br><br>
In practice, it is not open to me to make a move on this case because it may interract with other aspects of provision for disabled children. I ask the Committee for patience, but I undertake to consider the powerful and compelling case that has been made by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister. We are agreed on the merits of the case, but will he tell us when he expects to make the full review and when he expects the OPCS report to be published? Is there any reason why the Committee could not now agree the amendment to extend attendance allowances? It would not, I understand, prejudice any later review that might take place. 1 am glad that there will be a review of the needs of disabled people of all ages and I hope that it will lead to increased help for them. However, I do not see why the Government cannot accept the amendment and then move on to other areas of need, such as those identified by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The timing is well know. All six OPCS reports will be ready by July of this year. There will have to be time for representations to the Government from the organisations speaking for the disabled. No doubt the disabled will have strong views about the way ahead. I shall want to consider them as urgently as possible and see what action has to be taken. I do not want any delay. I want to get on with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister wants to get on with it. So do we. For that reason we shall divide the Committee to show the parents of handicapped children under two years of age the views of Committee members on the need for urgent action now. I hope that when the reports appear in July, it will lead to more help for disabled people of all ages.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 187, in page 53, line 18, leave out from "relative)" to end of line 21 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"for paragraph (a) of subsection (1) there shall be substituted—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) for any period during which either—
<ol>
<li>the pensioner and her husband are residing together and he does not have earnings at a weekly rate in excess of the amount specified in paragraph 1(a) of Part I of Schedule 4; or</li>
<li>they are not residing together, he does not have earnings at a weekly rate in excess of the amount specified in Schedule 4, Part IV, column (3) and she is contributing to his maintenance at a weekly rate not less than the amount so specified.'.".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
The amendment corrects a defect in the wording of paragraph 8(1) of schedule 6. When read with the opening words of section 47 of the Social Security Act 1975, the paragraph has the unintended effect of setting the earnings limit for a resident husband of an invalidity pensioner at the level of the dependency increase—currently £24.75 per week. The more generous limit of £32.75, linked to the rate of unemployment benefit, applies to a resident dependant and the amendment would ensure that it continues to do so.<br><br>
In drafting the amendment, the opportunity has been taken to make the layout of paragraph 8(1) clearer. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 136, in page 57, line 17, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"17A. In paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, after the words 'Social Security Act' there shall be inserted the words 'or who provides such evidence in support of a claim for income support.'."</p></blockquote>
This is in a sense a probing amendment, although the Government may be able to accept it. Paragraph 5 of schedule 1 to the Income Support (General) Regulations provides an exemption from the requirement to be available for work for people who are incapable of work because of sickness or disablement. The paragraph has been amended with effect from April and refers to the person who provides evidence of incapacity in support of a claim for sickness benefit, invalidity pension, severe disablement allowance, and so on.<br><br>
Does that paragraph still apply to someone who is not entitled to any of the benefits listed, but who provides evidence of incapacity in support of a claim for income support? We assume that that is the intention.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1076</span>
but it is not clear from the wording of the paragraph. Amendment No. 136 has been tabled to remove any doubt on the subject.<br><br>
A similar question arises in connection with entitlement to the disability premium under paragraph 12. A person can qualify for that premium if, for 28 weeks, he or she has been treated as incapable of work for the purposes of one or more of the provisions of the Social Security Act 1975. Can people who are not entitled to any benefits under the 1975 Act still qualify for the premium? A reply to a parliamentary question some time ago appeared to confirm that they can, provided that they produce evidence of incapacity for the relevant period. Again, that is not clear from the wording of the regulations, and a good deal of confusion has resulted.<br><br>
There seem also to be some administrative complications. In the interests of computerisation, claimants who are not capable of work but who do not receive national insurance benefit have to give sickness certificates to the sickness benefit section of the national insurance office. The adjudication officer decides whether they are incapable of work, and if so, notifies the adjudication officer in the income support section.<br><br>
That seems to be unnecessarily complicated and confusing. Many claimants know that they have no entitlement to national insurance benefit, and proof of incapacity is the same, whether it is proved in the context of sickness benefit or of income support. Any adjudication officer is capable of making that judgment. Adjudication officers in the means-tested sections have had to make decisions of that kind for many years in the context of supplementary benefit.<br><br>
This is an area of confusion that could easily be clarified. I hope that even if the amendment's wording does not commend itself, at least the points raised there will commend themselves to the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes to each of the hon. Lady's questions. I shall look at the administrative point that she raised with some care. When a claimant makes a claim for incapacity benefit which is supported by medical or other appropriate evidence, the case is considered by adjudication officers who are trained in and familiar with the benefit's requirements. If a claimant fails to qualify for those benefits, other than on grounds of medical evidence, he can turn to income support for help. If his medical evidence is accepted, even though it has not led to qualification for the incapacity benefit, it would be accepted by the income support adjudication officer. That avoids the need for the income support scheme to be burdened with rules and regulations on incapacity and enables it to remain as simple and straightforward as possible to give help as a matter or last resort.<br><br>
If we were to accept this probing amendment, claimants might go to income support first, instead of to the rather more generous incapacity benefit, which the hon. Lady would not wish. I hope that, in the light of these assurances, she will not press the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has clarified matters to some extent. We understand that the outlined pro-

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1077</span>
cedure is simpler for the Department but it is not necessarily so for claimants, especially those who know that they will not receive a national insurance benefit and who wish to go to the office that is the right one for them. I am glad that the Minister is prepared to consider that and that he has placed it on record that the entitlement to income support remains untouched. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 139, in page 57, line 17, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"17A. In paragraph 12(l)(c)(i) of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, after the words "on account of, there shall be inserted the words 'retirement or',"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 329, in page 57, line 17, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"17A.(1) In paragraph 10(l)(b)(i) of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, for the words 'or (c)' there shall be substituted the words', (c) or (d)'.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) In paragraph 12(1) of that Schedule, after sub-paragraph (c) there shall be inserted "or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(d) the claimant or. as the case may be. his partner would satisfy the conditions of entitlement to mobility allowance if he were under the age of 65.'.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 330, in page 57, line 17, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"17A.(1) In paragraph 10(l)(b)(i) of Schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987, for the words 'or (c)' there shall be substituted the words', (c) or (d)'.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) In paragraph 12(1) of that Schedule, after sub-paragraph (c) there shall be inserted "or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(d) the claimant or, as the case may be, his partner would satisfy the conditions of entitlement to invalidity pension or severe disablement allowance if he were under the age of 60.'.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 12 of the schedule to the income support regulations sets out the conditions that a person aged between 60 and 80 must satisfy to qualify for the higher pensioner premium—£2.50 for a single person and £2.45 for a couple from April 1989: I am sure that that last figure cannot be right. The main conditions are that a person has to be in receipt of attendance or mobility allowance, or of invalidity of severe disablement allowance. They must be already entitled to a disability premium before reaching 60, and have been on income support since then. Alternatively that person must have been receiving invalidity benefit, but ceased to do so on reaching the age of 65 for a woman or 70 for a man. That is the maximum age for entitlement to invalidity benefit.<br><br>
The higher pensioner premium is paid at the same rate as the disability premium and, in effect, replaces it for disabled people aged between 60 to 79. As matters stand at present, some people who clearly should qualify are being left out. That is what these amendments relate to.<br><br>
Amendment No. 139 deals with a fairly narrow point. While someone who continues to claim invalidity benefit up to the maximum age can then go on to the higher pensioner premium when that benefit ceases, a person who just before reaching that age decided to retire and claim retirement pension instead of invalidity benefit would not have an entitlement to the premium. That may be an accidental decision that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1078</span>
the individual makes. Not everyone realises that it is possible to go on claiming invalidity pension instead of a retirement pension. There is no financial difference except that one is taxable, but that may not be a consideration for all claimants. Someone may make that decision in error and find that when he reaches the maximum age he cannot get the higher pensioner premium.<br><br>
This anomaly is impossible to explain to those who have been affected by it. They do not accept that it is a just or correct decision. We wonder whether there was a mistake in drafting the regulations. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South and Finsbury (Mr. Smith) wrote to the Secretary of State about it last July and got a reply from the Under-Secretary of State saying that it was impracticable to award the higher pensioner premium on the basis of a hypothetical prior entitlement to the disability premium. That was not what my hon. Friend suggested and it is not what we are suggesting now. We hope that the Government will agree to look at this because an accidental disbarring might have occurred.<br><br>
Amendment No. 329 would give entitlement to the higher pensioner premium to someone who would be entitled to mobility allowance if he had satisfied the condition of being unable to walk before reaching the age of 65. The Government's reason for refusing to pay mobility allowance in such cases when the allowance was introduced was one of cost. It was hoped that the resources would eventually become available. The mobility allowance was also intended to help people maintain the link with the labour market. It is one thing not to pay mobility allowance, but it is quite different to refuse to pay the same rate of income support to someone who becomes disabled at 66 as to someone who became disabled at 64. The condition would be the same as for mobility allowance, but the link with the labour market would not be relevant. It would depend on the person's circumstances and needs.<br><br>
Amendment No. 330 would extend entitlement to people who become incapable of work through sickness or disability after reaching pension age. Again, their needs are no less than people whose incapacity commences before pension age and they should receive the same rate of income support.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The effect of amendments Nos. 329 and 330 is to introduce two new routes to the income support higher pensioner premium. I listened carefully to the arguments put forward by the hon. Lady, but this is another occasion when I must use the imminent arrival of the OPCS survey as an excuse. When we look at those surveys we must decide the way in which we consider the two groups of people: those who suffer disability with the inevitable onset of old age and those who suffer disability during their working lives and whose ability to provide for themselves and their families in their old age is affected by their disability. That will be an important aspect of our consideration of those surveys. We need to have a coherent approach to disability benefits, and I hope that rather than trying to bolt on these piecemeal additions we could look at the whole thing in the round.<br><br>
Amendment No. 139 is defective as its purpose is to amend a paragraph which does not exist. However, it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0616">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1079</span>
appears to be intended to amend paragraph 12(1)(c)(i) of schedule 2 to the Income Support (General) Regulations which lays down conditions for treating a person as though he were receiving a qualifying benefit for the income support higher pensioner premium, even though entitlement to that benefit has ceased. Unlike amendments Nos. 329 and 330, this amendment bases entitlement to the higher pensioner premium on a clear and objective criterion: entitlement to a qualifying benefit at the point of retirement. That is in line with our intention to base the premium structure on readily ascertainable facts. We have already made provision for that in the poorer pensioner package which will come into effect in October. This amendment is unnecessary as the point has already been met. I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1080</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I had not realised that the point we made on amendment No. 139 would be covered and I am glad about that. I wonder what on earth the Department will find to say when the OPCS reviews are finally published to defend itself against claims for higher benefit. Perhaps neither the Minister nor I will have to worry about that by then. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
