	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I wish to raise a point of order about the supply of copies of the report of the regional organisation scrutiny of the DSS entitled "The Business of Service". It was the subject of much debate this morning, when we sorely missed you, Mr. McWilliam; I am sure that you would have enjoyed it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the report was printed last year, that it is now out of print and that copies are unavailable to the general public. It is a matter of concern to employees of the Department and to users that they cannot obtain copies. I wonder whether it is possible through you, Mr. McWilliam, to persuade the Minister to arrange for a re-print so that the publication is readily available or, alternatively, to ask the Ayatollah to condemn it, in which case it will become a best seller.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me. But if the Minister wishes to respond, I have no doubt that he will be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that there has been a run on that book because it is well worth reading. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman managed to obtain a copy to read and I hope that he will read it again. I shall certainly take up his point about trying to arrange for a supply of additional copies for the public and for Members of the House. The more it is read, the better it is understood and the happier we shall be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his reply. We might all be better informed but I am not sure whether we shall be happier for that. Nevertheless, we should like to have copies to read.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='schedule'>Schedule 1</div> <!-- schedule -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>ADJUDICATION</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day],</i> No. 220, in page 21, line 44, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2A) Regulations may prescribe cases in which a Commissioner shall not exercise the power conferred by subsection (1) above.".—	<i>[Mr. Peter Lloyd.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was about to say before I was interrupted at One o'clock, the part of the schedule to which the amendment refers is a new arrangement. It levels up the present provisions so that the adjudicating authorities will have slightly greater powers and flexibility. The amendment would reinstate the regulation-making power which would otherwise be lost and
	<span class='label label-info column'>830</span>
which, as now, would be used to restrict the social security commissioners access to expert medical reports or results of examinations in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are currently set out in the Lord Chancellor's procedure regulations for the commissioners. They prevent the commissioners from obtaining expert medical reports or results of examinations when dealing with applications for leave to appeal, or appeals, from medical appeal tribunals or the attendance allowance board, which are experts in their own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing general power is being repealed, but this specific provision is stil necessary. Appeals to the commissioners can be made only on points of law and commissioners are not empowered to change medical decisions. That is why they should not have available to them such medical reports or results of examinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would retain the rules as they now are and no change in practice is intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Government amendment No. 221, in page 23, leave out lines 4 to 6 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(a) if the adjudication officer considers that the decision which he has made on the review is the same as the decision that would have been made on the appeal had every ground of the claimant's appeal succeeded, then the appeal shall lapse; but".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take amendment No. 177, in page 23, line 6, after "lapse;", insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) if the decision is such that the period for which the claimant is or would be disqualified for unemployment benefit is reduced, the decision shall take effect but the appeal shall proceed unless withdrawn and the appeal tribunal shall not have the power to increase the period of disqualification;".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Paragraph 7 of the schedule and amendment No. 221 give statutory backing to a procedure endorsed by the social security commissioners whereby an appeal to a social security appeal tribunal against an adjudication officer's decision lapses if the adjudication officer can give the claimant all that he could have got, had his appeal succeeded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure not only benefits the claimant by giving him a favourable decision quickly and without the need to wait for a tribunal hearing to be arranged, but it is also administratively quicker and cheaper for the adjudication officer to review his decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that it may be a subjective judgment for the adjudication officer to decide what the claimant would have been awarded by the tribunal, but this is not currently a problem in practice. When the adjudication officer is unsure, he simply does not revise the case but allows the appeal to proceed in the normal way. As a further safeguard, the claimant's appeal rights are unaffected. He can appeal against both the adjudication officer's original decision and his revised decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government amendment makes it clear that the appeal lapses only when all the material grounds of the appeal are satisfied by the adjudication officer's revised decision. I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0482">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
Amendment No. 177 would require that, when an adjudication officer has favourably reviewed an appealed decision reducing the period for which a claimant has been disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit, his review decision would take effect, but the appeal would still proceed to the appeal tribunal. However, the tribunal would not then be able to increase the period of disqualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment restricts the powers of the social security appeal tribunals, but appears to forget the Social Security Commissions, to whom the adjudication officer could appeal, on a point of law, if he disagreed with the tribunal's decision. Moreover, it presents technical problems as it allows the adjudication officer's review decision to take effect, thus cancelling or replacing the original decision, but still allows the appeal against that original decision to go forward to the tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary. Our proposal in paragraph 7 of schedule 1 is that appeals to appeal tribunals should lapse when the adjudication officer has reviewed his original decision, but only when he can do so entirely favourably to the claimant. As hon. Members will know, we are clarifying paragraph 7 with a Government amendment. But our intention is that, unless the adjudication officer can give the claimant all that he could have got on appeal, his review decision will be of no effect and the appeal will proceed to the tribunal in the normal way. In cases of disqualification for unemployment benefit, the adjudication officer would effectively be prevented from reviewing his original decision unless he decided not to disqualify at all. Any residual period of disqualification would simply not constitute a decision favourable to the claimant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of that, I hope that the Opposition will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's explanation, we shall not press amendment No. 177.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Government amendment No. 222, in page 23, line 19, leave out "a claimant" and insert "the claimant in question".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 223.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Social security legislation sets out who can appeal to a social security commissioner against a decision of a social security appeal tribunal or a medical appeal tribunal. However, the relevant legislation relating to appeals to the commissioner from decisions of the attendance allowance board delegates this power of specifying who can appeal to the Commissioners to regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is desirable that rights of appeal should be set out in primary legislation. In keeping with other social security appeal legislation, we think that the Social Security Act 1975 should state who can appeal to the commissioners against the decisions of the attendance allowance board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>
The Government amendment simply makes it clear that it is the claimant in question, not any claimant, who has the right of appeal. No change in practice is intended. As now, the claimant in question and the Secretary of State will both have the right to appeal to the commissioners. I hope that the Committee will accept this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer now to amendment No. 223. Paragraph 8 of the schedule and our Government amendment tidy up existing legislation so that when on an appeal to him, a commissioner decides that a decision of the attendance allowance board is erroneous in law, he shall set it aside and refer the case back to the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On such a reference, the board will not be able to refer the remitted appeal to the delegated medical practitioner who gave the erroneous decision, unless exceptionally the commissioner directs otherwise. It is only natural justice that a delegated medical practitioner or practitioners whose decision has been found to be wrong in law should not determine the case, but leave the decision-making to another delegated medical practioner or practitioners. The commissioner may, or rare occasions, consider that the original delegated medical practioner is the best placed person to determine the remitted appeal, and amendment No. 223 ensures that he will have the power to so direct. I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 223, in page 23, line 23, leave out
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Board shall not delegate its determination"</p></blockquote>
and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless the Commissioner otherwise directs, the Board shall not delegate the determination of that case".—	<i>[Mr. Peter Lloyd.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Government amendment No. 224, in page 24, line 9, leave out 'from' and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the day prescribed for that purpose by reference to".</p></blockquote>
Under section 104 of the Social Security Act 1975 adjudication officers may review their decisions at any time, on a number of different grounds, including where there have been changes in the claimant's circumstances. Many changes of circumstances are readily foreseeable—for example, age changes, regular hospital admissions and changes in income—so claimants can notify the relevant change in good time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Current practice is for the adjudication officer to take these changes into account when examining a case, so that the claimant receives the correct amount of benefit at the time of the change. Paragraph 11 of the schedule now reflects this operational practice, and has been welcomed by the independent adjudication authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the new provision, it will be up to the adjudication offier to decide whether the relevant change of circumstance is likely to occur. Where it does not so occur the decision would be corrected accordingly. Although the adjudication officer can review in advance of the change actually occuring, as now, his decision will take effect only from the date of change.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0483">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
The Government amendment allows for regulations which will link up this date of change with existing arrangements for pay-days and benefit weeks and I hope the Committee will accept it as a sensible improvement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 178, in page 24, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"11A. Section 35(4) of the 1986 Act shall cease to have effect.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 179, in page 24, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"11 A. In section 35(5) of the 1986 Act, after paragraph (a) there shall be inserted:—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(aa) to publish, in full or in part, such decisions of social fund inspectors as he considers will contribute to the improvement of the quality of decisions of social fund officers;".'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to repeal section 35(4) of the 1986 Act which deals with the recruitment of social fund inspectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the passage of the 1986 Act the Government failed to convince the Houses of Parliament that a discretionary entitlement should replace the old single payments scheme, which was an entitlement of right that had existed previously in law, without a proper procedure for appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government resisted to the end and continue to resist the idea that the appeal process should have independence before the law. Nevertheless, they were forced to head off an incipient Back Bench revolt which would have given the right of appeal to an independent tribunal. They concocted a scheme that had at least the appearance of allowing a decision under the social fund, which is a discretionary decision, to be reconsidered and for a claimant to have a fresh hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the Government had been forced to climb down, their original intention was that social fund inspectors would be ordinary DSS officials, although they would not be part of the local office staff hierachy. The Bill was amended in another place to provide a right of appeal to a tribunal which the Government could not sustain for two reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the social fund is discretionary. Secondly and, in the Government's view far more importantly, it is cash limited. The Government realised clearly that if there were the fully independent rights of appeal that have been enjoyed in this country since the 1930s and each case had to be examined on it merits, they could not make the enormous cuts in grants that they intended. On the grounds of potential savings the Government resisted the arguments for a proper right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To persuade the House to accept less, the Government invented more or less overnight another official—the Social Fund Commissioner—whose main purpose was to appoint inspectors. She was to be appointed by the Secretary of State and she could appoint only DSS officials as inspectors. It was plainly
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
the intention that inspectors should have as little independence as possible. They were to be subject to the Secretary of State's directions and guidance, as were the social fund officers whose decisions they would review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a lot of ministerial rhetoric about the independence of inspectors which, I must be frank, few of us took seriously. One of those who did was the Social Fund Commissioner, Mrs. Rosalind Macworth, who was the first person to hold that post. She is a solicitor, and she made it clear from the start that she intended inspectors to be as independent as the 1986 Act allows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With no disrespect to Mrs. Macworth, that is not saying a great deal. Inspectors cannot depart much further from the directions and guidance than social fund officers can. Inspectors cannot over-ride the cash limits, which is perhaps the most important restriction and they cannot hold oral hearings, which makes it more difficult for them to question discretionary decisions. However, the commissioner has encouraged inspectors to go carefully through the papers on each case to check whether the officer has asked the right questions and exercised discretion instead of blindly following what was thought to be the intention of the Secretary of State's guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result inspectors are often fairly outspoken in their criticism of decisions by social fund officers. I received the papers on such a case only shortly before our sitting started, so unfortunately I have not had time to study them at length. A constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) applied for a community care grant which was refused by the local social fund officer. An application was made for review and ultimately the papers passed to the inspector, who felt that the decision was wrong. I am only two thirds of the way through these papers, Mr. McWilliam, but there appears to be a strong possibility that the inspector came to that conclusion in the absence of any sufficiently clear evidence about why the initial decision had been made. In her letter of 30 November the inspector said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it must be clear, to the Inspector, that the Social Fund Officer has considered all the relevant law, directions and guidance and arrived at a reasonable decision (given the circumstances of the applicant)."</p></blockquote>
However, it is also clear that although the inspector chose to do what the Minister said was the Government's intention—to exercise her independence and try to see that the right decision had been made—a letter was sent to the inspector from the social fund officer, which said that he was not necessarily minded to accept the inspector's advice. He said that that was the view adopted
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the advice of the policy branch of this Department"</p></blockquote>
and that the decision was taken because of the difference between their policy intention for direction 4(a)(iii) and the social fund inspector's interpretation of that direction. The letter continues to comment on the provisions in the manual of guidance, to which the inspector had drawn attention, and finished by saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is easier to justify a decision made in the absence of any guidance than it is to justify one which involves the setting aside of clear guidance and"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0484">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
—this is the phraseology of the local social fund officer—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the flouting of known policy intentions."</p></blockquote>
That says much for the local inspector's decision, after receipt of advice from the regional office, the regional monitoring section of the social fund and the policy branch at head office. So much for the collective view and independence of the social fund inspector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a copy of a letter from the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security to my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) which says that there seems to be "differing interpretation" of the guidance on the social fund, it says that social fund officers will normally abide by the guidance—although in this case the social fund officer saw no reason to—and that the Secretary of State has no power either to influence the social fund officer or the social fund inspector. That is wholly admirable, but the reference in the social fund officer's remarks to the Department's policy intention and the guidance received from the policy section more or less to tell the inspector where to get off casts the suggestion of independence in a strange light.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members continue to believe that the social fund inspectors should be as independent as possible and that that independence should be sustained. At present, the inspectors are DSS officials who are paid by the Department and seconded to work under the guidance of the commissioner whose powers are limited to formally appointing them, arranging training, monitoring the quality of the inspectors' decisions and giving them advice and assistance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear from a report in 	<i>Community Care</i> in October 1988 that the Social Fund Commissioner already thinks that, to maintain the independence of inspectors, it should be possible for recruitment to take place on a wider base than at present. The magazine suggested that perhaps welfare rights groups, and so on, might be considered suitable to act as social fund inspectors. I am not sure that they would be prepared to take up such a role, but Opposition Members believe that if the commissioner wants to appoint people other than civil servants as social fund inspectors she should be allowed to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that the commissioner formally appoints inspectors, but under the section that the amendment seeks to repeal she is allowed only to appoint persons made available to the commissioner by the Secretary of State. I understand that the Secretary of State has the power to make available only his own officials. That is why we want to remove that restriction by repealing this section of the 1985 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members believe that the independence of the inspectorate should be maintained. In the cause of maintaining that independence, the Social Fund Commissioner should be able to appoint more widely than merely from officers made available to her by the Department. If the Minister stands by what he said in his letter, as opposted to what the local social fund officer in Bristol said in his remarks, he should readily accept the amendment or show in what other way the
	<span class='label label-info column'>836</span>
Department is prepared to allow the Social Fund Commissioner to widen the scope of the appointments that she wishes to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 179 discusses the decisions of social fund inspectors. We have already shown in principle that the decisions of social fund officers are discretionary. Since there is no proper right of appeal, there is no system of precedents to guide them. It is not surprising, therefore, that they have shown a distinct tendency to stick rigidly to the guidance issued by the Department in the social fund manual. Their decisions have often been more restrictive than is required either by the manual or by the cash limits imposed on each local office's expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures that the Department published about the levels of expenditure from the social fund clearly show that one of the reasons—the Government have tacitly accepted it—why community care grants are underspent is because social fund officers rigidly stick to the Department's guidelines.

The Department has shown no gratitude to Opposition Members for seeking to help it out. I was about to say that "my hon. Friend"—he certainly is, although he is not a Member of Parliament—who is our Committee adviser has, with others, slaved away and burnt the midnight oil to produce alternative guidance that certainly stays within the framework of the law and shows social fund officers where they might exercise a little more discretion than is provided by the Department's guidance. Nothing will be binding on social fund officers, but we have shown them where they have the right to exercise the discretion which the Department has not drawn so plainly to their attention as is done in this alternative briefing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of being grateful for our help to the Department and social fund officers, a rather surly letter was circulated which said that the alternative guidelines—although within the framework of the law, which is more than can be said for much of the Department's advice, not to mention the regulations that are issued from time to time—should be disregarded. That was not helpful, but we bear such burdens as cheerfully as we can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the decisions made by inspectors have provided a useful corrective to this too rigid exercise of guidance, and have sometimes pointed out where social fund officers have failed to exercise their discretion, or have treated the guidance as binding when it was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from a recent inspector's decision, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Social Fund Officer had interpreted the guidance in an inappropriately rigid way which has restricted the proper use of discretion, which I do not think is appropriate to the circumstances of this case."</p></blockquote>
It would be helpful if social fund officers, who are operating in something of a vacuum in a fairly new scheme, knew how the inspectors are approaching their task, what factors are being taken into account and how they are interpreting the guidance in the manual. Most social fund officers will have seen only a handful of inspectors' decisions—if, indeed, they have seen any at all. Claimants and their advisers will have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0485">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
seen none, except the decisions on cases in which they are personally involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 179 makes it possible for the Social Fund Commissioner to publish either selected decisions or extracts from decisions which in her judgment will provide a useful and more general guide for future cases. That will greatly increase the inspector's influence on the way in which the fund is administered and the chances of consistent decision-making—a difficulty that was identified when the fund was established. That will be wholly beneficial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may make some general observations on the hon. Lady's speech before moving to the two amendments. We sought to draw a distinction, as she will appreciate, between the usual appeal tribunals, which stick narrowly to regulations and legal requirements and a review system. It is the tribunals' job to see that the law has been fully and appropriately observed. This task is much more narrowly set than that of the social fund commissioners, who are asked to review decisions taken within a system of which a central feature—within the general law and rules—is discretion. This discretion enables social fund officers to meet specific circumstances and needs, which they feel should be met, and which could not easily be catered for in the context of firm and particular rules. The social fund was introduced for those reasons. It can operate more flexibly, and give help in a wider variety of cases, than the system which preceded it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady was right to say that moving from a system of rules and regulations without discretion means that social fund officers are moving into a new and different environment. It is not at all surprising that some were able to accept the opportunity of the new, more flexible system more readily than others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review system has an upper tier of social fund inspectors, who play an extremely important role. They fulfil it extremely well, seeing not only what decisions social fund officers are making but how they reach them; whether they take account of the full range and variety of factors in each case and whether they use their discretion fully, as their job requires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady quoted a specific case. I am not sure that I took on board all the details. It appears that a decision was referred back by a social fund inspector, and a social fund officer is supposed to have said that it was not in line with departmental policy and reinstated his original decision. Is that right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: More or less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, I make two observations. I will not say whether the decision was right or wrong because I do not know the circumstances, and the decision belongs to the social fund officer and is not for Ministers to comment on. If the officer retained his original decision, it would have been entirely right for the claimant to ask for a further review. Secondly, the social fund officer was wrong to look to departmental policy. He needed to look at the law and the guidance of the Secretary of State—these being set out in the social fund manual. If the hon. Lady gave a correct description of what happened, the decision was wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
Amendment No. 178 would allow the Social Fund Commissioner to choose from whom to recruit social fund inspectors, officers and staff rather than restrict her to people made available to her by the Secretary of State. The fact that the 44 inspectors who were in post when the social fund began were recruited from the Civil Service has genuine advantages. The article in 	<i>Community Care</i> which the hon. Member for Derby, South mentioned, recognises that fact. For people outside the service—especially those who did not have a close knowledge of the benefit system—the learning period would have been far too short. There is advantage in the inspectorate being able to draw directly on an existing pool of experienced staff where arrangements for transfer, pay and conditions are readily settled in line with Civil Service practice and without the inspector losing the opportunity of moving to other posts in the wider Civil Service. I am sure that existing rules ensure that the Social Fund Commissioner will have a larger pool of able, suitable people from which to draw than she would have had, if the inspectorate had been staffed from outside the Civil Service from the outset. It is clear from the Commissioner's remarks that she is well pleased with the quality and performance of her inspectors and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the hon. Lady's scepticism, I know that, when selected, the inspectors operate independently of the Department of Social Security, under the training and guidance of the commissioner. Judging by the reported comments in 	<i>Community Care,</i> a primary advantage of wider recruitment would be to convince sceptics that the inspectorate is as independent as the Commissioner knows it to be and is determined that it shall continue to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The nub of what I have to say to the hon. Member for Derby, South is that I do not believe that the amendment is necessary. Legislation permits the Secretary of State to make available candidates who are not civil servants, if he is persuaded that that is right and appropriate. It is early days in the development of the social fund. It has not completed its first year and the Commissioner still has to produce her first report. It would not be right at this stage to accept so sweeping an amendment. We paid close attention to the commissioner's views when deciding how the inspectorate can be helped to play its crucial role with professional skill and sensitivity, and in complete independence. My right hon. Friend's mind is open to suggestions about how the wider recruitment of inspectors and staff might contribute to that aim. Although I cannot accept the amendment, I hope that my comments will give the hon. Lady some encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to amendment No. 179, I am grateful to the hon. Lady for explaining more clearly than does the amendment what she has in mind. The effect of requiring the Social Fund Commissioner to publish the decisions of social fund inspectors which she thinks will help improve the quality of social fund officers' decisions, would be to produce a body of precedent to apply in other cases. It would be similar to the published decisions of the social security commissioners, where at all stages decisions are bound by law and regulation. That would be incompatible with a scheme that was based not on fixed regulations but on the reasonable exercise of discretion and intended to operate flexibily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When making their decisions, social fund officers are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0486">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>839</span>
bound by the law and the Secretary of State's general directions and they must also pay full regard to a number of other factors. This means that their decisions vary from case to case and from area to area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those factors include the facts and circumstances of an application—which are never quite the same, even in apparently similar cases—the list of priorities, and the Secretary of State's general guidance. With a discretionary shceme, some variation is inevitable. A flexible system that can act faster and more imaginatively than its predecessor necessarily means giving social fund officers discretion that could not be hidebound by the development of case law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, systematic publishing of social fund inspectors' decisions would tend to impose uniformity on social fund officers. The special system of review is designed to ensure that individual cases are handled fairly and that decisions are made impartially, free from bias and subject to a general test of reasonableness. That will guard against the misuse of discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from the article to which the hon. Member for Derby, South referred. The Social Fund Commissioner said what role she has and the benefit which she can be to the system, which is very different from the other existing appeal systems. She said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The inspectors are not there to impose their own judgment. Ours is a paper exercise which can't second guess the exercise of discretion. That must rightly be left to the social fund officer … What the inspector can do is to judge whether the case has been looked at with all options in mind. When something is clearly wrong we will intervene."</p></blockquote>
That describes the objective of the social fund and the role and purpose of the inspectors. The social fund commissioner may, of course, refer in her report to particular cases that she thinks are helpful in illustrating the way in which her inspectors fulfil their role, but I repeat that it would not be helpful if she sought to show how a particular case should have been decided in legalistic detail. That matter should normally be left to the social fund officers, who are aware of the circumstances of the case, and of the degree of discretion that they should apply in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the hon. Lady's aim, which is to convey to social fund officers a wider appreciation of their role, of what is possible within that role, and how they might use it, within the rules to help claimants best. However, I believe that systematic publication of the results of inspectors' findings would tend to militate against that desirable goal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister carefully, but he describes a world that is not familiar to me, nor I suspect to social fund officers or the social fund inspector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that nothing must be published about previous decisions because it might create undesirable rigidity and impose uniformity, and that we must not be hidebound, but that is precisely what is happening. We know that, the Minister knows that and even the Secretary of State has admitted that social fund officers are following the guidance in an undesirably rigid way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my experience and that of my hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>840</span>
Member for Bristol, South in the case to which I referred, social fund officers who are concerned about whether they are interpreting the guidance correctly and are allowed some flexibility do not commune with nature and make their decision in a little vacuum all on their own. They consult the regional team or the Department's policy headquarters. I understand from my experience and the experience of hon. Friends with whom I have discussed these matters that the advice which they are always given after such consultation is in most cases not to make payments and to stick rigidly by the guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the Minsiter said was most interesting, but it has nothing to do with what is happening. The position which the Minister describes is what is happening now, not some airy-fairy world in which social fund officers are operating, using their discretion and giving decisions right, left and centre. Every time they think they are in trouble, a fair number of social fund officers seem to run for advice, as did the social fund officer did in Bristol, South. He specifically sought the advice of the policy branch of the Department, which told him what the Department's policy intention was and to tell the social fund inspector to push off. As far as we can see, he attempted unsuccessfully to do, although the final episode of that case is not yet committed to paper. I hope that it will be unsuccessful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Clare Short (Birmingham, Lady wood)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the guidance cover the rate of repayment from the social fund for the few people who manage to obtain a loan? In a case recently brought to me, someone was required to repay £10.60 a week for a small benefit, which made it impossible for him to take up the loan. It was for a leaking toilet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may come within the Department's guidelines. If I remember rightly, the manual says that the normal rate of repayment would be about 15 per cent of a benefit. I believe that it can sometimes be as high as 20 per cent. Certainly there is a discretion to allow a lower rate of repayment of, say, 10 per cent or even 5 per cent if the claimant's circumstances allow. That would usually happen if the claimant already had other debts, which is quite likely, particularly fuel debts, which made it impossible for him to repay more than that. So yes, the guidance is even specific about matters of that sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, it is my impression from the cases which have been drawn to my attention that the discretion to award a lower rate of repayment is rarely mentioned. Where a loan is awarded, quite a high rate of repayment is usually set, and only if the person involved squeals like a stuck pig and goes elsewhere to get welfare advice is a lower rate finally accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to use that the social fund is working out more as we expected than as the Department said or, indeed, as is borne out by what the Minister has said today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote a different case, in which a different social fund inspector said that the officer had interpreted the guidance in an inappropriately rigid way. The Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0487">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>841</span>
said that inspectors are limited to deciding whether discretion has been exercised rightly, but even though the fund is administered in that way, it is clear that there is much dissatisfaction in the inspectorate with some of the decisions that are being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To suggest that social fund officers would be bound and not assisted by examples of how they had been too rigid in exercising their discretion is extraordinary. It turns the whole argument on its head. Nothing in the Parliamentary Under-Secretary's remarks show that we should not press for the publication of some decisions, not necessarily in this Committee but in other ways and over a period. Knowing how conscientious the Social Fund Commissioner is, I have little doubt that she will study the report of our proceedings, and I hope that she will be encouraged to give consideration to the idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted what the Minister said about the appointments that the Social Fund Commissioner can make. Here again, if I can interpret the Minister's observations, it seemed to me that he was saying that the present inspectors are doing a jolly good job, they are a good lot and it shows what a good thing it was to appoint them from within the Department—with none of which we particularly disagree—and that the Social Fund Commissioner is quite happy with them. It appears that the Social Fund Commissioner, although happy with the quality of people presently serving on her staff, would like to be able to cast her net more widely in future. I hope that that means that, the Department will accept the proposals which have been made and that it has found a way in which to meet that suggestion. If it does not, I have little doubt that the various processes of social security legislation in the House will offer us an opportunity to raise the matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The matters are important to us in this place, and will have profound effects on decisions
	<span class='label label-info column'>842</span>
made outside. We shall therefore try to probe the Government's intentions and to set them in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the briefing to Conservative Back-Bench Members the Government said with charming frankness that the Department had consulted widely about the legislation. That was the catechism. I do not recall whether you, Mr. Winterton, were privileged to hear the catechism when you were with us before. It began, "Was there public consultation? Yes. Parties consulted included the Association of British Insurers, the CBI, the TUC, the Law Society, the Law Society of Scotland, the Bar Council and medical insurance bodies. Pause. Understandably, all those consulted prefer the present system."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was commendably frank, but not as frank as the Government were in the notes on clauses. As some kind soul sent us a copy of the briefing to Back-Bench Members, the position is clear to all members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the experts—whether they represent the insurance companies which are often involved in making payments, the employers who pay the original premiums and against whose liability judgment will later be made, or those who represent and negotiate on behalf of the victims—and all the bodies that deal day-to-day with the way in which damages are assessed and awarded by our courts have spoken with one voice and said that, whatever the difficulties and anomalies of the present system, the system proposed by the Government will be worse. Of course, when the Government undertake consultation, they do not intend to listen to anything that anyone says in response. Consequently, the Government steam-roller happily ahead, a circumstance that we hope to be able to change in this part of the Committee proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The current legislation—mainly under the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948 and in particular under section 2(1) of that Act—provides for the deduction of half the value of certain benefits in the assessment of damages, but the deduction is to be made only in respect of the part of the damages that compensates for loss of earnings. It is vital to bear that in mind when considering how the clause will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deduction is not made against general damages—for example, for pain and suffering—or for financial loss other than earnings, such as loss of clothing, damage to a vehicle or the cost of adaptations to the home. If one part of the benefit is more than the damages for loss of earnings, the excess is not deductible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the clause would be to increase the deduction from 50 per cent at present to 100 per cent, and to allow the value of benefits to be deducted from all parts of the damages payment. That would further reduce the net damages received by injury victims. That is why amendment No. 188 seeks to maintain the present position, so that the deduction on account of benefits would be restricted to the part of the compensation payment that is attributable to loss of earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1948, most of the benefits replaced loss of earnings. The one exception was industrial disablement benefit and, even that was regarded, in part, as compensation for the loss of earnings capacity, not directly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0488">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>843</span>
for loss of earnings. That was why the judgment was made, although even then there was an argument about whether any deduction should be made at all. However, a compromise between the different points of view was reached, and the level of deduction was set at 50 per cent against only damages for loss of earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, the scope of social security benefits has broaded under Labour and Conservative Governments to include mobility allowance and attendance allowance. The Department seems to be arguing that the risk of double compensation may not any longer be limited to damages for loss of earnings. The logic of that argument is that, if recoupment were to be extended to benefits other than those that deal with loss of earnings, surely it should be met only out of the part of compensation for attendance and mobility costs. But the Government are not proposing to do that. Under the clause, they intend to lump together all the allowances and recover all the benefits paid out of the compensation payment. Amendment No. 188 seeks to avoid some of the worst injustices that might result from such a process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 188 would meet the arguments of the Government and others that the present law causes difficulties because it is inconsistent. As the law has developed, some benefits can be recovered at 50 per cent, while others can be recovered at 100 per cent. Naturally, the Government in their usual generous fashion have decided to level down, instead of up, so that recovery can be made at 100 per cent. The obvious alternative to that, if the benefits are to be treated equally, is to recover them all at 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 189 would continue the approach adopted in the existing legislation under which one half of the value of the benefits is taken into account in the calculation. It would avoid injury victims having their net damages cut by 100 per cent. We have been advised by the Trades Union Congress that workpeople suffering accidents at work or contracting an occupational disease would be especially affected by the 100 per cent reduction. The Touche Ross study commissioned by the Government estimated that three quarters of the recoverable benefits would come for employers' liability to settlements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment recognises the Government's argument that there should be the same level of deduction. It recognises also the argument of the Confederation of British Industry that workpeople have contributed specifically to the funding of national insurance benefits, including industrial injury benefits. In January, the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) in response to his letter about the CBI, which was contesting the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply, Lord Skelmersdale stated that the liability to pay compensation for injury was not linked in any way to the payment of a national insurance contribution, which goes into the central fund and provides for many contingencies, including the payment of retirement, widows' and invalidity pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the next paragraph, the Minister talked about the
	<span class='label label-info column'>844</span>
way in which the payment of a national insurance contribution may give entitlement to benefits dealing with injury or illness. So it is clearly acknowledged—although, with the Government's usual roundabout phraseology, it appears not to be—that payment into the national insurance fund is part of the way in which people pool the risk of possible injury or sickness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government might have been on stronger ground in contesting this part of the argument had they not been so unwise—I think in clause 2—as to abolish the Treasury supplement to national insurance funds. From this April, the Government clearly intend that the national insurance fund shall be financed wholly, as it is almost wholly financed now, from the contributions of employers and employees. It seems wrong that the Government should, at the same time, propose wholly to disregard the fact that the benefits which might be paid from the national insurance funds will be paid, at least in part, in recognition of the contributions that the injured person has made to the fund. That is part of the reason behind the TUC's suggestion that the Government should consider, if they are going ahead with this clause—and we would prefer that they do not—a much lower level of deduction of 50 rather than 100 per cent. I look forward to the Minister's reply to these issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It seems to me that if the CBI is against something, we are probably justified in being in favour of it. But taxpayers' money should not be used to subsidise negligence and double recovery of damages is wrong. I ask myself who is speaking against this, and I reply that it is those who would have to pay. The answer to them is simple: if they are not negligent they will not have to pay anything."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 10 January 1989; Vol. 144, c.776.]</p></blockquote>
We ought to examined the truth of the matter, because those who lobbied me when I said that had patently not done so before they came to see me. As I see it, the current position is a mess and these amendments would only make it worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the benefits over the past 40 years have been ignored by legislation. Some have been deducted in full, others in part and some covered by 40 years of case law. The result is that sometimes there is double recovery, sometimes insurance companies and those who are negligent pocket the savings, but always the taxpayer loses. Such a mess, frankly, needs clearing up pretty smartish. This clause does that. Its aim—which must not be watered down by these amendments—is to set out some clear principles. First, as Beveridge said, there should be no double recovery in cases of this sort. Secondly, there should be no subsidy of negligence by the British taxpayer. At the same time, the new system
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0489">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>845</span>
must make sure that it safeguards the victims of negligence and only seeks to recover where the effort is worthwhile. It seems to me that if we can recover £55 million in exchange for spending £2.5 million this clause has got it about right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who is objecting? The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) described the objectors as expert, but I would describe them as those with vested interests in objecting and maintaining the status quo. Those who are objecting are those who are pocketing the savings now. They are either negligent, or seek to represent those who are negligent by offering them insurance. Such people are not disinterested experts, but prefer a taxpayers' subsidy to clause 18. Let me say to them, "The remedy lies in your own hands. Simply don't be negligent, and you will not have to pay. Alternatively, persuade those who are negligent not to be and the premiums will not have to rise, and there need be no extra cost". In any event, it will not be the taxpayer who has to foot the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are right to bring in the provision, and to protect the taxpayer. Clause 18 will do no harm to the victims, and will put the consequence of negligence where it belongs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon.

I have welcomed his support on a number of occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments aim to cut the amounts by which compensation is reduced to take account of the benefit paid. As we are beginning our debate, it is worth reminding ourselves what Sir William Beveridge said in his report in 1942 on the problem of alternative remedies. The first issue he considered was precisely this—industrial accidents. Beveridge said, at paragraph 259,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Under the first head, one general principle seems clear: The possible existence of alternative remedy should not prevent an insured person from getting forthwith whatever social security benefits he would have been entitled to claim if he had no such remedy. The testing of any alternative remedy is bound to take some time; the needs of the injured person should be met at once. Prompt maintenance of income is of the essence of social security.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The present arrangements under which the possible existence of a
	<span class='label label-info column'>846</span>
claim against an employer is ground for refusing sickness benefit to disabled workmen should be ended. So also should the requirement that an employee must elect between claiming under the Workmen's Compensation Act and claiming at common law."</p></blockquote>
Both steps were, of course, taken, although there are many advanced industrialised countries where someone who suffers from an accident has to elect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir William went on, at paragraph 260,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Another general principle also is clear. An injured person should not have the same need met twice over. He should get benefit at once without prejudice to any alternative remedy, but if the alternative remedy proves in fact to be available, he should not in the end get more from two sources together than he would have got from one alone."</p></blockquote>
Sir William went on to develop the argument in detail. I believe that as we come to debate the series of amendments to the clause, we should remember those basic principles, which I find it difficult to quarrel with, and I think no member of the Committee would either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now put those principles in the context of the amendments before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 188 aims to restrict recoupment to that part of a compensation payment which is made for loss of earnings or profits—known to lawyers as special damages. I hope that the Committee will not fall into the trap of imagining that all, or even a majority or substantial minority of cases under this heading are dealt with by the courts. Eighty five per cent of compensation payments are made informally. Compensators do not express payments in terms of special damages—that is, payment for loss of earnings or profits. They do not distinguish between special damages and general damages, which compensate people for pain and suffering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In almost every other case, including those with a court judgment, special damages are agreed informally between the parties. The Touche Ross report shows that in practice benefits form only a small percentage of special damages, even when they are expressed. Loss of earnings for which compensation is sought is usually far greater than benefit payments. As the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said, not all benefits are paid for loss of earnings. Mobility allowance, attendance allowance and disablement benefit fall into that category. The amount to be recouped is usually far less than the loss of earnings compensation. When it is not, the benefits will often be those that do not relate to loss of earnings, such as attendance allowance, mobility allowance or disablement benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 189 would restrict recoupment to the value of half the benefits paid. At present, half of some benefits are offset—that is retained by the compensator under the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948. It is perhaps a pity that those who drew up that legislation after the second world war did not reflect in the legislation the principles that Sir William Beveridge had laid down. A compromise was reached because it was impossible to obtain agreement on the way in which benefits should be treated in relation to compensation payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts have ruled on several occasions since, that benefits that are not specifically covered by the 1948 Act should be deducted in full to avoid double compensation. The new legislation provides for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0490">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>847</span>
recoupment only up to the date of settlement. If settlement is made up to two and a half years after injury, the effect of 100 per cent recoupment is no different from 50 per cent—or even 100 per cent offset over five years. Eighty per cent of claims are settled within two and a half years, so the majority of victims will see no cash difference in the amount that they receive from the compensator. The difference in the provision is that the compensator will no longer be able to subsidise his liability to pay compensation because benefits have been paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is astonishing that Opposition Members advance the argument that negligent, guilty, careless employers should be subsidised by taxpayers instead of being under every incentive to insure themselves properly and minimise the risks to their employees. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) lives in his constituency, which includes Heathrow airport. He may be pleased if the clause is not accepted because his constituents may suffer damage to hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to defend those who should receive benefits. It is noteworthy that the hon. Member for Spelthorne was dismissive of the fact that those who deal with such cases and have expertise in the subject reject the Government's proposals. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has considered the report of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council. Perhaps that is one of the bodies whose evidence he has not considered closely—if, indeed, he has considered any evidence closely, other than the sheet sent round by the CBI. The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council has nothing to gain by opposing the legislation, yet it does so in a cogent and well-argued document, which also examines the question of double compensation. The Council is not an interested party, except by virtue of its expertise. It believes that whatever the difficulties and drawbacks of the present system, the Government—not for the first time—have succeeded in suggesting an even worse system. If the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) is putting forward a serious case rather than merely seeking to endear himself to his hon. Friend, I advise him to study the Council's arguments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister apparently found it astonishing that we should act in the way that he described. I was also astonished when the Minister quoted carefully from Beveridge about double compensation and said that we should all pay heed to Beveridge's views. It may be within your memory, Mr. McWilliam—and it will certainly be within the memory of your fellow Chairman, Mr. Winterton—that Beveridge was pretty rude about
	<span class='label label-info column'>848</span>
the central tenet of the Bill, as revealed in clauses 7, 9 and 10. Those clauses re-enact the principle that people should be tested as to whether they are genuinely seeking work. Beveridge said that that test should never rise from its dishonoured grave, yet the Government have disinterred it. It is no good their recommending us to listen to Beveridge today when they so specifically disregard his advice in the core proposals of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the issue of double compensation on which Beveridge wrote and spoke the one that is at stake here? Again I draw the attention of the Minister and the Committee to the comments and observations of those whom I regard as more expert than the hon. Member for Spelthorne. Lawyers who deal with such cases may stand to benefit from the clause—the hon. Member for Spelthorne is wrong there. Lawyers, like all the other experts who have commented, believe that the proposals will lead to a great increase in litigation, delays and costs. Far more cases will be taken to court rather than being settled earlier, so lawyers stand to benefit substantially, but because their clients will be the victims they do not wish to benefit at their expense. Lawyers therefore point to the delays in settlements that will be caused and say that inconsidering the proposals the Committee should take into account the fact that at present inadequate compensation is often paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TUC suggests that there is nothing wrong with injury victims receiving compensation from more than one source if one source alone is inadequate. The National Audit Office, like the hon. Member for Spelthorne, argued that the wrongdoer in tort cases should not have the cost of his negligence subsidised by public funds, but the TUC comments that that principle could be used to reduce further an award that is already likely to fall far short of full compensation. The TUC believes that the primary objective should be full compensation for people who are injured. If the present working of the system means that full compensation requires payments both from a tort award and from state benefits, both should be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council commented at length on the observations of the Pearson Commission report. In the council's view, the complex relationship between the different benefits and payment entitlements was not adequately considered; it believes that the report made an inadequate judgment. The council says that although tort damages are in theory intended to provide full compensation, in practice that is not so, especially in industrial injuries cases. People cannot prove negligence, or do not believe that they can prove it. They are unaware of their rights. In the council's experience, in the majority of cases the damages awarded do not provide full compensation for injuries suffered, either because the settlement is not pursued, or because of a range of other reasons which we may need to consider in debates on later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council looked carefully and in depth at the way in which the compensation system works. It concluded that far from the Government being able to prevent people from receiving double compensation, the existing compensation system is so inadequate that even before they get their greedy hands on it the Govern-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0491">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>849</span>
ment penalise those whose compensation is already inadequate. On a makeshift basis, through a combination of tort compensation payments, benefits and so on, some people are getting rather more compensation for their injuries at present than they are likely to receive in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the Minister is being less than honest with the Committee by pretending that full—indeed, double—compensation is paid at present and that the Government are merely trying to remedy that fault. That is not what happens under the present law. There is little doubt that whatever excuse the Government may make for their action, it will be the victims who suffer. Furthermore, the system will encounter serious difficulties to which we shall draw attention in later debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should answer our question as to whether it is right for the Government to proceed with their proposals. I presume that he, too, has read the reports, so he must be familiar with the strong arguments that suggest that inadequate compensation is being paid at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with that point directly. In practice, 99 per cent of cases are settled without the need for a court decision. Most are settled informally by arrangement between the insurers—otherwise known as the compensators—and the injured persons. Other cases may get into the court process, but they are settled before a court has to make a decision on them. It must be in the minds of the compensator and the victim and his advisers, if I may so describe the injured party, that benefits have been paid in the interim. No doubt, that will reflect the willingness of the injured party to accept and the willingness of the compensator to offer a particular level of compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that such a system is grossly unfair to taxpayers. They should not be expected to subsidise proper compensation arrangements, which frequently do not end with money in the pocket of the injured person. The money not offered, despite the fact that an employer may have insured fully against such a contingency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the Committee to reject the amendments. I believe that the underlying principle of recovery is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with much of what the Minister said. On the other hand, the matter will arise in debates on other amendments. The Minister said that many cases are settled without the need for a court decision. I agree that that is so. We argue that that could be advantageous, but the clause is likely to create serious problems for that system in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier that the Government would resist the amendments because compensation payments are not normally identified. Again, that is something that we shall consider under later amendments, as it is likely to create serious problems. I wish to register the fact that there are serious counter arguments to the points that the Minister is making, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) mentioned the uncertain ground on which the Government stand. However, they are about to venture into quicksand if the provision stays as drafted. The Government are introducing a series of freshly-minted injustices and anomalies to solve the difficulties under the present law. Not all problems, however, can be solved by creating greater ones. We have only to glance at the many amendments tabled by the Government for evidence of the difficulties in which they now find themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We share the Government's confusion about the provisions. Amendment No. 261 seeks a way out of that confusion. The Bill will create an enormous cost problem. Such costs have always been distinct when compensation has been paid for pain, injury or loss of earnings, for example. We do not accept the argument for clawing back costs out of payments made under the social security system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 196 states that a compensation payment includes
	<br><blockquote><p>"so much of the payment as represents reimbursement for costs incurred in procuring it".</p></blockquote>
That means that the DSS can claw back benefits out of the part of the compensation payment which is for costs, leaving the victim, in many cases, worse off than if he had not claimed damages. It is not clear whether a separate payment for costs—which is more often than not the case—would count as a compensation payment, or only as a payment that included costs as well as compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 197 says, in effect, that the "relevant period"—the period during which any benefit payments are liable to be clawed back subsequently—ends when the claim is settled, even if the payment of "taxed costs" remains outstanding. In most cases, costs are agreed between the parties and are not taxed in the way that the amendment suggests. It is not clear why such a distinction is made. Does the proposal mean that untaxed costs count as compensation, but taxed costs do not? If so, why?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole issue of costs is baffling. The only satisfactory solution would be to ensure that, however the costs are paid and whether or not they are taxed, benefits should not be recovered out of any payment, or part of any payment, which is intended to reimburse the victim's costs. That is the purpose of amendment No. 261. We hope that the Government's rethink stage 1 will be followed by rethink stage 2, in which costs will be eliminated from their proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are back to a familiar problem, which is that only 1 per cent of cases are decided by the courts. In the remaining 99 per cent of cases a single lump sum
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0492">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>851</span>
is paid. Often there is no breakdown of the amounts paid for costs. The Touche Ross report shows that benefits usually form only a small part of the amount expressed for special damages for loss of earnings. In practice it is unlikely that a settlement would be agreed that did not cover the victim's costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legal aid charges are protected in paragraph 7 of schedule 2. If, exceptionally, insufficient money was available to meet those charges, the Secretary of State would repay to the legal aid fund the difference from the amount recouped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unacceptable because, to keep the scheme straightforward, the Department will not make inquiries about the settlements and how they have been worked out. That would simply lead to delay, argument and possibly manipulation of the allocation of different elements of the single sum settlement, which is the practice in the overwhelming proportion of cases. We do not want to delay matters by insisting that costs are investigated and decided independently and impartially. We are satisfied that in practice there should be no problem. The amount to be recouped should fall within the payment excluding costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wish to avoid doubt that the definition of compensation payment includes costs. Government amendment No. 196 clarifies the meaning of compensation payment to include costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 197 is designed to ensure that the period for which benefits are recovered is not unduly extended in a court case. In such a case, judgment may be given and damages paid fairly quickly, but the costs are then "taxed"—that is, worked out—which may take considerable time. Without the amendment the relevant period for recoupment would continue to run. The amendment ensures that the relevant period ends when the judgment is paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Government amendment No. 201 relates to paragraph 7 of schedule 2. As the title implies, it places a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that recoupment is not prejudicial to the legal aid fund. It is a technical amendment to remove an ambiguity so that the Secretary of State cannot pay over to the legal aid fund more than he has received by way of recoupment.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>852</span>
The Minister has not answered the question of whether there is a difference between "taxed" costs and those that are not "taxed", nor has he dealt with the main difficulty, which is the special nature of costs. The thrust of the Government's argument is to avoid double compensation, but costs are an expenditure, not a form of compensation. In the interests of simplified justice, which we all support, the Government create an injustice. In a current case, one of my constituents is querying the costs, which have amounted to one third of his total compensation. I understand that that is not unusual and that they are sometimes much higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In every case there is a clear, easily measured difference between costs and the other part of the compensation. We are dissappointed that the Minister has not recognised that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I have found my papers, I shall speak to the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments is based on the principle that when a compensation payment comprises two or more elements—for example, loss of earnings, expenses, paid and suffering, and so on—benefits that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0493">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>853</span>
are intended for specific purposes should be recoverable, if at all, only from the corresponding part of the compensation. Clause 18 has been widely criticised for failing to recognise that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to quote from a letter from a firm of solicitors that specialises in such cases. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"No provision is made in the Bill to deduct benefits from the claim that they most relate to. For example, if statutory sick pay is to be deducted then it should only be deducted from loss of earnings, not in respect of the Bill as presently drafted would result in the erosion of damages … the purpose of damages is an attempt by the law to put the plaintiff in the position that he/she was prior to the accident. This can only be done by financial compensation. The effect of this Bill would be to erode this principle. This has never been done before. In the case of Parry v. Cleaver"—</p></blockquote>
I cannot remember how far back that case was, but it is fundamental and has set the case law for many years. In that case—
	<br><blockquote><p>"it was established that you should only take away 'like from like'."</p></blockquote>
I have referred to the criticism made by the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council of some of the recommendations of the Pearson commission. That commission took the view that the reduction of benefit should be regarded as taking like from like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more recent decision in Hodgson v. Trapp on whether attendance allowance should be taken away was that it should be subtracted from the claim for care but not from more general claims. It appears that the courts—certainly in Parry v. Cleaver in 1969 and Hodgson v. Trapp, one in the House of Lords and the other in the Court of Appeal—have decided that that is how deduction of benefits should be treated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The TUC has made the same point. I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Despite all the allegations of double compensation, little attention has been given to the fact that a damages award includes elements relating to different types of losses and extra expenses, and that different State benefits also serve different purposes which broadly correlate to the different heads of damages. Even if the allegation of double compensation is accepted"—</p></blockquote>
As I said on an earlier amendment, the TUC does not accept the allegation—
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would clearly be illogical and unjust to deduct the value of a benefit provided to meet one loss or need from a part of a damages award intended as compensation for a different loss or need."</p></blockquote>
The Law Society has also suggested that the clause should be amended so that the recoveries from benefits should be limited to that head of damage for which benefit was paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fundamental objection to the idea of recovery of benefit from compensation payments is that even if the principle of like from like is accepted, it is difficult to apply it consistently. We shall raise that issue on later amendments. We are considering cases where judgment is given in the High Court, where a transcript of the decision is available and where a decision about the calculation of damages can be given on a judicial basis. It is then possible to identify the precise basis of the compensation payment. As the Minister argued in resisting our previous amendment, that might not be so easy in other courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We recognise that there may be difficulties in some circumstances in matching the head of damages award and the payment of benefit. It is not enough for the
	<span class='label label-info column'>854</span>
Government to argue—irrespective of the merits of the case and of the justice of their proposals—that they should act in the easiest way and the one that gets the maximum return for them without considering how the action will be viewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are a partial and, no doubt, imperfect attempt to incorporate the principles of like from like deductions into the clause. They seek to provide that where different heads of damages can be identified, any benefit which corresponds to a particular head should be recoverable only out of that head of damages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that that will confirm a principle that is now fairly widely applied. It is a principle that should be enshrined in legislation. The Government should not act in the way most convenient to them. We will then have to try to reconcile cases where that will not be an easy judgment to make. We may deal with that on later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the amendment we seek to follow the practice that the Government so frequently pursue by saying that this is a principle that should be adopted but that the Secretary of State should be able to specify in regulations how benefits are to be matched to different heads of damages. The Government almost invariably prefer that course of action to writing details into primary legislation, and in these circumstances we feel that it is justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Derby, South said, the three amendments would import the concept that benefits should be recoverable under specific heads of damages, so that if the total benefit paid under a heading exceeded the amount of compensation paid under the same heading there would be a limit to the possible recoupment. I do not want to sound like a gramophone record, but again that is out of tune with the practice in settling such cases. In at least 85 per cent of settlements there is no breakdown of the heads of damages. A global sum is settled between the two parties in an informal settlement, not an award by a court. Only in 1 per cent of cases does a court award damages, and even there the special damages are usually agreed informally. I look forward to considering in detail the case put to the hon. Lady by the solicitor, but in essence the principle that she seeks to advance is an unnecessary complication in a system that works well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present both parties know how much benefit is being paid. In future they will know the total payment, and that it will be recouped. The victim or his solicitor will want to ensure as far as possible that the settlement reflects the fact that benefits will be recouped, just as it now reflects the fact that benefits are offset. I am sure that that will happen, and to insist that such settlements, the vast majority of which are made informally, must all break down the total between the different heads would be excessively bureaucratic and legalistic. It would waste both time and money. The recommendation of the Pearson commission regarding the allocation of benefits to separate heads of damages has never been taken up for the offsetting of benefits. I see no reason to advise the Committee to introduce such
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0494">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>855</span>
complications into a straightforward scheme that will be clearly understood by both parties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is ridiculous and outrageous. I do not know how the Minister has the gall to describe our suggestion as bureaucratic and legalistic. Unless he shows a more sensible attitude to our future amendments than he has displayed so far, his scheme will demand certificates of totals of benefit in many circumstances where no benefits will be paid. He is introducing a range of provisions that will increase costs and add an extra area of administration for insurance companies, employers, and even victims if they work for a firm that is not a British company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that we suggest that deductions should be made only in those categories where it is possible to identify the different heads of damages. That is the minimum that the Government should accept. It is the basis on which case law and the framework of procedures has been built. It was accepted by the Pearson commission and by everyone else except the Government. The Minister resists the idea because it is not convenient and because the Government would recover less money if they paid attention to the way in which damages are awarded and claims paid, not because it is not sensible, let alone not just.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Mr. Cunliffe) is introducing a Bill which seeks to remedy the inadequate damages and compensation paid to victims of accident and injury. The Bill has considerable support outside the House and, until today, I though that it was also supported by hon. Members. Even if my hon. Friend's Bill is successful, the Goverment are running very fast to make sure that no victim will retain much benefit from it, and I am sure that my hon. Friend is extremely anxious about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disgraceful that the Minister has attempted to dismiss a vital point of principle in the law. The Law Society has written to us because it is very worried about the issue. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order there appear to be two Committees in this Room. I should be obliged if hon. Gentlemen would listen to the hon. Lady. The argument is complicated and I have to listen carefully to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has referred several times to the problem of identifying far ahead which debates are best confined to certain amendments. The Minister has talked about the way in which the system works now in every amendment. Whatever is the present system relating to informal settlements and the award of global sums that do not take account of certain damage, the Government are about to tear it up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will destroy the comparative informality that exists. It is no good the Minister shaking his
	<span class='label label-info column'>856</span>
head—he knows that were right. No one with any confidence that his client will win in court would opt for a settlement that would involve guessing what benefits might be lost. The measure will mitigate against the procedures of informal settlement with a global sum that is generally identified. The Minister does not think that that would be so, but those who prepresent victims, insurance companies, employers and other groups say that it will mean increased delays, increased bureaucracy and administration and a reduction in settlements. The amendment would solve the difficulties that the measure will create.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me explain who in the Committee is on the side of the victims. In briefings to lawyers and insurers, officials of the Minister's Department made it plain that they will expect Department of Social Security benefits to be repaid irrespective of whether that repayment exhausts the element in the settlement or award of damages to the victim which has been designated as compensation for pain and suffering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the payment of damages in which the different heads of damages have been identified and there is no doubt that part of the sum has been awarded for pain and suffering. The Department is telling those involved behind the backs of the Committee and the House, "We do not care whether the damages have been awarded in recompense for pain and suffering. If we have to get our money back by taking money awarded for pain and suffering, we are perfectly content to do that." The Minister then talked glibly about the excessively bureaucratic and legalistic difficulties in trying to prevent a Department from doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example. It is a case that is likely to be settled without going to court to receive a judicial verdict and it involves an individual who recently lost the sight of an eye in an accident. He has not sustained any loss of earnings, the employers dispute liability, and if the case goes to court, there is always the possibility—my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) will deal with this under another amendment—of a decision on contributory negligence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The realistic maximum value of the person's claim is about £20,000. Although it is likely to be an informal settlement, and although there is no precise indentification of heads of damages, it appears that £5,000 is an amount for which there is much precedent in courts in recent years as compensation for the risk of someone being on the open labour market and the additional difficulty that such a person might face in securing alternative employment—in this case, because of disability. In this informal settlement, there is a clear understanding between the parties involved that the standard amount of compensation for the risk and difficulty in finding future employment is included, and that roughly about £15,000 would be included to compensate the injured person for pain, suffering and loss of amenity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The person in this case has been advised to accept that sum, and it appears likely, although we do not know for sure, that a deduction in excess of £8,000 will be made for the benefits that he might receive. That deduction will come, not from his possibly negligent employers, as the hon. Member for Spelthorne,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0495">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>857</span>
implied, but from the compensation that he might otherwise receive for pain, suffering and loss of amentiy and the manner in which his future employment prospects have been compromised. It is a large amount to lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that case, the way in which the level of payment has been decided is relatively clear, but often when there is a compromise, the parties do not tell each other the sums on which the compromise is based. If benefit deduction is allowed only against the relevant heads of damages, a more complicated system may be needed to record the judgment reached in terms of an overall proportion of the settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we do not suggest that this procedure is less complicated than the existing procedure, but people will probably lose, most unfairly and unjustly, unless we have such a proceduure. As I said when I referred to the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh, the public broadly take the view that levels of compensation are inadequate. As I see it, the Government are setting a time bomb for themselves, because it can only be a matter of time before a judgment is made, under the combination of the existing damages system and clause 18, in which someone who, in the judgment or ordinary people, should receive damages, perhaps even sustantial damages, yet will have those damages severely cut and perhaps almost wiped out by the prior claims of the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's reply was dismissive and inappropriate to the scale of the problem. "Inappropriate" is always a serious word in Civil Service language. The reply was wholly inappropriate to the seriousness of the matter and the substantial argument that has been advanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not apologise for repeating that according to all those who deal extensively with and have considerable experience of the scheme, one of the most damaging aspects of the clause is the possibility of conflict arising from the principle of heads of damages being taken into account when offsetting benefits. The Minister owes it to the Committee to be more sensible in his observations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly, although the hon. Lady may think inadequately so. We are moving into a new and more sensible system that will be fairer to the taxpayer. I realise that those who operate the existing scheme do not like change and upheaval—few people do. But perhaps they and the hon. Lady underestimate the speed with which people will adjust to the new arrangements. Both parties will know how much benefit has been paid and how much will be liable to be recovered. That factor will no doubt be taken into account in the overwhelming majority of cases which are settled informally. When that is not so, the courts can take it into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret that the Minister's response simply will not do. I draw his attention again to the remarks made by the Law Society of Scotland. It observed that the social security regime has never compensated for items such as pain, suffering and loss of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>858</span>
The Minister's proposal is that benefits should be clawed back, but the reason for payment of the award may be entirely different from why benefits were paid. That is patently unjust. I do not believe that the Government do not realise that. It is merely convenient for them to recover those sums. It is not as if the levels of benefits paid are so high that anyone could think that those who suffer disability do not have considerable difficulty in managing. Our view is that serious problems are likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall cite one more example before I advise my hon. Friends to vote on the amendment. It is a case report of someone who would be affected by the Bill's provisions. It might shake the Government's complacency a little. This person suffered psychiatric problems which began after an accident at work in October 1982. A difficult medical argument ensued. There were arguments about liability and, perhaps inevitably as a psychiatric difficulty was involved, about causation. Ultimately, a compromise settlement of £20,000 was reached. The offer contained no breakdown either for the period of time off or for financial loss. The offer was simply of a lump sum to settle the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the date of the accident to the date of the trial—this probably relates to the fact that it was such a difficult matter medically to resolve—the person involved had received £21,000 in DSS benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over what period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the date of the accident to the date of the trial. No time was given, but it could not have been so very long because the accident happened in 1982. The chances are that it was within the time period that would be caught by the legislation as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Later, we shall discuss the issuing of the certificates. Under the present proposals it would be difficult to settle the case as speedily as was then possible because of the need to obtain a certificate verifying the gross amount of benefits. Moreover, it is possible that the plaintiff would not receive compensation—if the clause remains unamended—because as much, if not more, would have to be repaid to the DSS as had been paid in benefits. It would be sensible for the plaintiff to consider only an offer in excess of his DSS benefits. That would make it impossible to settle the claim. The matter would go to court and cost much more in terms of time, trauma, legal costs and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of settlement in the case to which I have referred do not bear any relation to the DSS benefits received. That matter would be dealt with separately. We are anxious because under the clause as drafted, compensation will be wiped out for anyone in similar circumstances merely for the administrative convenience of the Government and to make savings. The difficulties faced by the plaintiff in identifying the nature of his suffering and his lifelong problems will be ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is unjustified. It highlights the advice in the briefing to Back Bench Conservatives that some people will lose. It is hard to see that anyone will benefit. Any psychiatric problems will be exacerbated by the discovery that the benefits awarded will be wholly, or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0496">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>859</span>
almost wholly, wiped out, and the sufferer is likely to remain a further charge on the state at considerable expense for a long time. No one will benefit except, in the most narrow accounting sense, the DSS. But the DSS and the Department of Health will have to face the consequences of the damage to individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 190, in Clause 18, page 13, line 23, leave out from "accident" to the end of line 24 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or injury; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(aa) deduct from the payment an amount, determined in accordance with the certificate of total benefit, equal to a proportion of the gross amount of any relevant benefits paid or likely to be paid to or for the victim during the relevant period in respect of that disease equal to the proportion in respect of which the compensator is compensating the victim of the total period of the victim's exposure to the conditions which caused the disease.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to overcome another absurdity in the clause. We cannot match the Minister's words and demeanour in responding to our arguments. He gave us a clue to his attitude in an earlier sitting when he confessed that some years ago he played Lady Macbeth, no doubt successfully. I am sure that the Minister dons the motley in Committee, as he discusses the amendments with apparent sincerity and knowledge but shows such a complete dislocation with reality that I wonder whether he is talking about other amendments or another Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals mainly with industrial disease and with claims for which only partial compensation can be made. For the past century, those who do the damage—the firms involved—	<i>[Interruption].</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I know that it is getting late and that we are tired and hungry, but if we listen to the hon. Member who is speaking we will get on much better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. McWilliam. The culprit firms usually perpetrate damage out of malice, greed or ignorance. There is always a great gap between an offence and its results and a lag in our scientific knowledge. This is true in every case from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>860</span>
match girls who suffered in the last century to people who recently worked with asbestos or who paint luminous watches today. Thirty years ago people in laboratories used chemical reagents such as carbon tetrachloride and benzine as degreasing agents in fume cupboards and developed cancers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been permissive with noise in factories and only relatively recently have we recognised industrial deafness. Most recently we have discovered the harm caused by the family of dioxins and dibenzofurons. We still know little about them, except that they cause great damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many claims for industrial disease the defendants and even their insurance companies cannot be traced. Often more than one employer is involved and at least one has gone out of business. There may be no record of an employer's liability or of who his insurers were. In these cases it may not be possible for a victim to obtain full compensation. If any companies are left to claim against, compensation is frequently apportioned between defendants and insurance companies according to the periods of negligent exposure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these cases the clause imposes a monumental unfairness as it would require the full amount of benefits to be deducted from the partial compensation paid. Similar considerations arise where a victim has contributed in part to his injuries by his negligence, and these are referred to in the next amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the cases that I describe the victim is not responsible for circumstances that merit no less than full compensation. He has had no influence or control. The Association of British Insurers
	<br><blockquote><p>"has suggested to the DSS that it would be fair to the victims if some way could be found of reducing the amount of benefit to be recouped in line with the amount of compensation to be received."</p></blockquote>
No proposal could be more modest or reasonable than the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said, the amendment would affect cases arising from industrial diseases and would limit the amount of benefit that could be recouped to the proportion of the entire period of exposure to the disease for which an individual compensator is responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industrial diseases can take several years to develop and more than one employer can be responsible. In some cases, one or more of those employers may no longer exist and the remainder can be held responsible for only a proportion of the total damages. Of course I accept that the victim's compensation will correspondingly be reduced in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment proposes that if only three fifths of the compensators are available to give compensation, only three fifths of the total benefit will be recouped. There are two facts that the hon. Gentleman should bear in mind in discussing this. First, the amount of compensation will be reduced if one or more of the compensators no longer exists, and that will happen whether or not the benefits are recouped. Secondly, the individual concerned will have received all the benefits over the period of time that we are seeking to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0497">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>861</span>
recoup under the legislation, and the effect of recoupment will not leave him in a worse position than he would otherwise have been because he will have had those benefits in full. I accept that a person will receive a reduced amount of the total compensation, but that will not substantially alter his position because he will have had those benefits in full in a sense as partial compensation for the injury he has suffered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not our understanding of the effect of the clause. If the Minister can give an assurance that the Bill does not require—when the full amount of benefits are not paid—compensation to be demanded on the full account, I shall be happy to withdraw the amendment. But my advice is that that is not the position. However, in the circumstances, perhaps it will be wise for us to withdraw the amendment now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
