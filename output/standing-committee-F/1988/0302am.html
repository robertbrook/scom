	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 263, in page 13, line 24, at end insert
	<br><q><p>"less any amount by which the compensation payment would have been greater but for the contributory negligence of the victim."</p></q>
With this amendment, we deal with contributory negligence—probably the most fundamental flaw of the clause. This complication seems to have been disregarded. If the social security system or damages for personal injury alone could be relied on to provide full financial compensation, there would be no objection to setting off one against the other. Would that life were that simple, and that the victim would still be left with full compensation. However, unfortunately that is not the case. The only circumstances in which full compensation is, or ought to be, paid by the person responsible for the injury is where the victim was in no way to blame. In all other cases, compensation is reduced in proportion to the degree of blame attaching to the victim. Those are not uncommon cases. Even when the victim was not to blame, a system of horse trading comes into operation. As the Minister reminded us, most cases are settled out of court. The risk that the court might find contributory negligence is one factor that is taken into account in the negotiations—although it may not be precisely spelt out—to decide the acceptable settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some studies reinforce the view that many settlements take into account contributory negligence and the possibility that it might have been a factor, had the case gone to court. The authors of a study of injury victims undertaken by the centre for socio-legal studies at Oxford quoted in last year's report by the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council found that:
	<br><q><p>"the full amount which a court would be likely to award, if 'full' liability were established against the defendant, is heavily discounted in an out-of-court settlement in order to take account of all the uncertainties facing the plaintiff."</p></q>
Both the Pearson report and the Oxford study found that contributory negligence was taken into account in up to half of all settlements and awards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, social security benefits are fundamentally different from compensation awards, and are paid on the assumption of a no-fault basis. The underlining assumption is that, because nobody would deliberately bring about their own injury, negligence is an insurable risk. That has always been the basis of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>864</span>
payments of social security benefits. However, those benefits seldom—probably never—provide full compensation, since the basis on which they are calculated is that of meeting the needs, rather than of compensating for losses. Even on that basis, they are inadequate. They certainly do not cover the full range of injuries, loss of amenity and other headings taken into account when compensation is assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the only way in which a victim can be fully compensated—to the extent that money can compensate for the injuries suffered—is by a combination of benefits that meet his needs, and compensation payments that accounts for all the other headings. That system—setting off all the benefits against compensation payments—removes any possibility of full compensation. The unfairness of the proposal can be seen if we have a look at three hypothetical cases, in each of which the deductible benefits amount to half the amount that would be received as a compensation payment if there was no contributory negligence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.35 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first case, no contributory negligence is involved and the victim receives full compensation, but has to repay all his or her benefits. In the second case, if there is a 50 per cent. deduction for contributory negligence, the victim receives 50 per cent. compensation, all of which must be paid to the DSS in repayment for benefits received. In the third case, the victim was solely to blame and does not have to repay any benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are creating a curious world based on the strange morality that the innocent should be punished, and the guilty should be rewarded. In creating new legislation, and trying to remove an injustice, the Government are falling into an old trap of creating a different injustice. Punishing the innocent is not unknown. Last night, after the debate on Welsh affairs, Welsh Members of Parliament and their guests were moved to sing a well-known Welsh hymn which is addressed "To Everyone Who is Faithful"—"I bob un sy'n Ffyddlon". The second verse begins, "Llnoedd Duw a Satan", which means "The forces of God and Satan". That was inspired by the forces of representing a lower value of good that were arranged in the Chamber. It is a peculiarly Herodic idea of morality to reward the guilty and punish the innocent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those three examples show that the more innocent the victims, the less help they will get from the social security system. The Confederation of British Industry and everyone who commented on the unfortunate proposals, opposed them. The Confederation of British Industry briefed honourable Members on Second Reading. It said that victims
	<br><q><p>"will lose all specified benefits if they are injured by the fault of another driver or their employer.…By contrast, those who suffer injury from their own fault or from no-one's fault will continue to be able to receive their full benefits."</p></q>
The Association of British Insurers also produced a striking example. As with widows, the Government have created traps for themselves. By defective thought processes, and because of malicious forces in their party, they have produced a system of social
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0501">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>865</span>
security so harsh and punitive that it is becoming unenforceable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have quoted at some length my embarrassment theory of political action, which produces payments such as blush money. We shall see other examples of that if the clause comes into effect. The welcome about-turn on widows' benefit in the past 24 hours shows that although the Government thought that their actions were reasonable, their obvious unfairness was so unpopular, and enraged the public to such an extent, that the Government have been forced into an humiliating climbdown.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday, cases from Cornwall received some brief publicity. Families with severely disabled children have been asked to repay attendance allowances paid out between 1979 and 1985 because of a technicality and a misunderstanding. The defence that the families would use—that they used due diligence in making claims—was abolished in 1987.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.40 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The retrospective use of that power is widely seen as grossly unjust, and was portrayed as such by the media in the south-west last night. If the Bill is to proceed, the Government will be in similar position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whenever they seem to be floundering in a sea of chaos of their own creation, we try to offer them a lifeline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A vivid example of the anomaly that would be created was illustrated by the Association of British Insurers in its Second Reading brief, which said:
	<br><q><p>"Someone who is entirely responsible for his own injury (for example, by driving negligently or through drug or alcohol abuse)"—</p></q>
a common experience—
	<br><q><p>"will be entitled to retain his full benefit and not make any refund to the DSS. Where somebody's injury was caused partly or entirely by another person, the injured person will be required to refund his benefit to the DSS in full."</p></q>
The Bill will allow a drunken driver responsible for his own injuries to retain his benefit in full while other people injured as a result of his drunkeness must refund all their benefits to the DSS—the innocent punished, the guilty rewarded. That is not an accidental effect of the formula chosen by the Government for calculating the amount of benefits to be repaid. However the calculation is made, it is inevitable that those who receive compensation will be affected, while those who are wholly to blame for their injuries will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A similar criticism could be made of the present system, under which 50 per cent. of certain benefits are deducted in calculating the damages awarded. Under this system, however, the deduction is made before taking account of the degree of contributory negligence. Thus, if only 50 per cent. of damages are awarded, the deduction for social security benefits is automatically halved. Under the Govt's proposals, that would no longer happen. Not only would all of the benefits be deducted, but there would be no proportionate reduction where the damages award was less than 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>866</span>
The amendment would ensure that the victim is allowed to keep as much of his benefits as is necessary to replace the compensation lost because of the contributory negligence factor. Where there is no contributory negligence, all of the benifits would be recovered. If, for example, the damages awarded were reduced by £10,000 because of contributory negligence, the first £10,000 of benefit would be protected and only benefits above that amount would be repayable. Deductions would be made only where there could otherwise be an element of double compensation. That is the heart of the injustice that the Government are trying to avoid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the amendment will be seen to avoid the problem of double compensation, which is the Government's main inspiration for the clause. The amendment alone will not resolve the difficulties that we have identified and further amendments will be needed to lay down rules for calculating the amount of benefits to be protected where the degree of contributory negligence cannot be ascertained from the court order. That is an uncertain area because the precise element of contributory negligence that is calculated is rarely taken into account or spelt out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the Bill is enacted, we may find that it is necessary to identify the components of any compensation payment far more precisely. We hope that the Minister will acknowledge that the Government are creating a fresh anomaly, which amendment No. 263 would help to correct. We hope that he will accept the amendment, and perhaps go along with us in suggesting further constructive amendments to remove the anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister For Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will need no persuading, as we tackle clause 18, of the complicated nature of the interaction between benefit and compensation payments. In particular, we have already established that 99 per cent. of compensation payments are not made as a result of a court of law decision. Furthermore, the vast majority of settlements make no reference to contributory negligence. In many cases, there is no admission of liability - the settlement is agreed and the money paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we followed the path suggested by the honourable Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), who concentrated entirely on the treatment of benefits rather than on the overall financial impact on the individuals concerned, and if recovery of benefits was in inverse proportion to the element of contributory negligence on the part of the injured person, that would add substantial extra complication to the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the honourable Gentleman is suggesting that benefits should be used to make up any reduction in the compensation that results from contributory negligence. We would prefer the benefits and compensation to be, in a sense, complementary. If a £4,000 payment is reduced to £2,000 because of contributory negligence, and £1,000 has already been paid in benefits, the whole of the £1,000 should be recovered so that the injured person receives the re-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>867</span>
maining £1,000 in compensation. The injured person will thus have received the total of £2,000 in benefits and compensation. Any other calculation would leave the person who is more to blame for his injuries financially better off by having a smaller proportion of his compensation deducted in respect of the benefits that he has received. For instance, someone who was 95 per cent. to blame could have only 5 per cent. of his benefits deducted. That would be a perverse result of the honourable Gentleman's suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give an example of the perverse result way that the suggested system would operate. Let us consider a case where the total compensation awarded or agreed amounted to £10,000 and benefits of £2,000 had been paid to the injured party. Fifty per cent. negligence had been applied, so £5,000 would be deducted from the £10,000, less the benefits paid of £2,000. In that case, compensator would pay £3,000 to the victim, who would have received £2,000 in benefit, so the total compensation would amount to £5,000, which is precisely 50 per cent. of the compensation which had been agreed or awarded. I shall go through the mathematics if necessary, but on the same basis, if we follow the line taken by the amendment, the person would end up with £6,000, rather than £5,000. He would be over-compensated in total and the taxpayer would have to make up the difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot recommend the amendment to the Committee, because its effects would be complicated and perverse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If anything was perverse, it was the Minister's answer. He did not respond to my point that, although it is not always apparent in the final outcome, in up to half of all settlemtns and awards, according to the Pearson report - on which much Goverment thinking on the issue is based - an the Oxford study, it is anticipated that some negligence will be involved in out of court settlements. That is a major factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister persists in the belief, illustrated by a comment that has been made by the honourable Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire), that it is the poor taxpayer who has to pay and we are all involved in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are talking about an insurance scheme on which the Government have reneged in many ways, such as in the case of the widows who were mentioned earlier, even though people think that they have a deal with that scheme. I have brought to the attention of the Minister the case of a couple who had both worked all their lives. Tragically, the husband died a matter of days before the wife's 45th birthday and she was cheated out of a deal or a contract that had been understood to exist by the husband and the wife throughout their working lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government tried to change that contract because of the poor taxpayer, but national insurance should be seen as an insurance process. We notice that the Government make a great distinction between private insurance and national insurance. There is no problem. They are not concerned about double compensation there. The Minister has failed to take up the example, and I challenge him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>868</span>
The case quoted by both the Association of British Insurers - which represents the professionals - and the Confederation of British Industry graphically spelled out what might happen where a drunken driver would in effect be rewarded - that is he would not suffer the loss - and if it were decided that the pedestrian, the injured party, was partly to blame for his injuries, he would suffer. That enormous and obvious injustice has also been pointed out to the Government by the Opposition and many other groups
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reconsider, because in the clause the Government are trying to mix oil with water - to mix compensation and national insurance benefits when they cannot be mixed because they do not serve the same ends. National insurance is there to prop people up, to provide them with a basis for continuing to live, whereas compensation is designed to provide people with money, as far as money can compensate someone for loss of sight, loss of amenities and other pain and injury.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will create a major new injustice. A day will come when we shall stand here speaking of cases much like the ones we have mentioned where those who are guilty find themselves in pocket and those who are guiltless suffer loss of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister speaks in his own defence - which I hope he will - I should like to echo the remarks of my honourable Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the Minister perverted - to use his own word - my honourable Friend's argument was extraordinary. The Minister argued that there is something wrong with a system in which someone who is 95 per cent to blame may receive their full DSS benefits, but that is precisely what happens with person who is 100 per cent to blame, as my honourable Friend has just very ably pointed out. The Minister is completely disregarding the way in which the system will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said also that it was wrong to suppose that benefits might be used to make up what had been lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must emphasise, that that is only a possibility, because often the Minister strays away from the practicalities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have done under previous clauses, we are talking not about whether contributory negligence exists or whether it could be proved in the court, but about the way in which those dealing with such cases -the insurers, the solicitors for the victim, the employers or whoever - have to assess the risk of contributory negligence being adjudged and decide what level of compensation should be accepted on that basis. On the basis of such theoretical matters, the Minister is saying that people should lose 100 per cent of their DSS benefits. He said that benefits were complementary, and that was why it was wrong for them to be used to make up for what someone might have lost in the original adjudication between the various parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>869</span>
However, the Government's whole argument, and the main point of the clause, is not that benefits are complementary but that benefits and the compensation system are double compensation. The Minister is saying that he refuses to take account of how contributory negligence lowers the level of damages that might be awarded. He is saying that, to avoid the risk of double compensation, the Government will happily allow compensation to be doubly reduced, so that people may lose out twice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alarming aspect of this is that, if the Government refuse to listen, the proposal will not only cause but be seen to cause great injustice. All the reports from different bodies show that the possibility of a judgement of contributory negligence being made substantially lowers the damages awarded in many cases. The Minister is saying, "Do not bother us with that. We don't care whether a person is unjustly losing out, but only about whether we get our pound of flesh." That is consistent with the Government's approach, but it is not justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) suggested that the impact of the imperfect working of the compensation payment system - which is largely arranged informally rather than through the courts - should be made up by the benefits system. That was not what Beveridge said when he addressed the question, and his principles should guide our consideration the clause. If a person suffers injury and needs the support of the state through the benefit system, those benefits should be paid promptly to the person, even though he or she may have an alternative method of being compensated for those injuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when that compensation comes to be paid, it is not the Government's job to decide the level of compensation. The decision may be reached informally, but a legal process determines the amount to which a person is entitled in compensation for the injury that he has suffered as a result of someone else's actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course it is true that if no compensation is paid, there is no question of the benefits of that person being withdrawn. That must be right. The principle of Beveridge is clear. If that alternative compensation is eventually paid, from that should be deducted the amount of benefit that has already been paid in the interim by the state to the person who has suffered that loss. The amendment would undermine that sound principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The clause will cause inordinate delays because of the process involved in adjusting claims. Some 95 per cent. of the settlements that I dealt with as a provincial solicitor involved compromise settlements. The machinery in the clause and the related schedule will cause great difficulties for practitioners in the field, as well as for the victims who will be denied the advantages of the existing system. The Government have not taken that properly into account. The amendement is sensible and deals with some of those difficulties. The Government have made no case for the clause.

Because of his absence from the Committee, he will have been unaware that Conservative Back Benchers refer to themselves as battery hens. We learnt on Tuesday of the contrast between the way that the two sides of the House regard hens. My honourable Friends the Members for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn), for Preston (Mrs. Wise) and for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) do not slaughter their hens when they become barren but capital punishment awaits the hens of Conservative Members as a reward for their long service as egg layers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister has not dealt with the point about the enormous proportion of claims where compromise settlements are made. The honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshrie said that in his practical experience, that happens in 95 per cent. of cases. The Minister quoted from guru Beveridge on the subject and made a rather different point from the one that we are making. Perhaps the generous thing to do would be to withdraw the amendment so that the Minister's remarks can be read with astonishment by all those neutral and disinterested bodies which have made applications and do not want to see their affairs turned into new, freshly minted Government chaos by the clause. Therefore, we shall give the Government an opportunity to have a rethink about the problems that they will create. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Government amendment No. 195, in page 13, line 25, leave out paragraph (b) and insert—

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following: amendement (a) thereto, in Line 1, after second "to", insert "90 per cent. of.

	<br><q><p>"or the amount which was required to be deducted under subsection (l)(a) above, whichever is less".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 195 is a technical amendment to make it clear that a compensator must pay the Secretary of State, whether or not he makes the deduction from the compensation payment. There is no change in policy but it removes some slight ambiguity and ensures consistency with the wording of schedule 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment (a) and amendment No. 265 relate to the costs that will be imposed on various groups which deal with the claims. In appendix 3 to the Touche Ross report, it is estimated that the annual administration costs that insurance companies would have incurred in recouping benefits of £57.5 million for the DSS in 1987 would have been some £6 million, which is about 10.5 per cent. of the sums recovered. In addition, Touche Ross recognised that setting up new systems or adjusting existing systems to handle benefit recovery would involve companies in capital expenditure. In view of those additional costs, the Association of British Insurers considered that the DSS should reimburse insurance companies by a discount on beenfits recouped of, say, 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In tabling the amendments, we are asking whether the Government are prepared to recognise the extra costs that they are imposing on industry. This is the Government who have bored us stiff for the past 10 years with a lot of cant about lifing the burdens on business and releasing the entrepreneur and so on. This gives the Government an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides that only 90 per cent. of the amount deducted from the compensation payment would be handed over to the Department, the other 10 per cent. being retained by the compensator. That would apply whether or not the compensator was an insurance company. The extra adminstrative burden might be rather more for those who are not insurance companies. At least insurance companies have a large number of claims to deal with and might be expected to have a lower expense ratio. Therefore, we argue that this provision should apply more widely than jsut to insurance companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike most Government proposals, our amendment would make no difference to the victim. It would not reduce the money available to the victim, nor would it mean a further deduction from the compensation payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would simply mean that the Department of Social Security would have to recognise the increased costs that will fall on the insurance companies. The amendment would not change the law in a way that would benefit the DSS and no one else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 265 relates to clause 18(2), which states:
	<br><q><p>"Any right of the intended recipient to receive the compensation payment in question shall be regarded as satisfied to the extent of the amount certified in the certificate of deduction."</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0505">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>873</span>
As we understand it, that means that if the compensator has deducted a given sum from the compensation payment for payment to the DSS, the compensation claim is to be treated as satisfied to the extent of the amount deducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That could be unfair to the victim, for two reasons. First, the compensator may have deducted too much. Amendment No. 265 would ensure that if too much has been deducted, the victim should remain entitled to the amount of the over-deduction. Secondly, the compensator may, whether intentionally or not, issue a deduction certificate for more than the amount deducted. If so, the claim should be treated as satisfied only to the extent of the amount deducted. Amendment No. 265 would provide that if the amount certified in the deduction certificate is more than the amount which should have been deducted, only the latter amount should be regarded as part of the compensation payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These may be minor, technical matters in the context of the clause, as a whole, but they are nevertheless important, and I should be interested in the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Touche Ross estimated in its report the extra cost that would accrue to employers, motorists and others with a public liability. There is scope for debate about the likely total costs involved. That would depend, most obviously, on the cut-off point above which the provision in the clause would come into effect. However, I recognise that there will be extra costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot recommend that the Committee accepts amendment (a) as it stands. However, as we are anxious to limit the rise in premiums which might otherwise be inevitable, I give an undertaking that we shall introduce an amendment that will be aimed at helping to meet compensators' administrative costs by a different method from the one suggested in amendment (a).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 265, there is no reason to suppose that compensators will try to deduct more from a compensation payment than they are required to pay to the Secretary of State, but I understand the safeguard that the honourable Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) is trying to provide for the victims. On first advice, it seems that the point is already covered in the definition in clause 18(3), as the certificate of deduction must specify the amount that has been deducted and paid to the Secretary of State. I shall examine carefully what the honourable Lady has said and consider whether we should table a further amendment to achieve her aim. I hope that the honourable Lady is satisfied with that assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I have taken particular heed of his remarks about meeting compensators' costs and understand that the Department will look for some way to do that. We simply wanted to raise the issue; we would not necessarily propose what is contained in amendment (a) and amendment No. 265.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Department will consult the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>874</span>
compensator about the most sensible method. I use the word "consult" with some hesitation, because earlier discussions showed that the last time that the Department consulted on proposals, it did not have to take any heed of what was said. Nevertheless, we hope that on this occasion the Department will listen to proposals about the most practical method of dealing with difficulties. We are grateful that the Government recognise that such difficulties exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the Minister's point about at what level of payment the cut-off point will affect the administration costs. As there are further amendments on the issue which we shall debate later, I shall not dwell on it at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also grateful to the Minister for agreeing to examine the Bill's drafting to try to deal with the second problem that we identified about possible inaccurate deductions. Again, we shall come later to amendments to schedule 2 which examine the way that the schedule, as well as the clause, is phrased. That is another issue which we might explore further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to give the honourable Lady the assurance that she is seeking. There is a distinction to be drawn between having discussions with those interested parties who are opposed to the principles inherent in the clause and ensuring that we have sensible and constructive discussions with them about the method of dealing with the honourable Lady's point. I give her the undertaking that we shall consult those parties on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the Minister. I should hate to say anything that might be construed as criticism. However, an interesting new definition of "consultation" has emerged from the Minister's remarks. It is as if he is saying to those who are consulted, "As long as we do not disagree with you, we shall listen to you. Otherwise, you can forget it." I know that that is not what the Minister said, and I do not wish to be ungracious to him, but I have noted with some amusement that that could be read into his words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 267 and 271 are, as I think the Minister will agree, quite important amendments to clause 18, about which we are not happy. Amendment No. 267 would insert in the clause the words:
	<br><q><p>"but shall not include unemployment benefit or income support to which entitlement is dependent on availability for employment".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0506">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>875</span>
This is an important amendment and I hope that the Minister will understand why we tabled it. The amount to be deducted from the compensation payment is the gross amount of any relevant benefits paid, or likely to be paid, in respect of that accident, injury or disease. Clause 18(3) defines relevant benefits as
	<br><q><p>"any benefit under—(a) the Social Security Acts 1975 to 1988, or (b) the Old Cases Act"</p></q>
as may be prescribed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the notes on clauses, which the Department helpfully sent to all Committee members, one might have expected an explanation of how the Government intended to use this regulation-making power and precisely which benefits were to be repayable. However, the notes on clause do not give such an explanation. Therefore amendment No. 267 would give some protection to those on unemployment benefit or income support whose entitlement is dependent on availability for employment. They have to be available for employment, if they are entitled to those benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment benefit and income support paid in lieu of, or in supplementation of, unemployment benefit should not be repayable. It is important to draw a distinction between someone who has suffered losing work through an injury and someone who has lost work because he has been made redundant—through his factory closing, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would exclude unemployment benefit and income support for unemployed people from the definition of "relevant benefits", as defined in the Old Cases Act and the existing social security legislation. In his reply, I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to explain which benefits would be repayable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 271 would add to line 13 of page 15 of the Bill the words:
	<br><q><p>"any payment made under a contract of employment."</p></q>
The definition of "compensation payment" under clause 18(3) is
	<br><q><p>"any payment falling to be made (whether voluntarily, or in pursuance of a court order or an agreement, or otherwise) … by or on behalf of a person who is, or is alleged to be, liable to any extent in respect of that accident, injury of disease, but does not include benefit or an exempt payment".</p></q>
At first sight, it would appear that accidents at work—where compensation is also paid by the plaintiffs employer—contractual payments' sick pay, ill-health pensions and lump sums under a contractor's scheme would all fall within the definition. Accordingly, they could not be paid to the plaintiff until the entire benefit likely to be received up to the date of a judgment or settlement had been paid to the Secretary of State. The Law Society says that that cannot be intended and that such contractual payments should be added to the list of exempt payments. I suspect that the Department has made a drafting error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If payments under contracts of employment were added to the list of exempt payments, they could continue to be paid. A similar problem could arise
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>876</span>
with ex gratia payments by an employer. I hope that the Minister is prepared to consider exempting them as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will set my mind at rest by saying that the Government do not intend to prevent people from receiving such benefits as ex gratia and contractual payments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First may I clarify those benefits which will not be recoverable once the Bill reaches the statute book and the regulations come into force? The list is as follows: retirement pension, widows' benefit, invalid care allowance, guardians' allowance, war pension benefit, housing benefit, child benefit, maternity benefit and statutory maternity pay. The characteristic that links those benefits is that they do not relate to injury, however defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 267 concerns unemployment benefit. If unemployment is created as a result of an accident and unemployment benefit is paid, it would be wrong to pay compensation; that would amount to double compensation. If someone was already unemployed and then suffered an accident for which he received compensation, unemployment pay would not be recoverable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister is saying. If someone is unemployed for some other reason and has received compensation for a previous injury, illness or disease, his unemployment benefit would not be affected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can agree with the honourable Gentleman. For unemployment pay to be recoverable, the compensation must relate to the injury or disease that created the need for the unemployment pay. In other circumstances, the provision would not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Someone who suffers and injury at work for which he claims compensation may be unemployed briefly as a result of the injury. For example, a bus driver may have to give up his job because of an injury through driving. If he subsequently obtains an office job loses that job, perhaps through redundancy, and becomes unemployed, the second period of unemployment benefit would be through loss of the second job and would be unaffected by the compensation payment for the first accident. Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, exactly. I am discussing unemployment benefit which is paid as a direct result of the injury or disease that leads to the compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful to clarify the benefits affected. Will sickness benefit, statutory sick pay, invalidity benefit, severe disablement allowance, disablement benefit, reduced earnings allowance, retirement allowance, attendance allowance, constant attendance allowance and mobility allowance be affected?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that unemployment benefit will be affected, insofar as it relates to the accident. That is outrageous, but we shall come back to that point shortly. Who will decide—and how will they decide—whether unemployment is directly

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>877</span>
as a result of accident or injury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In effect, that matter is already dealt with under the present arrangements. Compensators and victims must decide. We shall let victims know at the earliest stage which benefits we intend to recoup. Victims would be able to question the inclusion of any benefit if they do not agree that it was paid as a consequence of their injury and they are not claiming compensation for it. I envisage no difficulty over the continuation of that arrangement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not our intention to recoup payment from occupational sick pay or permanent health payments that an employer is contracted to provide in the event of incapacity. Therefore I accept totally the spirit of amendment No. 271. We have a regulation-making power under subsection (5). If honourable Members will agree not to press the amendment, we shall consider the best form of words to use. I give an absolute assurance that we shall include such payments in the regulations that we make in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will income support as well as unemployment benefit be considered a relevant benefit? Can basic income support benefit—whether it is unemployment benefit, because contributions have been paid, or income support, because there are insufficient contributions—be clawed back if it is considered in some way to be in respect of the accident, injury or disease?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would be wrong. The Minister says that it is under consideration now, but we are confused. Some element of benefit may be deducted under one piece of legislation and different elements of benefit may be deducted under other legislation. If the Government have their way, 100 per cent. of benefits could be deducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it did not matter that unemployment benefit or income support could be deducted, because the victims would be informed as soon as possible and they could let the DSS know. The Government are creating yet more uncertainty, harassment and trauma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is discussing people disabled by accidents, injuries or diseases to the extent that they are not in work, or able to work. Any compensation paid to such people may jeopardise their disability benefits, which are paid not as an element of compensation but as recognition of the needs and costs of disabled people. The question of whether disability benefits do so adequately is another matter. Not only may disability benefits be lost but unemployment benefit or income support may be deducted. Those people are already out of work, waiting to hear from insurers, employers and compensators. They will be getting all sorts of confusing and difficult-to-follow advice. Those people are already extremely sick or injured but they will be casually told by the Department that they may lose 100 per cent. of the income that they receive from benefit. That is horrendous. It will add considerably to the trauma, difficulties and ill health of those affected. The Government should seriously reconsider the proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the tone of voice of the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) when he read out the list of benefits affected, I assume that he finds it as appalling as I that that range of benefits can be lost, and their value repaid to the Department. Those benefits are already inadequate for individual needs. To claw back even the basic income benefits will put victims in an invidious position and will result in an outrageous increase in pressure on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse and support my honourable Friend's comments. I thank the Minister for clarifying the intention behind the clause and for accepting the spirit of amendment No. 271.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 267 highlights an injustice. My earlier analogy was of a busdriver losing his job through an accident, receiving unemployment benefit for three months while his claim is assessed, then getting an office job but losing it through no fault of his own. The first period of unemployment benefit would be lost from any compensation paid because of the accident. The second period would be unaffected, because it is caused by something separate from the accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A woman working in the school meals service may have a serious accident in the school kitchen. That happens frequently. I have experience of that from my previous job as a National Union of Public Employees organiser, dealing with school meals workers. That woman may find it difficult to get any other job because her skills may be confined to school meals work. If full-time workers suffer severe burns because of an accident they will receive unemployment benefit, but they will lose all that benefit when compensation is finally paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will operate arbitrarily. Compensation is on a scale commensurate with the injury, harm or hurt to a person. An accident victim who succeeds in getting another job could get full compensation for the injury loss because of the accident and lose only a short period of unemployment benefit, while the school meals woman would lose all her unemployment benefit if she were unemployed for a much longer period because of the accident. I do not know whether it is intended, but there is something wholly arbitrary about the clause. It is appalling that where people have become unemployed as a result of an accident at work—that is increasingly a problem, particularly in the building industry and certainly in my area—they are given the necessary benefits, which are then taken away from them when a compensation payment is made, so there is a charge against the compensation payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding of compensation payments resulting from injury, illness and so on received at work is that a person is being compensated for the hurt that he or she has suffered. If someone loses an arm in an industrial accident, he or she is compensated for the loss of that arm. I see it as a double jeopardy—to use the Minister's words—on people who have suffered accidents if subsequently benefit is deducted from the compensation paid on the accident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that compensation often takes such a long time to come through, many of our constituents will have exhausted their right to unemployment benefit and will then be on income support. Will the Government try to recoup benefit paid for that time? It is important that people know that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a second comment, which my honourable Friend might like to emphasise to the Minister. When my honourable Friend was explaining what I, and most people on the back of the omnibus going to Clapham common, understand compensation payments to be about, the Minister shook his head in disagreement. I hope that when the Minister replies he will tell my honourable Friend, myself, and-all Opposition Members what has so changed the Government's thinking on what most of us understand to be the interpretation of compensation—so much so, that they are changing the rules for benefit eligiblity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My honourable Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) has made two excellent points, and I hope that the Minister will answer them when he replies to the debate. I shall deal first with my honourable Friend's second point and the question of what is compensation. I, too, saw the Minister shake his head but I thought that perhaps he had an itch in his ear or something like that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Member for Roxburgh an Berwickshire might be able to answer better than I can, because he is a lawyer with vast experience of this. Compensation might well include something other than compensation for the loss of an arm or leg. Expenses, loss of earnings, long-term disability, pain and suffering as a result of the accident might all be factors to be included. I was shaking my head to say that compensation, however it might be understood by the person on the Clapham omnibus, would not be restricted simply to the example that was given by the honourable Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for intervening. I am not sure whether he has clarified anything; he may have made things rather worse. I do not talk to people on the Clapham omnibus because I never travel to Clapham if I can avoid it. I travel on the No. 29 bus from Finsbury Park. People on the No. 29 bus are very clear about the matter—probably more clear about it than those who travel to Clapham. They are of the opinion that if someone is paid compensation for an injury—I have represented people at industrial injuries tribunals and have been involved in such negotiations—that person receives compensation for the hurt and suffering resulting from an accident. One receives compensation as a result of the damage that may have been suffered to one's career expectations in the long run and for the hurt that is suffered in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, a person will become unemployed and receive unemployment benefit for a period of up to six months. All of that could be recouped, even though the accident for which that person has been paid compensation was no fault of her or his own. I find it wholly unfair that someone on unemployment benefit, who is not doing particularly well anyway and has suffered the trauma of an accident, disease or

industrial illness, should have that benefit taken away. That is a double punishment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be my fault, but I also found it difficult to follow the Minister's answer, all the more so because he said that compensation might include payments for, for example, elements of pain, suffering and distress. The Government propose to ignore that by resisting all suggestions that clawback should be only from relevant damages. So someone might receive compensation for pain suffering and distress and the Department could take the whole of it back.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What my honourable Friend has said is perfectly true. When the Minister replies to the contributions of the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire and of my honourable Friends the Members for Birkenhead and for Derby, South and myself, I hope that he will explain that there is something badly wrong in the drafting of the clause. I cannot believe that it is the Bill's intention doubly to punish people who have already suffered trauma.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to put himself in the position of any of the people in the cases that I have mentioned, and to imagine the trauma of having an industrial injury of such magnitude that one can no longer continue in one's work of particular skill. That does not normally occur to Minister of Parliament, as they can carry on working in some form or another almost irrespective of what degree of injury they have sustained. If someone has a particular skill or job, it is not always easy to go into some form of alternative employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should try to imagine the trauma that people suffer when, as a result of industrial injury, they are unable to carry on with their work. For example, a carpenter who loses an arm in an awful accident with a circular saw suffers great trauma as a result of not being able to continue work, and feels that he has no other contribution to make and nothing else to do. He spends months and months arguing about possible compensation claims, knowing all the time that when the compensation comes through, the small amount of money that has kept him and his family going on unemployment benefit during that period is taken off it. I cannot believe that that is the intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my honourable Friend spend some time drawing attention to the nature of the Minister's recent intervention, when he called on the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, and failed to get the support he wanted? He failed to answer the main point, which is: why are the Government changing the rules at this time? If we put the matter to a vote on the No. 29 bus, most people travelling on it would have a clear view that the Government aim to cut benefits, and that this is another measure with that aim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I pay great heed to those who travel on the No. 29 bus, as they all live in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

not aware that the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire was a lawyer, but I now understand him. He was trying to elicit from the Minister exactly what benefits would be at stake in the matter, and it was helpful of him to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compensation in clause 18 includes the cost of a obtaining compensation. Are we now to assume that benefits will also be recovered from legal costs and the like? Some people are represented by trade unions, which in a sense are a kind of insurance policy, as the union underwrites the legal costs of obtaining compensation, irrespective of the success of the claim and without change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a roadsweeper is knocked down by a passing car and suffers serious injury, the union takes up his case and may obtain for him substantial damages of several thousand pounds, for which it deducts no legal costs. Tragically, some people have not experienced the benefits of joining a trade union, so they do not receive the free legal support that is available elsewhere and spend a great deal of money in pursuing perfectly just claims for compensation. That will cost them a lot of money, which again would be removed from the benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same happens with road accidents. A person whose son had suffered a serious motor cycle accident came to see me. There was a long argument about whose fault it was. When that was resolved and compensation was discussed, the lawyer gently pointed out that if they went on much longer with the case, there would be negative compensation, because his bills would be greater than the compensation that could possibly be obtained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to explain what is meant by the provision, as it is wholly wrong. I am sure that I am not alone in that belief, and that those on the No. 29 bus, and on every other bus in London, are united on the issue. Compensation should be real compensation for the injury suffered, and not some double jeopardy of taking back benefits aftewards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my honourable Friend share my worry over whether the cost of legal representation will be taken into account? Even if the Minister says that it will not, we know perfectly well that it will go on the list as a provision to be added to the next Social Security Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am hoping that we shall have a six-month gap between the end of this Social Security Bill and the start of the next. All of us need a period of calm reflection. We may return for another Social Security Bill in the autumn. I wish it were possible for roles to be reversed and sides changed, and for my honourable Friend the Member for Derby, South to the Minister. I hope that this Member will not remove those charges in the way in which my honourable Friend the Member for Birkenhead suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recommend that the honourable Member for Islington, North reads the debate on our previous sitting, in which a specific amendment on costs was discussed. The principle underlying the clause is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>882</span>
simple: it is that a person should not be doubly compensated for an injury or incident, both by the benefit system and by any compensation he may ultimately receive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person loses his or her job as a direct result of an accident, injury or diseased and eventually receives compensation, it is right fot the consequential benefit payments to be recovered from the compensation. I know that Opposition Minister do not agree with it, but that is a priniciple underliend by Beveridge. However, we are not changing eligibility to benefit in the first place. We agree that the person should receive that because of his or her immediate needs. However, when he or she receives compensation in due course, the Secretary of State should be able to recover the benefits paid in the interim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) asked why the Government were changing the rules, but we are not. Courts have ruled that under the existing system, unemployment benefit, supplementary benefit and income support should be 100 per cent. - not 50 per cent. - offset against any compensation received. Therefore, we are not changing the rules, as this already happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If this has already happened, why is the provision included in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing an amendment that would make such a procedure impossible. In effect, we are saying that this benefit, like the others, would be recoverable. We are changing from offset to recovery. However, under the existing offsetting arrangement, the courts have ruled that income support and unemployment pay should be 100 per cent. offset.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the courts are already ruling that, why are the Government taking a power to make arrangements uniform?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision is included in the Bill because there is a difference between offsetting and recouping.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify that the courts have decided that such benefits should be recouped 100 per cent. because of a previous Act, which provides that deduction should be 100 per cent. rather than 50 per cent., as it is under the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948? Secondly, will the Minister clarify whether housing benefit will be affected in the same way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I read out a list of benefits that will not be recouped and housing benefit was one of them. Case law, developed over the years, has established that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. I am asking the Minister whether that is because the cases being judged were being judged under the Act which envisages 100 per cent. recoupment of the benefits that are recouped. What if the judgment were made under the Act where there is a 50 per cent. recoupment? Is the judgment specifically unemployment benefit and income support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am getting into tricky territory. In 1948, when the 50 per cent. compromise was arrived at and when it was decided not to carry through the principles which Beveridge enunciated, which I have wearied the Committee with on more than one occasion, it was applied to a specific set of benefits. They were listed in the 1948 legislation. As new benefits have come into existence, the courts have ruled on some occasions that the 50 per cent. offset rule should apply and in others that the 100 per cent. offset rule should apply. The courts have ruled that 100 per cent. of the appropriate figure should apply for unemployment benefit, income support and supplementary benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Bill goes through unamended, does the Minsiter expect compensation payments to be increased?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me again weary the Committee with the fact that only 1 per cent. of these cases are ever awarded by courts. Most of them are the result either of a legal process having been started and then aborted and an agreement being reached or of informal arrangement. I have told the Committee several times before that I would expect that the negotiations which take place here would reflect the fact that the law has now changed, but I cannot say what weight of argument the different parties will put on that. The honourable Member for Islington, North referred to horse trading earlier. I am by no means an expert, and perhaps the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshrie (Mr Kirkwood) will correct me, but that may not be too inaccurate and description of what often happens in these cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it is exactly horse trading. A legal representative is appointed for a person who has suffered an injury. He negotiates with the employer and, we hope, both sides reach an agreement and a compensation figure is fixed. The plaintiff always knows that he can go to court, but most negotiations are fixed by reference to case law. That is an expensive process. Employing solicitors to do the negotiation is expensive and seeking counsel's opinion is extremely expensive. While it is settled informally in the sense that there is often no recourse to law itself, it is very much a preliminary to a legal process. The costs can be quite considerable even then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that it will be absolutely clear for the people participating in these negotiations, are we right in saying that the Minister expects that if the Bill goes through unamended those undertaking negotiations, whether informally or in the courts, will take this measure into account and will therefore wish to settle for a higher compensatory or inflationary boosted payment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The honourable Gentleman is leading me into making judgments. It is not my place to do that in my present role. I can make a personal judgment about what may happen but these are complicated matters. They are largely informal with a whole range factors being taken into account. It would be wrong for me to speculate on the particular weight
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>884</span>
that would be put on any one factor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's reply on amendment No. 271. We look forward to the changes. We are not happy about what has happened with amendment No. 267. We believe that there will be a double jeopardy, and a penalty on people who have suffered unfortunate, serious and tragic illnesses and accidents as a result of their employment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We discussed earlier whether deductions should be made only to the relevant heads of damages. The Minsiter suggested that one of the reasons why such a proposal should not be written into the Bill was that it would be difficult to identify. He preferred to run the risk of recouping damages paid as a consequence of pain and suffering rather than leave the damages alone, with the result that the Department got less of its money back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are circumstances in which the different heads of damages and the reasons why particular elements of compensation have been awarded are clearly identified and recorded. That is where cases go to the High Court. We believe that if the Minsiter suggests that that is the sort of judgment that should be made, we should consider whether the operation of the Bill should be limited to those cases where a fair assessment can be made of what benefits should be recouped and against what payment of damages that recoupment should be set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18(3) defines "compensation payment" as
	<br><q><p>"any payment falling to be made (whether voluntarily, or in pursuance of a court order or an agreement, or otherwise)".</p></q>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0511">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>885</span>
We propose to limit the definition to payments made under a High Court order. That has been suggested to us by solicitors who specialise in compensation claims because considerable problems could arise where a compromise out-of-court settlement is reached. We raised the question of contributory negligence in the debate on the amendments moved by honourable Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) and the risks of litigation that occur whether or not there is contributory negligence. There are always risks in litigation. The case could fail completely if liability is in dispute, or if there were a finding of contributory negligence, there would be the risk of how great it might be. None of this is an exact science. There is always a variation in the amount that an individual may be awarded. It is often desirable and prudent and it saves everyone time and money if a compromise settlement can be reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on an earlier amendment, I gave an example of where that might occur. It concerned a person who lost the sight of an eye but had not sustained any loss of earnings. There might be a dispute about whether there is liability and so the question of contributory negligence might also arise. I drew attention then to the fact that the realistic maximum value of that person's claim is £20,000, of which £15,000 is to compensate him for his pain, suffering and loss of amenity. We identified the fact that £5,000 is the customary sum awarded for difficulties that an injured person may have in securing alternative employment. Because of the risks of litigation, it has been argued that that settlement amount should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if someone loses an eye, which is a grave injury, the maximum sum that could be involved is £20,000. Under the Bill, some £8,000 of that will go to the Department, leaving the individual with £12,000. Although the case is settled outside court, no element of the compensation awarded for damages is for future lack of standing in the labour market. The vast bulk of the award is for pain, suffering and loss of amenity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The repayment of benefits to the DSS will inevitably cut into that award, even though the DSS benefits are not awarded as compensation for pain and suffering but merely reflect additional needs that arise from the disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not provide for the amount of benefits to be deducted from the final award to reflect the lower compromise settlement compared to the potential 100 per cent. value of the claim. Moreover, it highlights the difficulty in assessing the percentage upon which the case is settled and the difficulties regarding causation. In this case, we know the basis on which the assessment has been made. Compensation has been sought and, broadly speaking, seems likely to be paid. The basis on which claims are to be settled is often not revealed and the only certain way that it can be known is if a case goes to trial. The court is then obliged to give reasons for its decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although cases may go to county courts where there are no recording facilites, the amendment limits
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>886</span>
the effect of the Bill to cases judged by the High Court, where transcripts of decisions are available and reasons for awarding damages can be clearly identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a precedent for such an approach. In unfair dismissal cases, the Secretary of State can serve a recoupment notice on the employer only where a compensation award has been made by a tribunal. He cannot do so if the case has not gone to court an an agreed settlement has been reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 268 would make it much easier to make proper allowance for contributory negligence in calculating the amount of benefit repayable. It would make a substantial improvement if the Government persist in going ahead with their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 192 raises a different matter, but one of practical importance. It touches on the matters that we raised earlier about the bureaucracy of the structure likely to result from the Government's proposals, about its costs, effects, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, victims may have received no benefits and may never receive them. The Association of British Insurers gives the example of noise-induced hearing loss, which is unfortunately a common industrial disease. In similar cases the Bill will still require the insurance company to ask the Department for a certificate before it can pay compensation, even though there is nothing to certify. That seems to the insurers and to us to be a waste of everybody's time, even the Department's.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 2.1 of the Touche Ross report, where claims settled since 1987 are studied, states that DSS benefits were received only by a minority of those claiming for personal injuries. The results of its investigation for settlements in 1987 were that benefit was claimed in only 14 per cent of personal injury public liability claims, 40 per cent of employers' liability claims—all of which relate to personal injury—and 18 per cent of personal injury motor claims. Out of 14,600 public liability settlements, 94,900 employers' liability settlements, the number of DSS benefit claims would have been 2,044 in cases of public liability, 37,960 in cases of employers' liability and 15,390 in motor cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a total of only 55,394, or just over 28 per cent, so the total number of settlements in which benefit was not claimed was over 70 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Insurance companies have to make literally thousands of inquiries of the DSS. The number of cases where no benefit was claimed was almost 140,000. At least 140,000 inquiries would have had to be made in 1987 in cases where it was known in advance that no benefit would be paid. That is a complete waste of time and resources for both insurance companies and the DSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 192 would exempt the compensator from the requirement to apply for a certificate in a case where he had been informed by the victim's solicitor that no relevant benefit had been or would be received. The amendment places the cost of obtaining that information on the compensator, but that is a better approach to the difficulty than that which is enshrined in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may be able to be more helpful on amendment No. 192 than on amendment No. 268. I have sympathy with the spirit of amendment No. 192. We welcome anything that cuts out unproductive administrative work for both the Department and compensators. I have seen the exemplification of the 5(),(KK) cases a year of occupational deafness which has been forwarded to Committee members by the Association of British Insurers, and we should take a careful note of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the amendment is that it goes rather wider than I want to go, not least because it relates to any case where a victim's solicitor passes on the information that no benefits are paid or are likely to be paid. The solicitor's most likely source of information is the victim. Experience has shown that, when asked, victims are often unsure of the benefits that they might have received in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we are anxious to consult. We have already begun to consult with the private sector on the details of the scheme. There is a panel of people from the insurance industry, the legal profession and the TUC.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our discussions with them we hope to be able to find the right form of words to go into the regulations so that we can be reasonable certain that we pick up only those peopole who are very unlikely to have received benefit, such as the occupational deafness cases. I hope that in those circumstances and in the light of that assurance, the honourable Lady will withdraw the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Lady will not be surprised to hear that I cannot be so forthcoming on amendment No. 268. Of course it is a logical position for her to take from her point of view. Some of the arguments that she advanced are superficially attractive; we heard some of them in discussions on previous amendments. The effect of the amendment would be that the overwhelming majority of payments would not be subject to the scheme that the Government are introducing. It is as close to a wrecking amendment as is in order. It would effectively prevent the scheme from operating at all, by applying it to only a tiny minority of cases. I cannot advise the Committee to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

When he said that amendment No. 268 is superficially attractive, he meant that it is right but that it would cost the Government a lot of money—or would prevent the Government from getting back as much money at the expense of victims as they might otherwise get. Therefore it cannot be allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, it was the arguments advanced by the honourable Lady, not the amendment itself, that were superficially attractive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I perceive the difference. The Minister is saying that our case is one that any reasonable person would accept. But being a Minister in this Government, he is not allowed to accept it. It is unfair to describe the amendment as a wrecking amendment. The Department makes no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>888</span>
payment to compensate someone in any way—let alone doubly—for pain, suffering or loss of amenity. The national insurance scheme does not touch on those matters in any way, shape or form. Whether it should or should not is another matter. Yet under the clause, the Deparment will claw back money awarded for those reasons. That example is at the heart of our objections to the Bill, and the amendment would ensure that the Department could not do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is resisting the amendment only because he has to resist the argument that account should be taken of why damages were awarded. If he did not do so, the Government would have to change the thrust of clause 18. They do not wish to do that because they would then save a great deal less money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is quite wrong, but I hope that we shall be able to return to the matter on clause stand part. Because of that, and in the light of the Minister's observations about amendment No. 192, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The problem is the "relevant period", which is defined as five years. The Bill seeks to

In the case of a disease, "relevant period" is defined as
	<br><q><p>"the period of 5 years beginning with the date on which the victim first claims a relevant benefit in consequence of the disease".</p></q>
In the other cases it is defined as
	<br><q><p>"the period of 5 years immediately following the day on which the accident or injury in question occurred".</p></q>
The definition makes the scheme something of a lottery, since the amount of benefit repayable—and whether benefit is repayable—will depend on how long it takes to settle the claim. It places a premium on quick settlements. In many cases, it is the victim who can least withstand the pressure for a quick settlement, while the compensator can let the settlement drift on.

Placing a premium on quick settlements will minimise the liability to repay benefits. In some cases, that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>889</span>
May be a good thing, but it could also result in a lower settlement being obtained than would otherwise have been achieved—or in a hasty decision to accept an offered settlement, in the knowledge that every week's delay would reduce its value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To make the relevant period run right up to the date of the final payment will also make it far more difficult to calculate the amount to be repaid, which will increase from week to week and perhaps be affected by increases or reductions in benefit rates, or changes in the claimant's circumstances. For instance, we appreciate that there is a difficulty in the current period of change—or "transition", to use that terrible word. It must be a nightmare to go through the facts and reach clear decisions that are acceptable to both parties when one considers the great morass of impenetrability that the Government have created in the name of alleged simplicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To place a much lower time limit on the relevant period—the amendment suggests reducing the five years to the much shorter six months—would mean that in most cases the amount to be deducted would be known well in advance of the final payment. The compensator and the victim would also know from the start whether the amount of benefit was below the "small payment" limit, which is described later in the Bill. If the amount is below that level, no deduction would have to be made. The pressure to arrive at a quick settlement—which in almost every case would be against the victim's best interests—would be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from those practical advantages, people would find it much easier to understand an arrangement under which the liability to repay benefits was fixed at a fairly early stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is another amendment that would so restrict the operation of the scheme as to make it inoperable. The time limit suggested is totally unrealistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to explain the difference between the new system, if Parliament approves it and the existing system. At present, some benefits are offset by 50 per cent. over a full five years, even if the settlement is made much earlier. Other benefits are offset by 100 per cent. over the same period. Indeed they may be offset for a longer period, way into the future. The amount offset reduces the compensated liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides that the amount to be recouped will be limited to the date of settlement or five years, whichever is the earlier. It is worth noting that 80 per cent. of settlements take place within two and a half years of an injury. The amount deducted from a victim will be no different, whether it is offset by the compensator or recouped from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with the important matter of interim payments. Again, we are dealing with the practicalities of the Bill's operation. The matter is of concern not only to Opposition Members but to the Association of British Insurers. That body has drawn attention to the cases where there is. fortunately, no disagreement over liability to compensate a victim, but the final assessment of the level of compensation is awaiting medical and other evidence. In such cases, it is not an uncommon for an interim payment to be made to the victim. I assume that, whatever else members of the Committee may disagree about, we all believe that such payments are desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the judgment on the case has been made. Liability and the need for compensation have been accepted. All that remains to be judged is the final amount. In the meantime, the victim is suffering various difficulties. I am talking about cases where the compensator, has no quarrel with the fact that it would suit everyone for the victim to begin to receive some element of the payment which may ultimately be made. In that way, the decision on the final settlement need not be hurried through as the victim is incurring difficulties because no money is being received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Interim payments are quite commonly made to enable the victims to have alterations made to their home, to improve the quality of life or to purchase some vital piece of equipment, such as a wheelchair. Electric wheelchairs can be very expensive. As the Bill stands, insurance companies will have to delay making an interim payment until a certificate is obtained from the Department of Social Security. That system would create hardship for the victims, and no one would benefit from it. It is yet another administrative hurdle standing in the way of what is agreed to be fair compensation to be partly delivered to the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested that benefits should not be repayable until the date of final settlement, as in the case of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0514">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>891</span>
other claims where no interim payment has been made, and, even though it is with regard to the final settlement that benefits are taken account, interim payments should not be precluded. However, it appears that the Bill would preclude them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 193 is one way of achieving our aim. Amendment No. 194 is an alternative way of doing so. The Minister is quite free to choose between the amendmets, as long as he accepts one of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not avail myself of the choice offered to me by the honourable Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett). The amendments are unnecessary. It would be possible to meet the aim of the amendments in an administrative way. However, I understand what the honourable Lady is seeking to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are having discussions with the insurance industry, and where companies wish to make an interim payment—I acknowledge the benefit that can accrue when such a payment is easily available—it should pay for the adaptation, to use the honourable Lady's example, and also the amount that would be deducted. Instead of paying £2,000, the companies would pay £2,000 plus the extra amount. We should not go down the road suggested by the honourable Lady because, although an amount may be paid as an interim payment, it may turn out to be the final payment. If the compensator found at the end that there were no further payments to be made, there would be no money from which the Secretary of State could be compensated for the benefits that had been paid. As I have said, we are discussing the matter with the insurance industry and I believe that we can achieve the effect desired by the honourable Lady, as I hope we shall soon announce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The honourable Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) was the only Conservative Member who gave tongue, and his honourable Friends appear by their silence to have concluded that the Government's case is made. We maintain that the Government's proposals wil cause substantial injustice and lead to delay and an increasing number of cases going to court instead of being settled outside, which might be better for all concerned. I presume that Conservative Members have accepted, as they so frequently do, the judgment of Ministers that that will not be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I wish to draw attention to the review undertaken in 1986 and the paper that was published by the Lord Chancellor's Department in February of that year. The civil justice review was launched by Lord Hailsham when he was Lord Chancellor and it surveyed a number of aspects of legislation. One paper dealt with personal injury litigation and made severe criticism of the existing system for being costly, the cause of unnecessary delay and too expensive. There were similar criticisms in the general issues paper which formed part of that review process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ironic that two or three years after that review, with its criticisms of the cost and unnecessary suffering caused by delays, the Government responsible for it should propose legislation which everyone but them accepts will considerably exacerbate delays and inevitably increase costs. The Opposition are greatly worried by that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I refer to the way in which the Government seek to change the law and are undermining what, until now, have been reasonably well understood principles. However complicated and, in some respects, unsatisfactory the existing system may have been, it appears to many people besides ourselves that the Government will make matters substantially worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw attention to the observations of the Law Society, which I understand have been sent to all members of the Committee, although whether Conservative Members read them is another matter. The Law Society, although doubting whether the Government will make as much money as the National Audit Office assumes, is confident that further delays will inevitably be caused to victims seeking compensation, involving greater expense to both the victim and the compensator and a likely increase in premiums. The insurance companies will at least attempt to recoup some of the losses substained by the compensators, but that will not help the victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The victims stand to gain nothing out of the proposals in clause 18, although the Government may. The compensators and the employers stand to make an initial loss which, as good business people, they will doubtless seek, in various ways, to recoup. The only person who stands to lose, without any possibility of remedying his loss, will be the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0515">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>893</span>
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the question of the way in which the Government are changing the principle by which these matters have been handled. The Law Society draws attention to the fact that the reason behind the compromise in the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948—that perhaps half of past earnings might be recouped—was the judgment that an element within the employee's national insurance contribution provided for benefit to insure the individual, on a crude basis, against the risk of being unable to work because of illness, or personal injury caused by an accident. The employer's contribution also contains such an element.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society points out that these elements were in the nature of insurance payments and that it is a principle of law, supported by judicial authority, that when an individual makes provision for his own benefit that individual alone, should be allowd to profit from the investment. Yet in these circumstances that individual will not profit from the results of his investment, but the Government will. Once again, the Government are moving the goal posts. To us that is an important point of principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other important principle that the Government are attacking the undermining in clause 18 is whether any attention should be given to the heads of damages under which compensation payments are awarded. Members of the Committee who have been listening to these debates can be sure that the Government are not resisting such a proposal because it would be more just than what they intend. Nor would it conflict with the principle of double compensation, that the Government claim to be pursuing—a claim that we aim to disprove. The reason is simply that, if the Government were to pay any attention to the reasons why compensation has been given, they would be able to claw back a lot less money. That is absolutely outrageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We said earlier that if statutory sick pay is to be deducted it should be deducted from damages awarded for loss of earnings. The outrageous and damaging proposal that the Government are making, in particular the way in which claims for pain and suffering and loss of amenity are attacked by the provisions in the Bill, is totally unjustifiable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of damages, and the reason why the tort system of damages exists alongside the benefits paid by the state, is simply that the benefits paid by the state, contain no element of compensation for injury, accident or disease. The benefits paid by the state, for which the individual has contributed in most cases, recognise the existence of the injury and deal with its financial and other consequences. That is why we have a parallel system of compensation intended to put the plaintiff in the position that he was in before the accident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps that can never be done adequately. Certainly, it is widely believed that compensation payments are inadequate under our present system, but that is the only way in which that principle can be recognised in terms of financial compensation. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>894</span>
Bill will erode that vital principle in a way that has never been accepted before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.35 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already drawn attention to what the Pearson Commission said about the Parry v. Cleaver case in 1969 and to the more recent decision of Hodgson v. Trapp. In both cases it was decided that attendance allowance could be regarded as a relevant benefit and deducted, but only from the compensation payment for care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government continually reiterate the inaccurate claim that they are worried about double compensation when in fact they are recouping benefits and may leave victims with no benefits at all. It is double withdrawal rather than double compensation. We have received a string of representations from different groups, all of whom draw attention to the fact that the repayment of DSS benefits to the full extent that the Government demand will erode and exhaust completely the amount designated as compensation for pain and suffering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the DSS has issued draft outline procedures—on the assumption that the clause will go through unamended—which empower the inspectors to examine insurers' compensation papers. There has not yet been a definition of what the compensation papers will include, but they will probably include the confidential files of solicitors advising victims. Such files may hold numerous confidential documents, including medical and psychiatric reports and medical records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify the Department's intentions in that respect and say what powers DSS inspectors will have to inspect previously confidential files? We are concerned about that matter of principle. The proposals will create uncertainty and delay and will cause difficulties for people seeking to negotiate a settlement. They will be unable to ascertain exactly what benefits will be paid. The issue of disagreement about benefits has been put to us and will arise when we examine the certificate of total benefits. If a victim disagrees, he may appeal to a medical appeals tribunal, but he and his advisers may find that the case has been settled without a court hearing expert medical witnesses. A hearing may have to take place, in any case, before a medical appeals tribunal, where the question of benefits will be discussed—but without the benefit of expert medical evidence or an experienced judge. That could duplicate proceedings and cause difficulties for the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many cases now proceed almost to the door of the court before negotiations take place and a settlement is reached. But settlement may become impossible in many cases, leading to far more court hearings, simply because of the difficulty that the Government are causing by demanding extra assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.40 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My honourable Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) dealt ably with contributory negligence. The Government seek to remove an element of double compensation. Where there is contributory negligence, there is no que^ion of double compensa-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0516">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>895</span>
tion. Part of the compensation that might otherwise have been paid will be lost. Yet the Department will seek to recover all the benefits, as though full compensation had been paid, without any offsetting deduction. In that case the Government—not the individual—will be getting double compensation. That will apply to about 50 per cent. of cases. The Minister suggested that it would be wrong for that to be taken into account. The assessment of contributory negligence might be as high as 95 per cent., and the Government would recoup only 5 per cent. of benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my honourable Friend the Member for Newport, West pointed out, where there is no question of contributory negligence and that person is wholly negligent—100 per cent. at fault and thus the sole cause of the accident, injury or disease—there will be no question of recoupment of benefit. It is only the person who suffers through the fault of someone else who will lose the damages that he or she might otherwise receive, because of the operation of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point - unless the Minister provokes me further, which is always possible - is the amount of compensation that has been paid. We have touched on that point over and over again when discussing the amendments. The Government are proceeding wholly on the basis of double compensation and of adequate double compensation. I know of no expert body that supports the argument - I do not even think that the Minister has advanced it himself- that full compensation is ever paid. That view is widely accepted by compensators and victims alike. The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council states:
	<br><q><p>"The assumption that a tort award fully meets the insured worker's financial needs in respect of past, present and future losses … is not valid."</p></q>
That is a simple, straightforward and blunt statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give one practical example of the way in which damages are awarded, and of the difficulties that are likely to be caused because the Government wilfully refuse to take account of how compensation is being awarded. There was a case reported in 1986 of a man aged 47 at the date of the accident and 48 at the date of the trial, so his case came to trial earlier than usual. He was a former machine operator and a keen do-it-yourself man who had redecorated his home to a good standard and serviced his own car. All of us know that that means that he saved substantial sums of money. He was a right-handed person. His right arm was caught between the rollers of a printer slotter machine, which resulted in the traumatic amputation of his arm below the elbow. He was in hospital for three and a half weeks and required surgical re-amputation two to three inches above the elbow to make a stump suitable for the fitting of an artificial limb.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even then, difficulty in fitting such a limb satisfactorily was experienced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man was unfit for work for about 15 months. Ultimately, he was fortunate enough to get work as a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>896</span>
decorator on a community project under the job creation scheme, but with substantial earnings loss. He continued to suffer pain, phantom limb sensation, tingling and difficulty with his artificial limbs. He could paint, but was unable to work on ladders. He considered himself to be carried by his workmates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The days when people can be carried by their workmates are almost over. Employers are now encouraged to cut costs ruthlessly. Increasingly, many people who are capable of light work, to use the Department's phrase, who can make a contribution, who are anxious to remain in work, and who would in the past have been carried to some extent by workmates or employers as a quid pro quo for their many years of conscientious service are unemployed because it is not practicable or possible for workmates to carry them and their employers do not permit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That man was fortunate, at least when judgment on his case was reached, but he may now be unemployed. At home, he is unable to do the work that he had done for himself. He can drive a car only with an automatic gear box, which will be substantially more expensive than the car he had previously, and of course he cannot service it himself any more. He is developing further symptoms and problems that may require another operation. His future prospects, medically and for employment, were considered uncertain at the time of the trial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general compensation that that man was awarded for pain, damages and loss of amenities was assessed at £33,000. He was awarded £6,300 for future loss of earnings and future costs. Most of us would feel that, although the court did its best, that amount may not take care of additional costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That man received total general damages of £76,700, £33,000 of which - almost half - was for pain, suffering and loss of amenities. That level of compensation is not unknown. However, for the first time, the Department's proposals will erode that level of settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council has given striking examples of how the Department's proposals will work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It suggests that if a 35-year-old factory worker earning £150 a week lost an arm, under the law as it previously stood, with half his benefits being withdrawn, he would still have had to repay total deductions of £12,300, out of total damages of £72,000, but he would still have reveived a net amount of £59,700.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if all benefits are deducted from his damages, he will receive only £49,400 and £22,600 would be payable to the DSS. Earlier, we drew attention to the coy little reference in the Conservative central office document which was circulated to Conservative Members and which said that "some" victims may lose out to "some" extent. A victim in the circumstances that I have outlined would lose nearly £10,500 of his compensation to the Department. The Departmentt would make £22,000 and he would make £50,000. The Department would recoup about half the money he received. In that case, the suggestion is that some £30,000 of the damages he received would have been specifically for pain and suffering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0517">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>897</span>
The second example is a waiter who breaks his leg and is off work for six months and who has some savings. It is suggested that as the law stands he might finally receive some £1,700 and that the Department would recoup £1,500. The Department would therefore recoup almost as much as he would receive, although that is the only way in which he can be compensated for his injuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final example is a cleaner aged 30 who is blinded in an industrial accident and unable to work. The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council suggests that she might receive damages of more than £100,000 and that, as matters stand at present, the Department would recoup some £20,000 of that, leaving her with just over £80,000. That is on the assumption that it is an industrial accident, that she is a single parent and that there are various other factors. However, under the proposals the Department would recoup almost £40,000 leaving her with just under £65,000. This is someone who has been completely blinded in an industrial accident, yet two thirds of the damages that she is awarded could be recouped by the Department, leaving her with substantially less damages than was probably intended. A high proportion of such damages would be for pain and suffering, loss of future earnings and all the other difficulties that someone might experience and they would almost be wiped out by the recoupment by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have argued throughout the debate on the clause, the Government's proposal is unjust. It will cause further delays and difficulties and will undoubtedly result in many victims being penalised by the Government' decision rather than by the fact that they may have had some responsibility for the terrible incidents or illnesses that have befallen them. Once again, the Government's main aim, although it is cloaked in all sorts of acceptable sounding rhetoric and a fog of phrases such as "double compensation," is to make savings on the social security budget. The last thing that concerns them is the pain, the suffering and the injustice that will be experienced by those who are already disadvantaged by suffering injury or disease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the honourable Member for Derby, South (Mrs Beckett). She has effectively and comprehensively taken the Government's case to pieces. This is a technical measure but the injustice and the confusion and delays that will result are evident to everyone, even if he or she is not involved in the nitty gritty of technical practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am no expert. As a provincial solicitor in the Scottish borders I dealt with occasional clients, but the evidence of people who are actively engaged in this line of business day in and day out is now available. We are foolish if we do not pay careful account to what they say. Both the legal fraternity and the insurers who have provided me with representations on the Bill believe that major difficulties and injustices lie ahead when it is enacted. This clause will result in the damages paid to victims of an accident at work or a road accident for their pain and suffering being entirely obliterated by the obligation imposed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>898</span>
on the compensator to repay the full amount of social security benefits received by the victim prior to any settlement cheque being released to the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The briefings from the Department make it plain to practising lawyers and insurers that if the legislation remains unamended it will expect DSS benefits to be repaid irrespective of whether that exhausts completely the element of settlement or award of damages to the victim which has been designated as compensation for pain and suffering. That is the main criticism of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the honourable Gentleman agree that the damages awarded will probably take account of the fact that that money has to be repaid, so that the person who will pay will not be the victim but the individual paying the damages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, that shows ignorance of how the system works. My experience is that such settlements are arrived at without going to a court of law or official tribunal, and there is no guarantee whatsoever that the provisions of clause 18 will be reflected in higher awards being made.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the honourable Gentleman aware that when a compensation claim is discussed and resolved, it relates to the injury, trauma and damage to career prospects that are suffered?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I stand to be corrected by the experts, but I think that a court of law would be under no compulsitor to pay any attention to social security legislation when assessing damages, and I should be amazed if that were to be the case at law in future, after the enactment of clause 18.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The administrative procedures for certification and the deduction of the benefits at each stage in the claim, which are set out in schedule 2, are thought by people to whom I have spoken to be certain to cause a great deal of delay in compensation claims as well as reducing the net damages received by accident victims in the United Kingdom. The Law Society of Scotland, the Law Society of England and Wales, the Association of British Insurers, the claims and legal departments of many public industries and the Confederation of British Industry are united in their opposition to the clause.

The fear that there will be increased complications and delays in achieving speedy and adequate settlements are well founded, but I want to make it clear to Conservative Members that we are talking not just about victims of accidents at work; survivors of future air or rail disasters may be caught by the clause and Conservative Members should consider that carefully when deciding whether to support it.

will be placed on that access. As a practising solicitor, I can say that if a DSS inspector came up the stairs to my legal office in Hawick, he would get short shrift from me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
