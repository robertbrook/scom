	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 88, in page 6, line 1, leave our paragraph (b)</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment no. 89, in page 6, line 7, leave out from "(2)" to " For" in line 9 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"After subsection (4) of that section there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A).'."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now embarking on clause 9, and in our debates on amendments to it, there will be a tendency to bring in more than one subject, although we shall obviously do our best to keep within order. However, we are also coming into one of the most crucial parts of the Bill. You know, Mr. Winterton, the importance we attach to the introduction of the new test of actively seeking work in clause 7. One reason why we attach so much importance to clauses 7 and 10 is that we are worried about the way in which the test will be set and how it will affect people's prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments here retain the term "suitable employment" from section 20(1) of the Social Security Act 1975, and the qualification of the term is contained in section 20(4). It occurs in three paragraphs which set out the circumstances in which someone might come to be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term occurs, first, when a situation in any suitable employment has been properly notified to a person either as vacant or about to become vacant, and he has "without good cause" refused, failed to apply for, or to accept, that situation when offered to him. Those are clear and sensible criteria, which, contrary to the impression given by some hon. Members on Second Reading, were put into law by the previous Labour Government. Therefore, I hope that we shall hear no more nonsense such as, "Does the Labour party think that everyone should be free to turn down any old job?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important part of section 20(1) refers to the possibility of disqualification if someone has neglected to avail themselves of a reasonable opportunity of suitable employment, or
	<br><blockquote><p>"he has without good cause refused or failed to carry out any official recommendations given to him with a view to assisting him to find suitable employment, being recommendations which were reasonable having regard to his circumstances and to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>382</span>
means of obtaining that employment usually adopted in the district in which he resides".</p></blockquote>
Section 20(4) of the 1975 Act provides further guidance as to the meaning of "suitable," by saying that employment is not suitable if it is a vacancy resulting from a trade dispute. Employment is a person's
	<br><blockquote><p>"usual occupation in the district where he was last ordinarily employed"—</p></blockquote>
though with lower wages or less favourable conditions, or:
	<br><blockquote><p>"employment in his usual occupation in any other district"—</p></blockquote>
with wages or conditions below the standards set for that district by collective agreement, or recognised by good employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, enshrined in the 1975 Act are a set of principles that have for 60 or 70 years been basic to our employment and social security legislation. I am not as expert in these matters as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short), but I believe that these principles are related to a range of other legislation that existed before this Government, such as wages council legislation and so on. It should not be possible for an unscrupulous employer to use the law to attack and lower the wages and conditions of his work force below what is fair or reasonable. The provisions of potential disqualification should apply not just to any employment but to employment that it was reasonable to expect someone to undertake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The implication of some aspects of these elements of the legislation is that employment in a different occupation would not normally be regarded as suitable. Section 20(4) also provides that after a reasonable interval other employment would be deemed suitable, provided that the wages and conditions were not below recognised standards. That is the existing law, and it offers plenty of safeguards to protect the insurance fund from someone who willfully refuses to look for work, even when it is reasonable for them to do so and even when that work is available, which is the heart of concern about the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deletes the word "suitable" and section 20(4). It preserves some of the safeguards by introducing the new section 20A. That new section provides that, as has always been the case, a person will not be disqualified for refusing to seek or accept a job vacancy resulting from a trade dispute, but only during the permitted period. However, it does not cover all the safeguards that used to be derived from the expression "suitable employment".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I first read the Bill I was more than a little concerned by the clause, but I assumed that the permitted period would be of fairly substantial duration. Therefore, I was horrified to see in the notes on clauses that the permitted period will last a maximum of three months. That ties in with existing practice in as much as it has been generally accepted that after three months, if there is no prospect of someone getting suitable employment similar to his previous employment or reasonable employment in another occupation, he was expected to broaden his horizon. Broadening one's horizons is quite different from being subject to a whole range of sanctions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>383</span>
The Government set out in the notes on clauses the circumstances in which the maximum period may be considered to exist. One must not assume that the maximum permitted period will be allowed in every case. It will depend upon the length of time a person has previously been employed, his experience in that employment and the range of employment opportunities open to that individual. Only after careful consideration of those factors could the maximum period be awarded. That clearly implies that for many people the chances are high that the permitted period will be rather lower than three months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person might be expected to take a job in his usual occupation even during the permitted period which is in his own district on less favourable conditions, other than wages, than he was accustomed to or in another district on conditions, including wages below the locally agreed or recognised standard. The most important change is that whatever may be pressed on the person during the permitted period—however short it may be—after the permitted period, the wages can no longer be taken into account in deciding whether someone should be expected to accept a particular job. The Government are reluctant to write an explicit safeguard into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would preserve the safeguards that have existed almost unaltered in tenor since 1911. A change as substantial, if not more so, as those under clause 7 is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The use of the word "suitable" is an illustration of the way in which we fear the provision will work. Already, the Government's tightening up of the practical operation of the existing law is leading to treatment of individuals and judgments of whether they are really looking for work that we find difficult to accept, and even Conservative Members might find them a little alarming. The Government suggest that the legislation will lift the restrictions or increase the flexibility—I forget the exact words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am sure that the Government hope that people will imagine that the Government mean by that phrase that the legislation will facilitate matching suitable job places with people who have been specifically trained to fill them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps "believe" was the word that I should have used. Blind faith is what the Government require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An example from casework by the citizens advice bureau in the Lancashire-Cumbria area is of someone who had undertaken a course of instruction to familiarise himself with computers with the specific intention of increasing his employment prospects. That seems to me to be an extremely reasonable thing for him to have done, and I feel confident that the Government will applaud. When the course ended, he signed on and completed the suitable form and said on it—not unreasonably—that he would prefer to work with computers. That is why he had done the course and that was where he was looking for a better employment opportunity. His unemployment benefit was suspended because it was held that that restricted his availability for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an assumption of mismatch and a denial of someone's reasonable attempts to prepare himself for a particular employment opportunity. One cannot say that that man is looking for a job in an obscure part of the textile trade that no longer exists, thereby putting such a restriction on the employment that he seeks that it would be impossible to find a job. It seems perfectly reasonable in this day and age for someone to say that he prefers to work with computers, and hopes to find a job in such circumstances. Such is the eagerness to remove people from the unemployment register that a perfectly reasonable observation of that sort can lead to questioning, even under the present law. Under the Bill, if it is enacted, such pressure will be greatly increased. I assume that the Government hope that the introduction of the term "without good cause" in subsection (l)(c) will suggest that there will be an element of reasonableness in the decisions. Nevertheless, the emphasis of the legislation is completely shifted with this set of changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "suitable employment" has been widely used in employment legislation since about 1911. That term has bearing on the skills and training required of a job, and directs itself to the job on which judgment must be made. Although "without good cause" qualifies whether it is reasonable to accept or refuse a job, it is not a judgment of the job, skills or training required and whether those match the individual. It is a judgment of the person and whether he or she had good reason for making a decision. It lacks all the qualifications about wages and conditions for suitable employment. The decision will be a judgment by an adjudication officer, and so will be infinitely more subject to prejudice and value judgment. I suspect that the Government will say that that value judgment will be excercised sympathetically and sensitively. I hope that it will, but "without good cause" exists in present legislation and we have various examples of its use. It implies judgment of the person.

	<span class='label label-info column'>385</span>
In the east midlands, an individual left work because he was unhappy with the pressure put on him to be dishonest by the manager of the shop in which he worked. The manager wanted the individual to falsify delivery sheets so that deliveries of a particular sort were recorded. The individual was unwilling to do that, so he left the job. He was deemed to have left work without just cause. I concede that such a judgment may have been possible in the interim period before inquiry. However, I doubt that on inquiry, the shop manager would say, "Oh yes, he left because I wanted him to falsify his worksheets." The manager would give quite another reason. The chances must be high that the individual will remain disqualified from unemployment benefit, unless he can find suitable witnesses to say that similar things happened to them. That may not be easy because, even now, people are reluctant to give evidence of dishonesty by others. They worry about whether that will handicap their future employment prospects. I suspect such fears will increase once the Bill is enacted. We have good cause to be anxious about the pattern of changes introduced by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "suitable" in effect removes all reference to wages and conditions as does the removal of subsection 20(4). It was suggested on Second Reading, that it is necessary to remove those longstanding safeguards because otherwise people will tend to seek unrealistically high wages and conditions and, merely by dint of saying that opportunities available are unsuitable, can continue to draw benefit, rather than take up work. Fair levels of pay are the subject of the next debate, so I shall not say too much about that now. However, as that is behind this part of the clause, it is right to refer to the fact that the Government's principal argument in introducing the Bill, and especially clauses 7, 9 and 10, has been that a survey of the London labour market showed that a tiny minority of people were not looking for work as actively as the Government thought that they should. That same survey cuts the ground from under clause 9, because it shows that the long-term unemployed do not have unrealistically high wage expectations. Their hopes and expectations of the wages that they could command were within the average paid by London employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no justification in the source material on which the Government have chosen to rely for assuming that there is a need to remove from the legislation all the existing protection of wages and conditions. That is even less true, as we might expect, in the case of men with families. They were even more prepared than the vast majority of unemployed people to accept lower wages and worse conditions because they were worried about their families and anxious to get back into work if humanly possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something else worries me about the attitudes enshrined in the clause. Ministers have argued that there is work available. They do not say that such work is suitable because, if that were the case, the clause would not need to be drafted in this way. Ministers argue that the only reason that unemployed people are not in work is because they are not running round desperately doing everything possible to obtain work. Potentially, this part of the Bill is extremely damaging to many unemployed people. I am not
	<span class='label label-info column'>386</span>
referring to the potential harassment that will arise from the provisions of clauses 7 and 10. Sadly, to take a job doing work different from that in which one was previously engaged could considerably damage one's chances of getting back into the original type of work. It may do even more damage than seeking a return to the original occupation while unemployed. That is a difficult judgment to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
General experience and anecdotal evidence suggest that someone who has been made redundant from a managerial position, for example, will find it difficult to get a similar position again, certainly at the speed which this part of the Bill requires. Unfortunately, such people may find it even more difficult to regain a similar occupation if, in the meantime, they have been forced by the legislation to take another occupation that pays less than they previously earned, and where the demands of the job are below their expectations. That should not be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings us back those parts of the survey on which the Government depend that they have chosen to ignore. The only part to which they have paid the slightest attention is that suggesting that some unemployed people may not be busting a gut to look for work that they believe is not even there. The Government have ignored the section that suggests that in looking for work, unemployed people are not pricing themselves out of the market by their requirements on wages and conditions. The Government have also ignored the sections suggesting that employers are not simply reluctant to look for new workers among the ranks of the unemployed, but are unaware that that is where such workers may be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discussed the matter with many people in similar circumstances. It does not matter what respect I or other members of the Committee may have for a particular occupation into which someone may be forced by the legislation. What matters is how future employers may judge it, and future employers seem to be extremely ignorant and prejudiced. One of their strongest prejudices is that, if someone is pushed into a low-grade job, that is justified and there is no point in considering them for more difficult or testing work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill is passed unamended, applications to companies of any size, whether for manual or clerical work for which the applicant may be eminently qualified and which may benefit the community and the applicant, will never reach the employer or personnel manager. One can readily envisage an employer sifting through a heap of applications for a job of standing or importance. Applications that say, "I was a senior manager in company X, but my section closed down and I have now been unemployed for X number of months", will go down badly, as employers tend automatically to think that there must be something wrong with such people, otherwise they would not be on the scrapheap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a little more understanding in recent years—if not in London—that that may not be the individual's fault. However, if instead of a form saying that the applicant was in a certain position until so many months ago and is now unemployed, it says that his present occupation is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>387</span>
janitor in the public lavatories in Westminister—like a man whom the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope) and I met on a television programme recently—or that the applicant is now a junior manager although he used to be a senior manager, the employer will probably not even bother to look at the section on previous occupation. He will simply think, "What makes him think he can apply for this job?" and the form will go on the large pile of applications that are automatically rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 has the potential to force people into employment that will damage their long-term prospect of obtaining employment for which they are well suited and through which they could serve the community. That is an undesirable and stupid thing for a Government to do. Moreover, it will cause enormous resentment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the programme that I mentioned, most people who spoke about seeking work referred to a "suitable" job. Naturally, one hopes that that would be a job with decent wages. They expressed an assumption, which the Prime Minister so much deplores, that has been built up over decades of what she considers Socialism, although some Opposition Members would like it to go a little further before we give it that name. It is the assumption that people have some rights and dignity and should not be exploited.I know, having listened to many of their speeches, that many Conservative Members would question the assumption—not for themselves, as that is different—that someone is entitled to say, "I want only a job with decent wages and conditions." The whole thrust of the Bill is that people must take any job under any circumstances, even if it is part-time or temporary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Kirkhope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remember the programme in which the hon. Lady and I appeared recently. Was not the general tone of that programme, as expressed by people who had had to accept temporarily, jobs that were not ideal for them, optimistic? Those people did not seem to begrudge that situation, as the hon. Lady suggests. Many of them had been happy to accept all kinds of jobs throughout their careers, as they believe that working was important and enabled them to give something to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were not the employers who appeared on the programme much more enlightened than the hon. Lady is suggesting? They seemed happy to assess employees regularly to see whether they could give them a better job if they merited it. The hon. Lady is restricting her argument to a narrow area, whereas flexibility is much more, as we heard and saw on that programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the hon. Gentleman's view. In my view, there was some misplaced optimism in people to whom there was not time to explain—they probably would not have believed it, anyway—that wages and conditions would no longer be of any consequence in deciding whether someone should take a job. They assumed that no one would
	<span class='label label-info column'>388</span>
be forced into taking employment with low wages or poor conditions. As I said, that assumption is not justified. In that sense, any optimism was unfounded—at least, it will be if the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that people on the programme were willing to accept any job. Although that is true, neither of the two examples that come to my mind showed optimism. One was of a man who had had a managerial position and who had spent a long time trying very hard to find a similar occupation. The other was of a man who had also had a managerial position but who had accepted the post of janitor in a public lavatory, as that was all that he could get. I would not say that he was optimistic. I spoke to him after the programme—I do not know whether the hon. Member for Leeds, East had a chance to do so—and he certainly did not believe that his job was a temporary staging post; that is where he believed he had finished up. He was putting a brave face on it, but was not happy about it. He was simply prepared to live with it, and I pay tribute to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not recall, either, an enlightened employer saying that he would be prepared to look widely through the ranks of the unemployed. I readily concede that, in the chaos and noise of that television studio, my prejudices may have filtered out such an enlightened employer. Many enlightened employers exist, and I wish that there were more. Equally, the hon. Gentleman must concede that there are many unenlightened employers who seek to exploit the present market and their work force. Under other circumstances the Conservative party would be the first to claim that human nature has not changed since 1911, when the then Conservative party thought it necessary to offer protection to work people from the exploitation of unenlightened employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's recollection and mine of that television programme clearly differ. He will nevertheless concede that many of those who spoke took it for granted that the safeguards that are enshrined in existing legislation, which will be removed by clause 9, ought to exist in a reasonable society. They will be astonished and appalled when they find that they are being removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps one of the greatest failures of the Labour movement is that people have begun to take for granted rights that had to be fought for over many decades—perhaps even hundreds of years. They nurture the illusion, which the Government are fast trying to cure, that no one can take them away. I wonder how long it will be before people realise how much they have lost. It tends to hit them only when they come up against it themselves. They then come to the advice bureaux of people like myself and my hon. Friend, saying, "This cannot be right, there must be a mistake; what has happened?" They also have an unpleasant tendency to demand to know why we did not prevent it. I have the unpleasant tendency to reply that I certainly did not vote Tory in the last election, so "do not come crying to me about it"—though I do not use those terms, since I am not the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South (Mrs. Currie).

Nevertheless, that is an alarming and depressing prospect. If the extent to which the Government are

	<span class='label label-info column'>389</span>
weakening the existing legal safeguards at the risk of damaging people's long-term choices of employment were publicised, there would be considerable public pressure on the Government to back down. However, obtaining such attention is very difficult in that area of the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, the hon. Lady developed a wide case in moving the amendment. I request hon. Members to stick as close as possible to its, as there are many important proposed amendments to the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Winterton, for that remark about sticking to the amendment. I suggest that we should stick precisely to the word "suitable". I urge the Minister, in responding to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), to offer his definition of the word "suitable", and to reflect personally on it. I sometimes get the impression that we are prepared to make suggestions for other people that we ourselves would not find acceptable. We bear some responsibility for putting this question in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are asking people who have been unemployed for some time to take up employment in circumstances that we would not be prepared to accept. Perhaps the Minister would give a definition of "suitable", as the decision of adjudication officers will hinge on that definition. As my hon. Friend says, the key switch in the clause is away from the nature of the work itself to the person himself. Value judgments will be made about that person's individual circumstances, interests and abilities. We must be clear what we mean if we include the word in what is primary legislation so that it is not a heavy, judgmental and loaded word that tells others to do what we ourselves would not be prepared to do. I ask the Minister to respond precisely and to give a definition of that word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall stick absolutely to the amendment, which deals with reinserting the word "suitable". The Government seek to remove the word, so that a person is disqualified from benefit if he does not take a job. We seek to reinsert it. I shall be less polite than my hon. Friends the Members for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) and for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). We are reaching the guts of the Bill. The Government seek to impose a structure that will force people to accept low-paid, grotty work that previously they did not have to accept. There is no honour in that intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even this Government are not so stupid as to think that because they are introducing provisions to require all the unemployed to run round madly every week making applications for jobs, somehow unemployment will disappear. Even they understand that there are about 700,000 vacancies in the economy, which are not distributed regionally in balance with the numbers of unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are not just introducing the change to make people jump through hoops and to be nasty to them. They are doing it in order to force them more and more to accept worse paid
	<span class='label label-info column'>390</span>
employment. The Government believe that that will be good for our economy. It is called ironing out rigidities in the economy. It is thought that it is good for Britain as we go into the next century that more and more people should work in casual, temporary, low-paid employment. That is what the removal of the word "suitable" is about. The notes on clauses refer to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the removal of the references to 'suitable' employment (employment which is currently defined as not suitable is employment which broadly does not offer the rate for the job or which has arisen as a result of a trade dispute)."</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will be able to defend the Government's actions and tell us why it is necessary to remove the word "suitable". What change does he expect in people's behaviour as a result? I see only one outcome. The Government should be deeply ashamed. Many people, struggling hard to get a job and to rise from the poverty that living on benefit means, will continue to struggle when they eventually get a job. Masses of jobs in the economy do not give people that little lift-off in life which means that they have slightly more money and can look after their families and their needs as human beings with more dignity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than half our work force is low paid. The Government's massive achievement is an increase in low-paid work. The removal of the word "suitable" will create even more. It is obviously bad for people to work for low pay and in the employment conditions that tend to go with it, such as little training, little investment and little dignity and it is incredibly bad for our economy. We shall not succeed in the international competition that will increase after 1992 if half our work force has to depend on low pay rates. Major closures of enterprises are expected as a result of 1992. Industrialists throughout Europe expect more closures in Britain; we are less competitive than other countries because our level of investment is so low. The removal of the word "suitable" aims at cutting people's wage levels, forcing them to do rotten jobs. It is bad for people and bad for jobs. I hope that the Minister will find some way of explaining it to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise the gentle warning that you gave us, Mr. Winterton, but it was a warning rather than a ruling. I do not question it, but you suggested that I had strayed wide when moving the amendment. I do not believe that I did. I touched on the context in which the word "suitable" has and will operate. That meant mentioning permitted periods, for example. I was careful not to dwell on issues such as the implications of the permitted period, or levels of pay, on which there is much more to say on later amendments. I hope that you will accept, Mr. Winterton, that the context of "suitable" is in itself wide, and that I did no stray at length into other areas. I do not wish that to be used as a reason for deciding at this early stage whether there should be a clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to clarify the position for the hon. Lady. I said that she had presented her case in a wide way and that that was inevitable because of the word "suitable" and the clause as a

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can make a general point at the outset. The Government believe—as, it is probably fair to say, do the Opposition—that it is better off for people to be in work than to be unemployed. We all want to see—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady would just allow me to complete a sentence or two before she renews her assault, I should be grateful. We believe that it is better for the individuals concerned and for the economy as a whole that people should be in work. They are contributing to the country's wealth. As employment becomes increasingly tight we shall need all the skills that are available to us. As I have often pointed out, in an economy that is constantly changing the fact that someone is in a job at any given time improves his prospects of moving to another job if it becomes available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett:</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Not necessarily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) is shaking her head. I thought that Opposition Members had made strongly the point that unemployed people find it difficult to get into work, and the longer they are unemployed, the more difficult it becomes. If people are in jobs and have a recent record of employment, they find it easier to apply for other jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I was shaking my head, I was saying clearly and audibly, "Not necessarily". That argument has been made by Opposition Members, and we continue to sustain it. It is funny that the Minister should quote it, as he contested it when we put it to him. People who are in work stand a better chance of getting another job. However, there will be cases in which the kind of work that they are in may militate against them getting another job in what would previously have been called a suitable occupation. That is a different and much more narrow point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never contested the assertion that long periods of unemployment make it difficult for people to get back into work. I agree that that happens, and we are seeking to encourage people to take active steps to get back into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the point made by the Hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). Her description of the Government's policies being designed to force people into low-paid work sits uneasily with what has happened to take-home pay since we came into office. Let us consider a married couple with two children, where there is one earner in the family. On half average earnings, the rise in real take home pay has been 22.7 per cent, since the Government came to office, compared with 4.2 per
	<span class='label label-info column'>392</span>
cent, under the previous Labour Government. On 75 per cent, of average earnings, the figure is 26.7 per cent, under this Government, compared with 2.1 per cent, undere the previous Labour Government. The idea that we are trying to hold down wages or force people into low-paid jobs and keep them in poverty does not sit squarely with the Government's achievements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister now owes it to himself and the Committee to go back to his officials, get the figures disaggregated and then look at the movement of income of people in work in the bottom two deciles—the bottom 20 per cent.—as opposed to the top 20 per cent. He will see that the pattern is of a growing movement and a widening gap. Taking the average figures does not expose what has happened to people in low-paid employment. Relatively, there is a greater widening in our society and relatively, income is declining rather than increasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I deliberately gave, as the first set of figures, those on half average earnings. They are people who, by definition, are on relatively low pay, as the Opposition would certainly assert. Yet those people have benefited considerably. I accept that some in the higher deciles have done better than those in the lower ones, but all have benefited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for giving way on this point, because it is crucial to the whole issue. I represent many people who are on less than half the average wage. I remind the Committee that the average wage is £254 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can half of that be reconciled with job adverts in Bramley jobcentre offering adults between £2 and £2.50 an hour? That works out at a lot less than half the average wage for a week's work. The Minister should as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) suggests, look at the figures, which show that people are paid at rates that are much lower than half the average wage, going down to a quarter. People are being expected to accept that as a living wage on which they should keep themselves and their families. If they do not accept that rate of pay, from now on they will not be eligible for benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not reply to that, as I am intervening in the Minister's speech, so I have to be brief. How can the Minister justify asking people to live on such a low wage when we know that they cannot do it? We are talking about a figure much lower than the national average wage. In my constituency, that average wage would seem incredibly high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is totally wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

themselves and their families on those wages. They are not. People can now claim a range of in-job benefits, including jobstart, child benefit and family credit, which were introduced specifically to enable people on low pay to bring up their families. The Government have tackled this problem affecting people in low-paid jobs, which the previous Labour Government dealt with very inadequately. I accept that family credit has too low a take-up, and we want to see that increase, but already twice as much money is being spent on that scheme as was spent on family income supplement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What are the advantages of low-paid work for a single person who is not eligible for any of those benefits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was responding to the point made by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), who asserted that people were expected to bring up their families on low pay. There are many people in low-paid work who live in someone else's household and do not have the sort of expenses involved in maintaining themselves independently or bringing up families. Many people in part-time jobs are not the family's breadwinner, but are helping to augment the family's income. The Opposition's assertions often ignore a range of factors involved in this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have barely got through the first two drafted sentences, but I shall, as always, give way to the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. He is right to say that many low-paid workers bring in a household's second income, but families do not consist only of dependent children. Families can include aunties, uncles and dependent elderly parents. Someone can be in low-paid work and not entitled to family credit even though he or she has a dependent mother or father. About 4.4 million households headed by a low-paid wage earner, live in poverty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny that there are low-paid jobs in the economy. Whatever happens to real living standards and real pay, there will always be some people who are, by definition, low paid. They are relatively low paid. That is a much wider argument than you would allow me to pursue in the context of the amendment, Mr. Winterton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How would the Minister define low paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said, I do not think that I would be allowed to pursue that argument. Opposition Members, in Committee and in the House, frequently assert that because people earn a particular percentage of the average, they are by definition, low paid. That is such a wide argument that it could occupy the Committee for the whole morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>394</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I should like to get on. The hon. Gentleman cannot criticise me for not having given way, but I shall not do so now as I want to get on and explain why I shall advise the Committee to reject the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Opposition Members have pointed out, section 20(4) of the Social Security Act 1975 requires it to be shown that employment is suitable in the case of the individual claimant before a sanction can be applied in relation to a failure to follow up the particular employment opportunity. We propose to replace those provisions, but the amendment would retain them. We do not agree with that, but certain provisions should remain on the statute book. The first such provision, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) concerns employment that has become vacant as a result of a trade dispute causing a stoppage of work. As hon. Members will have noticed, we intend to continue to ensure that claimants are not expected to take up such a vacancy. We propose to provide specifically that failure to follow up any such vacancy will not be penalised. That we would do in subsection (3) by the proposed new section 20A(1)(a). Our reason for this is our belief that if claimants were referred to jobs that are not being done because the people who normally do them are on strike, the Government could, and would, be accused of intervening deliberately and directly in the dispute and of strike breaking. This would also require unemployment claimants to cross picket lines to go to work. Trade disputes usually concern matters between employer and employees and should be resolved by them with the help of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service if necessary. It is not for the Government to provide a pool of labour from which replacements for the strikers will be provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, the other provisions which set down what employment shall be deemed not to be suitable all have regard to the rate of pay in the employment. While we believe it right that, immediately after becoming unemployed, a claimant should be able to concentrate on looking for work which offers a rate of pay similar to what he has been receiving—and we are providing that by way of our concept of a "permitted period"—we do not believe that an automatic right to a certain level of pay is helpful. I shall return to that matter later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consequently, we propose to replace the two concepts—suitability of the employment and whether the claimant has good cause for failing to pursue it—by one concept, that of good cause alone. Good cause can take account of matters such as travelling difficulties, health, physical capabilities and domestic arrangements, but we shall exclude the rate of pay when considering whether the employment is suitable or whether there provides good cause for turning it down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one sets aside the concept of the rate of pay, good cause and suitability are close together conceptually. If employment is not suitable for a claimant because, for example, it would be liable to damage his health, he will, under current provisions, also have good cause for failing to pursue it. In considering good cause, therefore, the adjudicating
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>395</span>
authorities will—setting aside the rate of pay—also be taking into account suitability. I believe that dealing with the whole lot under a single heading makes a great deal of sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate of pay itself is an aspect that concerns hon. Members. We shall discuss next a series of amendments on the level of pay; we can most suitably deal with many of the arguments under that heading. In essence, what I am saying is that employers seek to recruit staff at rates of pay that they can afford. If they cannot recruit staff at anything other than the so-called "rate for the job", we are introducing rigidities into the labour market that are unhelpful to employers, potential employees and the economy as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other disruptive effect of retaining the outmoded concept of a rate for the job is that it takes no account of an individual's ability to command a particular wage. That comes back to some of the points that the hon. Member for Derby, South was making earlier and the television programme in which I gather she and my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope) took part. Should an employer really be expected to pay the same money to somebody who has not worked for a year or more, who may need retraining and bringing back into the habits and skills of work, as he would to someone who is fully skilled and currently in work? Is it unreasonable for an employer to say that initially at least he is prepared only to offer a lower wage but that he will give the individual a chance to improve his skills and his capacity for work and to make a greater contribution to the wealth that the employer is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has been the normal practice in industry and commerce since time began. People would come in at a junior rate—a trainee rate—then be promoted to the scale rate for the job. That is no problem. We spoke about our unhappiness about wages councils because we have always seen them as applying a minimum, not a maximum, rate for the job. The Minister is introducing a difficulty that is not there. It has been solved; it has been no problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that an employee, or somebody seeking work, should not be able to impose a restriction and say that a job is not suitable for him because it does not pay the same rate as he was getting a year earlier. That is the restriction that we seek to remove.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not right. The Minister does not understand his own Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is one restriction that we are seeking to remove in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about what the Minister is suggesting. I did not understand that the removal of the word "suitable" made it into a clause where one could draw comparisons: that one would be able to go to one's next employer, or prospective employer, and say, "I got this rate in the last job;
	<span class='label label-info column'>396</span>
therefore I demand the same level." In real life, people going for a job may already have accepted that it may not be the best job for them and may not fulfil their potential. They go because there may well be nothing else. I have known people to say, "OK, I give in, there's not going to be much consolation in the job or much job satisfaction, but what money shall I get for doing it?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is saying that the employer can decide the rate of pay without negotiating it. If someone feels that the money is not enough to live on and says, "No", from that point on he will be damned by the clause. Is that not the truth of it? It is not a question of a comparison between what someone earned before and what he wants to earn now; many people accept less than they earned in a previous job because they have to start again and work up through the scale, if they have had a spell of unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two aspects to be tackled. First, the individual will not be able to say that because he is being offered less for doing the same job after he has been out of work, that job is not suitable for him because it is not paying him what he was getting before. Secondly, just because there is a wage level in a particular area for a certain job, that does not prevent an employer from being able to offer a figure below that, particularly if somebody is coming back into work and needs to be retrained or to improve his skills. Those are the two rigidities that we are trying to get rid of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the situation that the Minister is describing does not exist. He is saying that someone who may have been out of the work force for a year should not be able to turn down a job because it has not been offered at his old rate of pay. Surely that is the whole idea of the rules framework rules and of the practice that, after three months' unemployment, somebody should be expected to widen his horizons. As I understand it, there is no question under the present law of an adjudication officer accepting that after three months somebody can turn down a job because it does not offer him exactly the same terms and conditions as he has had before. The problem that the Minister has described does not exist as the law stands—yet again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, I do not see what the hon. Lady's objection is to us removing the concept of a rate of pay from the provision of suitability and simply including all the other provisions about suitability under the heading of good cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a world of difference between that being one of the factors that will be taken into account, with the adjudication officer judging, as he is now required to do, whether a job is suitable because it is not at the same rate of pay and saying that, no matter how inadequate the pay is, that will not be allowed to be a cause to object to being forced into any job. If the Minister cannot see the difference between those two things, I give up all hope for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>397</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall be going into all that in a great deal more detail under the next group of amendments about levels of pay and whether they should be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the existing law is that for up to three months, people can look out for a job similar to the one they had before, that after that they must accept any job and that the only limitation on taking away their benefit is that the rate of pay must be that of a decent employer in the area? That is the existing legislative framework. The Minister is now supposing that, after 13 weeks, people either have to take any job at any rate of pay, with absolutely no minimum standard, or lose their benefit. That is the change that the Minister is proposing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the good cause provisions that I mentioned earlier are retained. The employment service is anxious, in its advice and counselling to unemployed people, to try to match the unemployed person's skills and experience with available jobs. It would be nonsense if it did not try to do that on behalf of those seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister grasp our point? We should probably be happy if he was responsible for judging how the clause will operate, but he will not be. We want to know how it will operate in practice. It is one thing to say that people should be flexible about wages when they have been unemployed for a long time, but it is quite another so to change the balance that people will be pushed into any jobs, however deskilling. The wages for jobs advertised in the Birkenhead jobcentre are down to around £1 an hour. What protection is there to prevent the clause being used against people, so that they are told that such jobs are now suitable for them, given their periods of unemployment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the Minister to respond to that intervention, may I point out yet again that the next set of amendments relate specifically to levels of pay and wages. Some of the matters being pursued with understandable vigour under this set of amendments would be more relevant on the next set.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My other point about the employment service seeking to match available skills with those needed, is that, even beyond the permitted period, it would be possible for people seeking work to restrict their availability. Restrictions should not exclude people from the prospect of finding employment. People can continue to have restrictions, and adjudication officers will decide whether they are reasonable. As time goes by, and these people continue to fail to find work, they will be encouraged to widen further their horizons to try to get back into work. That is reasonable because people in employment have a better chance of getting suitable employment, either within the firm in which they are employed—if they have skills in excess of those employed on their current job—or by moving to
	<span class='label label-info column'>398</span>
another employer because they have a recent employment record. That point was made both by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, North-East and in the television programme, and I have experience of it myself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the Committee agreed that people in work have a better prospect of moving to another job. The longer a person is unemployed the more difficult it is to find work. Therefore, it is wise to encourage people as early as possible in their period of unemployment to take up jobs, even if they are not ideal, because they and their families will be better off, and their long-term job prospects will improve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me give the Minister an example. A skilled shipyard worker walking into the Birkenhead jobcentre will find that many of the jobs are for bar work. Are we saying that £l-an-hour bar work will increase that shipyard worker's chances of getting a job as a skilled tradesman? Will the clause be used against people who have acquired a skill, who are anxious that they should not be deskilled by unemployment and who are prepared to go on training courses to keep that skill intact and upgraded? Will such people be told that their chances of employment in shipyards, heavy engineering or any other engineering trades will be increased if they take jobs in bars and start pulling pints of beer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to explain that it would not be in the interests of the employment service immediately the permitted period was over, to say that someone with such skills should be expected to take a job in a bar. At the end of the day, the adjudication officers will decide, against the background of primary and secondary law. In such circumstances, after the permitted period, during which the individual fails to get back into exactly the same sort of employment that he had previously, the employment service would turn its skills to trying to find a job as close as possible to that held previously so that the skills of that individual could be used. It is in the interests of the individual and the economy that skills be put to proper use. It would only be if, after a prolonged period of unemployment, when horizons had been widened and still employment could not be found, that horizons would need to be widened still further. I cannot say that there are no circumstances in which it would be necessary eventually for a person to take the sort of job described by the hon. Gentleman. However, that would be at the end of a long process during which every effort would be made to find ways in which the skills that an individual had acquired during his previous working life could be put to use for work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Suitability protects people from being deskilled by unemployment. Skilled workmen have told me that taking unskilled jobs affects employers' attitudes to them and their skill. While they are more than happy to try to upgrade their skills with training programmes, they are pushed down the queue once they take an unskilled job, because there are many skilled tradesmen. I made clear earlier my views about the duties of people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>399</span>
signing on, trying to find work, or upgrading their skills. I have no argument with that. I am against removing this protection from people and going right against Government policy by using unemployment to deskill people. Every effort should be made to raise their skills. The Minister's response tells us how this part of the Bill will be used against our constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can think of nothing that would deskill someone more effectively than a prolonged period of unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is always straightforward and I always accept his experience of these matters, so I accept that in the past employers may have taken that attitude. However, Britain is quickly reaching a stage when skills will be in short supply. It would be folly for employers not to accept such people back into their work forces when they run short of skills because people have had the initiative and commitment to take unskilled work in the meantime. A shortage of young, skilled people coming into the work force is inevitable. Things will not turn out as the hon. Gentleman has described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the permitted period, it is right that good cause alone should be the reason for not taking up employment, and that the rate of pay should be disregarded. It should be possible for previous job experience and rate of pay to be taken into account for the permitted period of 13 weeks, and that is why the regulations allow for that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision will improve people's prospects and contribute significantly to the better long term use of skills in the economy. Therefore, I must ask the Committee to reject the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put another perspective to the Minister. He emphasised that he is interested in the person accepting the job. Does not he think that he has created an enormous loophole for the employer? In the light of his comments this morning, if I were an employer wanting to ensure that my costs are down, the market is more flexible, my profits are up and I can save money for investments, I should drop my wage rates to £1 an hour, and that applies to every industry and service. If what the Minister has said is true—I am questioning that—his Department will back up anybody with family credit, so that no one receives low pay, because it is all relative. In other words, there will be a direct state subsidy to the employers to carry a low wage economy. If he leaves the clause as it is, excluding the rate of pay, are not those, by default, the preconditions for our economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because the hon. Gentleman does not live in the real world of increasing competition for employees. In our own Department people whom we recruit and train can be offered more money and leave and go to work elsewhere, in the private sector. There is an increasingly competitive job market, in London and the south-east in particular. However, that experience is spreading wider. One has only to
	<span class='label label-info column'>400</span>
go to other major cities to see how that is increasingly becoming the case. It is not true that the clause will enable employers to depress wages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How does the Minister propose that staff employed in inner city DHSS offices in London find jobs for people when they are already working in areas with unemployment rates of over 20 per cent, in some cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the transport that there is in Greater London, travelling is not a great burden, although I know that the hon. Gentleman had some unfortunate experiences recently. People travel considerable distances to get to jobs in London. The fact that the level of unemployment in an individual borough may be at a given level does not mean that there are not plenty of job opportunities in the Greater London area. Our experience as an employer in Greater London underlines that heavily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not accept regional disparities? He has an obsession with the state of affairs in London. We are making law not just for London, though there maybe times when hon. Members might perhaps think that we should do that. On many Committees on which we have sat—such as the examining Local Government Act 1988—all we heard about were two or three small areas in London on the basis of which we were legislating for the whole of Great Britain. Yet again we see how the Government's judgment is distorted by their concentration on London alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said to the Committee earlier that the areas where unemployment has decreased fastest are those that had high unemployment in the past, including the country from which the hon. Member for Newport, West comes. In south Wales one can already see how the existence of the M4 motorway and fast rail communications are making employment prospects better than they were.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The times they are a-changing."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman should recognise that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Minister began appropriately with a Freudian slip, when he said that it was better off for people to be in work than out of work. I think that he meant that it was better for people to be in work than out of work. The point about the amendments and the clause is that whether or not people will be better off is irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that the economy will need all the available skills, which is why it was a good idea for people to be forced into taking any work, not just work that might be defined as suitable by present standards. The point that my hon. Friends made, and that my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) made very ably in the context of his own constituency, is that because we shall need skills, it is undesirable to force square pegs into round holes simply to fill a vacancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leeds, North-East talked about families, and the struggles within families to manage on low pay concerns us all. The Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>401</span>
dealt almost wholly with families for whom, although we deplore the low take-up, some in-work benefits are available. We shall debate their adequacy and the resulting problems on the next amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was amazed when the Minister said that many low-paid people live not independently but, in someone else's household. Of course they do and many more will do so in future. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that single people or couples without children do not qualify for any in-work benefits. They cannot afford to get accommodation elsewhere. Many will find it extremely difficult even to live in board and lodgings, if the Government push through the changes to board and lodging payments that they are contemplating, because they will no longer receive the money to pay the fees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen to families is of grave concern, but I am also worried about the enormous number of single people or couples without children who will be trapped in low-paid work, with the result that their prospects of marrying or having children will be almost non-existent. I recognise that that is partly a matter for the next clause. Unless the Government intend to distribute leaflets at family planning clinics saying how much better off people will be if they have children, a whole group of people will face difficult choices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State takes the view that it is morally wrong for people on low pay to have children. The hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) who is a Minister of State but not, thank God, at the Department of Social Security, has the most peculiar views on the circumstances in which people should be allowed to have children. Apparently, unless one is a member of the Church of England Synod and a Minister it is very dodgy to dare to add to the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also talked about people being able to look for work immediately after the permitted period. He does not believe that an automatic right to demand certain levels of pay should be allowed. We have returned to that point in a number of ways in this debate. That is not the law as it stands, and it is not what happens in practice. People are not allowed casually to demand a particular level of income and insist on staying on benefit unless that is offered to them. If they did, their benefit would be withheld. There is no need to change the law when the problem can already be dealt with if it arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister justified the removal of the word "suitable" from the legislation by drawing attention to the variety of ways in which good cause can be interpreted. He said that good cause for turning down a job might include difficulties with travel, childcare and so on. We can only presume that that does not include costs which make it disadvantageous for the person to take a job. That would mean taking into account the level of wages, which is specifically not allowed. This is not a matter of what regulations might say or how they might be interpreted by the sympathetic, delightful and highly-trained individual who will make these decisions at the counter—it is in the Bill. It does not matter what good cause or good justification people can put forward—if it
	<span class='label label-info column'>402</span>
reflects on the level or remuneration they can receive it appears to be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is all directed at a judgment of the person, whether it is good cause for him not to apply for or to turn down a job rather than whether it is the sort of employment opportunity he ought to pursue. The Minister said that employers should not be forced to recruit at wages which they cannot afford to pay, and that the rate for the job was an outmoded concept, clearly, then, a living wage is also an outmoded concept. I know of no legal provision that has ever existed to force employers to offer wages that they cannot afford. The most that can be said is that if employers cannot afford to employ someone at a decent wage, they must accept that they cannot have the assistance of that extra pair of hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, although the Bill will not penalise employers who do not pay wages that they cannot afford, it will penalise employees who do not accept a wage on which they cannot live. Anybody who knows rather than wildly imagining, what rates of benefit are paid will realise that the Bill could put people in circumstances where they are forced to accept wages that lower their standard of living compared to what they would receive on benefit. That may be because the cash amount is less or because they are worse off after the cost of travelling to work, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead, the Minister said that the Department would naturally try to match skills to job opportunities. I remind him that in a previous debate we drew attention to a case in which someone with research and teaching qualifications said that he would prefer a job using those qualifications. Earlier in this debate I mentioned someone who had undertaken training in computers and had said that he would prefer a job that used those skills. In both cases, those people were ruled to be not available for work because they were unduly restricting the work for which they were looking. So much for trying to match skills!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that those cases are exceptions and that they number only one out of a million. The Minister may be right in thinking that employment officers will do their best to match individuals' skills, capabilities and experience to job opportunities, but that is not what the Bill says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He even qualified that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill says that there is no need for employment officers to bother to match skills. They can if they like. If they are nice, charitable people and consider that that is an employment service's role, they could behave in the manner outlined by the Minister—we hope that they will—but nothing in the Bill compels them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Moreover, under the existing Secretary of State, or any future one whom the Prime Minister may appoint, officers who waste too much time worrying about whether they are matching people's skills to job opportunities might hinder their chances of promotion. Such action is not enshrined in law, but is simply the gloss that the Minister has put on it to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>403</span>
make it sound all right. Again, it is a question of the adjudication officer's judgment, discretion and feeling. Even if an adjudication officer is normally considerate, helpful, careful and seeks to match skills with jobs, he may take a dislike to an individual. The legislation will allow him to push that individual towards any job, no matter how inappropriate—to use the favourite Civil Service word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also suggested that, during the "permitted period", someone may enjoy protection similar to that which is enjoyed under the present law. However, even during the permitted period, someone could be forced to take a job in another district. The standards and conditions recognised by that district may be different and may not cover housing and travelling costs. The provision is alarming, as it seriously threatens people's long-term employment prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the fact that suitable work may, in future, be part-time work. When levels of remuneration are completely disregarded, people could be forced into low-paid, part-time work. Although the Minister said that people should use the opportunity of any kind of work to better themselves, the Bill seems to encourage the opposite. People who, after being forced into low-paid work, try to seek better work and take time off for interviews, stand a high chance of being sacked. They will then be disqualified from benefit for 26 weeks because of their misconduct while in a job that may damage their future chances. Yet their pursuing better employment would be more advantageous in the long term both for them and, in terms of skill development, for the economy, as the Minister recognised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my hon. Friend's point relate to the next set of amendments? Unless people have a guarantee that they will not be pushed into work that pays less than unemployment benefit, the part-time work ruling could be used against them to take any job with any pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It is particularly dangerous because people could be forced not only into part-time but also temporary work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The notes on clauses show that the Government intend to widen the definition of employment. They say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for instance, to include 'part-time' or 'temporary' employment."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had that in mind when I drew temporary employment to the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead. In previous debates we have, for various reasons, referred to part-time work, but we have tabled an amendment on temporary work. The subject has not yet featured largely in our debates. In previous debates we expressed concern that clause 7 may operate when no job opportunities are available. At first sight,
	<span class='label label-info column'>404</span>
clause 9 appears a little different, in that we are worried that people may be pushed towards jobs that exist, at least in theory. The interaction of clauses 7 and 9 means that, even though there may not be a vacancy, someone may be debarred from receiving benefit because of a potential vacancy. In the same way as people can rule themselves out of being available for work because they prefer to take work for which they are better suited, someone may be ruled to be not actively seeking work and not available for work. We should not forget that that also remains on the statute book. Perhaps the provision is: not actively seeking or available for work. It is swings and roundabouts. Employment officers can pick the category under which they wish to disqualify someone for benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Belt and braces.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The system must work like that. People will not be directed to actual jobs. Employment officers will say, "We know that jobs at £1 an hour are available in this area. You must stop calling yourself a skilled tradesman—or tradesperson."—	<i>[Laughter.]</i> People will be told the sort of work that they can do. The pincer movement—as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) says—will work, indeed must work. That must be the aim of the Bill, taking clauses 7 and 9 together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, my hon. Friend is right. I have been thinking this point through on my feet because I had not thought it through previously. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead said, under the law people can be asked whether they are prepared to take a job as a part-time barman at the rate of £1 an hour, or perhaps under market forces, 75p an hour. They may be inclined to express reservations about taking such a job and losing their entitlement to benefit. After all, they will not get it back for at least a month, even if they can prove that on every day they have been to every bar in town begging for a job at 50p an hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That bar job could be part-time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or temporary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it could be temporary or part-time. It might be a job working at Aintree race course. That is the sort of job possibility that arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister clarify the issue of work expenses? The Minister talked about good cause for refusing to look for or accept a particular job, and said that matters such as travel costs or wages could be taken into account. Perhaps that will be specified in regulations. Will the Minister confirm that although how far one has to travel or how difficult it is to get child care at a certain period of notice may be considered a good cause in theory, the provisions in the primary legislation mean that they cannot be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0247">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>405</span>
taken into account in considering the level of remuneration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about child care and travel. However, under other tests of availability for work, if a person is not available to take up work immediately, within 24 hours, because he or she is responsible for child care or not willing to travel an extensive distance, he or she is not counted as available for work. Therefore, I do not see how the Minister can give us assurances under this measure when such problems make people unavailable for work under other provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, but she must bear in mind how limited the Minister's assurances always turn out to be. He is not saying—perish the thought; he said in our previous sitting that he is far too old a hand to say—that people will be entitled to benefit because they cannot get child care at 10 minutes' notice, or because the travel-to-work distance is too great. I quoted a case earlier where someone was ruled to be unavailable for work because no public transport was available and he did not have a car.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing criteria mean that someone may be ruled unavailable for work, never mind actively seeking work, in such cases. The question of whether someone had good cause for not looking for a job or for turning one down might take into account travel and child care costs, if that person had not already been ruled unavailable. Some people may have managed to pass the test and not be ruled unavailable. That is a very small group of people but nevertheless they could have problems with wages or child care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong matters. However, if it is found that good cause for not taking a job includes responsibility for child care, under existing law the official would have an obligation to find that person unavailable for work. The official would consider that the person was not free to take up a job within 24 hours because he or she had responsibility for child care. The Minister's assurance on that issue is worthless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should I defend the Minister? Let him tell the Committee that his assurance is not worthless. It seemed possible that a group might have satisfied an adjudication officer about availability, despite travel and child care difficulties, because they had shown that they were able to meet those difficulties. Nevertheless for some it might be a problem in the context of even a theoretical job vacancy. My hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood may be right that no such possibility of "good cause" exists in that case. It is for the Minister to demonstrate that, not me. Apart from the issue of whether travel difficulties and child care responsibilities are good cause for not seeking or accepting a particular opportunity, we need to discuss its impact on remuneration. That may be what the Minister is saying, but it does not seem to us to be what the Bill says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady and I differ in our attitude to the role of the employment service. First,
	<span class='label label-info column'>406</span>
in my view, its staff are trained to be able to match people's skills with available jobs, which they will continue to do with commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the hon. Member for Derby, South asked about people being "forced" to take jobs at levels of pay that were below the level of benefit. That arrangement existed under the Labour Government, who made no attempt to stop it. In some cases decided by commissioners people had to take jobs at below the level of benefits to which they were entitled then. The real level of benefits in those years was lower than it is now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, the hon. Lady neglected to mention the availability of housing benefit as an in-work benefit to people in low-paid jobs. The hon. Member for Ladywood asked about part-time work. At present, people can take any part-time job. Under the clause we envisage that no claimant would be liable to suffer a benefit sanction for refusing to seek or accept employment, if the employment in question was part-time and for less than 24 hours a week. That would be a beneficial—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister say that again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the moment people can be required to take a part-time job or be liable to lose their benefit. In future, that penalty will apply only if the job is for more than 24 hours a week. That would be a beneficial, rather than a restrictive move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that at present people who are seeking a full-time job can be forced to take a part-time job, and that he will put in a base line to improve matters so that they cannot be forced to take a job of fewer than 24 hours. That is not how I understand the matter. People are not forced to take any old part-time work at present, which is why the people registered as unemployed are overwhelmingly people seeking full-time work, but who are overwhelmingly offered part-time work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the job is suitable the fact that it is part-time cannot be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A part-time job is not suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new system will contain the 24-hour provision. I would have thought that the Opposition would welcome that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Travel expenses and child care arrangements are complicated matters, and travelling costs could absorb an unduly high proportion of the wage. However, it would not be possible to give a precise figure, and certainly not possible to write it into regulations. It would vary according to the wage that was being paid, and what was left over for other purposes. I expect to see the adjudication officers and the employment service in general considering such problems with sympathy where low-paid jobs were involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lone parents with particularly difficult problems are not required to be available for work until their youngest child has passed the age of 16.

I can think of nothing worse for someone's long-term employment prospects—I use the phrase
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0248">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>407</span>
used by the hon. Member for Derby, South—than to be out or work for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that we differ about the purpose of the employment service. Of course we do not. We know what it is there for and we recognise that many people in the employment service do the job as best they can in extremely difficult circumstances. But under the Bill they will not need to do that at all. The Bill will allow them simply to get people off the unemployment register without any consideration of matching skills and so on. Our objection is not to the theory of how the employment service is meant to spend its time but to what the combination of employment and social security law allows, and particularly to the removal of safeguards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that it has always been the case that people might be forced into work even though they receive more on benefit. We accept that. However the Minister must accept that what he said about levels of benefit being higher now is absolute rubbish. I just mention in passing the earnings-related supplement to unemployment benefit. There were constant complaints from Conservative Members that benefits were much too high and that employers had difficulty matching them, as material recently published by the Department has shown. As a result of what the Government have done to benefits it is extremely difficult not to get more in cash terms in work than on benefit although whether one is better off depends on the net effect of all the changes involved in coming off benefit and going into work including factors such as travel-to-work expenses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that when I spoke about people in low-paid jobs who are not entitled to family credit I did not mention housing benefit. I did not mention housing benefit because I asked the Minister to tell us what benefits were available for people in work. Housing benefit is available to people who are unemployed. I did not mention it because it was not relevant, not because I had forgotten it. Someone who takes low-paid employment which lifts him slightly above the income-support level would start to lose housing benefit at a high rate of knots. With every £1 increase in wages I think he would lose 65p. That is part of the poverty trap to which we referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that people can now be forced to take part-time employment. We shall have to pursue that matter. I was looking through the legislation to try to identify the reference. Employment is certainly defined as
	<br><blockquote><p>"any trade, business, profession, office or vocation".</p></blockquote>
The notes on clauses are all that I can lay my hands on at present. They state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regulation-making power may be used to widen the scope of this definition to cover, for instance, 'part-time' or 'temporary' employment."</p></blockquote>
I certainly know of no examples of people being forced to take part-time work when they would prefer to look for full-time work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important matter. I am sure that the Minister did not do so intentionally, but he
	<span class='label label-info column'>408</span>
has misled the Committee. The word "suitable" in the present law prevents a person from being required to take part-time work. We are trying to prevent the deletion of that word. The job would not be suitable and the remuneration would not be fair. Once "suitable" is deleted people can be forced to take part-time work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not clear—this may be my fault, not the Minister's—about the answer to my question. Do work expenses relate to the level of remuneration which will be taken into account in the regulations or does the provision in the Bill that the level of remuneration must be disregarded override any question as to whether they are taken into account in the wages paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no straightforward answer, as I tried to explain. The employment service will decide whether good cause for not taking employment is its impact on domestic arrangements or undue travelling time. All such factors will be taken into account when determining whether there is good cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wriggling. He does not want to admit that the answer to my question is no. Whatever the regulations, or the Minister, may say about the factors that the adjudication officer will consider, the Bill says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there shall be disregarded any matter relating to the level of remuneration in the employment in question."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has praised the employment service highly this moring, but I am confident that he is not telling us that it will decide to disregard what is written in legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of the protection of the word "suitable" and the other protections in the definition of the word "suitable" in present legislation is a serious matter. It may be extremely damaging to people's long-term prospects of gaining employment that is right for them and that is beneficial to the economy. For that reason, I wish to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all want to comply with your advice and rulings, Mr. Winterton, but one of the problems of what you have just said is that the strategy of the Bill—and the threat and dangers lying behind it—is to force people to take low-paid work. As we oppose the Bill and expose the damage that it will do, we shall have to return to that issue time and again; it is the core of what is wrong with the Bill. If we wish to link amendments that might cause the issue of low pay to be raised, we may have to link all the amendments that we intend to move in Committee. I am not saying that that would be difficult; we shall have to return to the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is quite right. Obviously I shall permit reasonable discretion.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, Mr. Winterton. We have to balance whether it is better to have lots of amendments and perhaps lose a clause stand part debate or to have a clause stand part debate. It depends on the quality of the amendments. I think we did rather well when we moved amendments to clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 97 has been grouped with amendments Nos. 98 and 100. They establish some
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
sort of bottom line not for the wage levels that everyone in our economy should receive, desirable though that would be, but for the level of job remuneration available before someone can be forced off benefit for refusing to take that job. That is the purpose of the amendments, and there are different formulae for achieving it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Government will reject the amendments. They intend the Bill to lead to more people receiving even lower pay. The Minister should admit that. Presumably someone, somewhere has calculated the potential wage drag, and probably somewhere in the Treasury muddle there is the hope that wage inflation might be slowed down by cutting even further the wages of the poorest people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 97 provides that no one should be deprived of benefit for refusing a job that does not pay an hourly rate that is equal to the Council of Europe's decency threshold. I note that the Government have started to deny that there is such a thing as the Council of Europe's decency threshold. They deal with it by saying that it is not real.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain has signed a convention that requires us in broad terms to seek to reduce inequalities and that lays down a Council of Europe decency threshold. Experts advise all Governments about what that objective should be. We are advised to aim at everyone having a rate of pay that is equal to at least two thirds of average male earnings. I speak from memory, but I believe that that is correct. Everyone knows—that includes the Government—that that is the Council of Europe's decency threshold. We have signed a convention which has that aim, but the Government are clearly aiming in exactly the opposite direction. I think that in Britain the threshold would currently produce a rate of £146 a week, or £3.80 an hour. Those figures are not precisely accurate because I am again speaking from memory rather than from papers in front of me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seek to ensure that some limitation is placed on the degree of inequality in our country. The Minister thought that it was rather clever to say that someone will always be paid less than someone else, so that one could always argue that someone is low paid. Unless everybody is paid exactly equally—that will never come about and is not desirable—some people will always be paid less than others. But we call low pay a greater range of inequality than is thought tolerable in a civilised society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Council of Europe's measure of what is tolerable is two thirds of average wages, which comes to £146 a week. Conservative Members are ideologically convinced that low pay, free markets and competition are good things, and that any job is better than no job. They never think what it would mean for them, as individuals, to seek to budget and live on £146 a week. Their arrogance, and the distancing from so many of our citizens who live at that level, is such that they never pause to think how people manage to pay their bills, buy food, keep their house warm and look after the kids on £146 a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend knows, I have to go no on a Select Committee visit. So as I shall
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
not be here to pose this question, will my hon. Friend at some stage ask why, in moving towards an incentive-based society—with which I have some sympathy—the Government believe that to incite the incentive of those at the top, one must pay them more, but to incite the incentive of those at the bottom, one must pay them less?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I am sorry that he cannot be with us for the rest of the debate. I know that he has a particular interest in amendment No. 100. We may still be discussing it this afternoon, so I hope that he can be with us then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has pointed out the contradiction at the heart of the Government's economic strategy. According to them, more economic efficiency means the rich getting more money and being taxed less, while the poorer pay more in taxation—indirect, rather than direct taxation—and are squeezed into accepting lower wages that will somehow make them compete harder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 97 ensures that no one can be deprived of benefit for refusing to accept a job that pays less than £146 a week, or the hourly equivalent rate. It would not introduce a national minimum wage, but it would ensure that the state's benefit system is not deliberately used as an ally of the worst employers in the land. We are moving towards a situation where the state deliberately encourages employers who pay rotten wages to carry on doing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been listening with interest to the hon. Lady. Has she any figures showing how many people earn less than £146 a week, and how many would go on the dole if the amendment were accepted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) does not understand the structure of the amendment. It does not say that all persons must receive that rate of pay, otherwise they can claim unemployment benefit. It says that a person's benefit cannot be withdrawn if he refuses to take a job that pays less than that amount. In this country, about 9.8 million people receive less than that. Many of them—about two-thirds—are women, the overwhelming majority of whom are not entitled to benefit if they are without work because they live with a partner who has some income or benefit entitlement. That is an accurate answer to the hon. Gentleman's question, which showed that he misunderstood the intention of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 98 simply puts back in the Bill the provisions and framework that the Government seek to remove from the existing legislation. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Employment' in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) does not include employment at a rate of remuneration lower, or on conditions less favourable, than those generally observed in that district by agreement between associations of employers and of employees or, failing any such agreement, than those generally recognised in that district by good employers."</p></blockquote>
Within the present framework, people are allowed time—three months, I believe—to look for a job using the skills and offering the level of pay that they
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
previously had. After that time, they must look for any job, but that protection is available. The amendment would ensure that people are not forced to take any job at any rate of pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead has now left, but he would probably agree that under the Bill not only shipyard workers with high-level engineering skills who may be forced to work in bars or even in McDonald's. Many men in the west midlands spent their lives working in engineering. They were made redundant in the recession induced by the Thatcher Government in 1979, and have not worked for five or six years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is not listening, which shows the Government's respect for rationality. This is a game for the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to cross the hon. Lady, but I should have more sympathy for her point if she had not carried on a conversation while I addressed the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some fairness in that, but the Minister is responsible for the Bill. I am one Back Bencher on the Committee, but the Minister is responsible for the Bill. I am speaking to an amendment on an extremely important issue. The Minister represents the Government and must deal with my arguments. If he has a conversation that means that he is not listening, and he represents the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am listening carefully to the hon. Lady. She was advancing an extremely good case and has made a good point. I believe that the Minister has answered, so may I ask the hon. Lady to proceed in her competent way with the case that she is presenting?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful, Mr. Winterton. As they say, flattery will get you anywhere, and that is probably right on most occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the Government will not accept amendment No. 98, because the purpose of the Bill is to remove that provision. We want to hear why they want to remove it. What changes do the Government want to bring about in our labour market by removing the provision? They must want workers who have been out of work for a long time to take the sort of jobs that, up until now, no one would expect them to take. The car worker from the west midlands who has worked from the age of 14 to the age 55 in a skilled job will now be required to work as a cleaner, in a pub, in MacDonald's, or in a shop. That is what the Bill is about. That is what the Government want. The Government might think that such jobs are not normally done by men, but the difference between those jobs and the jobs that such men look for is the level of pay.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If there are to be interventions, hon. Members must stand up and seek to intervene in the hon. Lady's speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing wrong with being a cleaner, working in a public house or doing any other

sort of job. It is outrageous to suggest that such jobs be reserved people from some sort of lower order. That is disgraceful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is extremely interesting. I have worked as a cleaner and in pubs, but I bet that the hon. Gentleman has not and does not think that he ever will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My first job was washing up in a hotel where there was no washing-up machine. I did that for six months during the hottest summer this century. It was damned hard work, but I do not regret it. I should rather do that than go on the dole, as the hon. Lady would suggest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is fine. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has had that experience. I did such jobs when I was a student. I have never been on the dole and always managed to get jobs in the holidays. However, although my younger cousins do not go on the dole, they cannot now get jobs in the holidays. Things are not what they used to be. In the terrible 1960s, which Conservative Members denounce, we all worked and students did not claim dole. There were jobs to be had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend also remind the hon. Gentleman that there is a world of difference between a student choosing to do that for a short time and someone with skills which he prizes highly, and which are, we are told, prized elsewhere in society, a being forced to take such a job from which there is no escape and which may go on for years at very low levels of pay. Nobody is talking about disrespect for janitors or cleaners; we are talking about forcing people to take such jobs when there will, we hope, be better opportunities for them if they are allowed to wait.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, and that was the point that I was coming to. Skilled people who have been unemployed for some years in the west midlands tend to be men. Such a man will have worked hard all his life and developed a high level of skill. If he has tried extremely hard to get work after being made unemployed but is now 55 or 58, it is a disgrace and an outrage to force him to go and work in McDonald's. If the hon. Member for Stockport thinks differently, then the sort of respect that I have for men of that age who have worked all their lives and acquired skills is different from his respect. He may think that it is OK to push them to go and work in McDonald's, which they probably would not be particularly good at and where they would not be using their skills, for a rotten rate of pay. We have a rotten society if we do not have space for those individuals with the talents, skills, ability and dedication to be able to work with those talents and contribute them to society. So yes, there is deep disagreement between the hon. Gentleman and me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may take something different from the contribution of the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell). In some ways I might take some encouragement from what he said, because I thought
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
that I heard him describe rather passionately the conditions in which he worked. I have just been glancing back through the figures and it may interest him to know that hourly wage rates in the hotel industry have been declining, not increasing, over the past 10 years. My hon. Friend might like to suggest to him that he passionately take up the cudgels and oppose the abolition of the wages councils, which, rather than ameliorating the situation in the hotel and catering industry, will worsen it. I am glad that he appreciates the conditions because he will obviously support the people working in them, who are resisting the Government's attempts to abolish the wages councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is too romantic. He really believes that the hon. Member for Stockport would try to ensure that workers in the hotel industry who do washing up, as he did, should at least be paid as well as he was. I do not expect so much of Conservative Members, but my hon. Friend's faith is touching and sweet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 100 lays down that no-one should be forced to take a job that would offer less than the level of benefit to which that person is entitled. We had a little trailer, which you surprisingly allowed, Mr. Winterton, and the Minister told us that that has always been possible. Therefore, I presume, he will tell us that the amendment is unacceptable. Well, watch out, people outside this House. That means that people who get £34 or £35 a week to live on may be forced to take a part-time job paying less than that. Of course, that will not happen instantly to everybody—that is not the nature of such provisions. The Government are taking the legal power to do it, then there will be a process of tightening, and that is where we will end up. People who are genuinely looking for full-time work and bringing abilities and skills to the labour market will be forced to take part-time jobs that pay less than the benefit to which they are entitled under the Bill, unless the Government are willing to accept our amendment. If the Government will not accept our amendment, we should at least like some firm assurances on the matter because people will be very worried when they realise what the Government are up to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In much of our discussion and in his defence of the Bill, the Minister talks as if there are plenty of jobs to be had in the labour market and we just have to save the poor old long-term unemployed people who have been separated from the labour market—I suppose that one would call it a rigidity—and help them back into work. If they get some low-paid, low-level job they will be back in the active labour market and in time they might get a better job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The trouble is that there are not enough jobs in the economy for all the people who want to work. Much of the Government's rhetoric pretends that that is not the problem, but it is. In 1979, on the old figures, 1.2 million were unemployed. The Conservatives fought an election saying that that was too high, with the slogan, "Labour isn't working". Now, using figures collected in a similar way, 2.5 million are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0252">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
unemployed. We are nowhere near back to a level that they found intolerable in 1979. It is no good for Conservative Members to shake their heads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are repeatedly told that there are 700,000 vacancies in the economy at present, which is treble the number registered at jobcentres. Even on the figures that have been whittled down by the Government, whereby only those entitled to benefit are counted, there are still 2 million people unemployed. There are not enough jobs to go round and the jobs that exist are not distributed evenly across the economy. The labour force survey shows that more than 5 million people in Britain would like a job if one was available. Many are women and those seeking part-time work. Many people would like to work if the economy could provide jobs. It would be good for everyone if they could because that would create wealth for the whole economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are running the economy in this way for their own reasons, and it has led to a reduction in the number of jobs available. That is their responsibility but they turn their back on it. They are going to use the public employment service to force individuals into any old low-paid, part-time temporary job even though across the whole economy there are not enough jobs. There has been a major restructuring of the labour market under the Government. I have referred to it before and I do not wish to repeat those arguments. However, I simply want to list the series of measures that the Government have taken to encourage the development of low-paid work, so that no one can pretend that this is an accident and that the free market has just led to a growth of 2 million more people who are low paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government got rid of the fair wages resolution and schedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act 1975, which laid down conditions that when people were bidding for public contracts with local or central Government, the contracts were not given to those who simply cut wages to submit a cheaper bid. That was a good idea, approved of by old fashioned Toryism, but it has gone now. They have removed young people from the protection of wages councils and reduced the amount of protection available to adults. A couple of years ago, I sat for hours in this very Committee Room and Ministers gave us firm assurances that they were reforming the wages councils, not abolishing them and that our amendments showed our paranoia. What is happening now? There is consultation on getting rid of wages councils completely. The Government have no honour. They give their word and two years later rip it up and do the opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have skill shortages in our economy becuase we have such a rotten training strategy. The money that the Government put into what they call training is really put into schemes, such as the youth training scheme and the various adult programmes, which seek to lower wage expectations in the labour market. That has done massive damage to what training schemes could have done for the unemployed. The decrease in the rate for people on YTS, as the Government have failed to uprate it, compared with
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
what used to be paid to young unemployed people under the youth opportunities programme, represents a massive, and effective, cut in income. All the studies show that over that period, young people's wage expectations have been reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Lady is advancing a most interesting case, but I find it difficult to relate it to any of the three amendments under consideration. Could she be a little more specific in her remarks in relation to the amendments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to explain how my remarks relate to the amendments. They are about not using the clause to withdraw people's benefits if they refuse to accept a job with extremely low pay. We are trying to put up a barrier so that people will not be forced into accepting low-paid employment. Part of the reason why that is undesirable is connected with the Government strategy of encourging low pay. The measures in the Bill are part of a long line of deliberate acts that have restructured the economy and encouraged low pay.

I have already mentioned the fair wages resolution, schedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act 1975 and wages councils. The special programmes for the unemployed are used not to train them but to lower their wage expectations. I said that the YTS strategy had been successful. Job creation programmes for adults, which paid about £140 a week at current rates, were replaced by special temporary employment programme paying £120 a week. Then there was the community programme, which became part-time work paying £67. Now the Government are trying to force the adult unemployed to work for £10 on top of their benefits. This is all part of the lowering of wage expectations, so that if people are on a scheme, a job that will make them a little better off is acceptable, even if it offers a much lower rate of pay than would have been acceptable previously.

Then there has been a series of schemes to subsidise employers on condition that they pay an extremely low wage. The cheek of that extraordinay concept is unbelievable. On the young workers scheme, employers get £15 a week towards young people's wages provided that they were paying them less than £40 a week when the scheme was first introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we have the extraordinary jobstart scheme, which pays £20 a week subsidy provided that someone takes a job paying under £90 a week. The subsidy lasts only six months, then it runs out. It has not been a particularly successful scheme, but it is also about trying to get people to accept low-paid employment.

The other major part of the Government's strategy is connected with privatisation. For example, cleaning jobs in the Health Service and in local government have been put out to private contractors. The shift has been to get the same people, or fewer of them, to do the same job for a lower rate of pay without any entitlement to holidays, sick pay, and so on. That has also led to a cut in wage levels.

What I am saying is relevant to the amendment. The Bill and the clause are part of a long-term strategy that has restructured our labour market significantly.

We have seen a phenomenal growth in low-paid work, which is deeply undesirable in terms of people's dignity and income. To be told that family credit is available and that one third take it up does not reassure me. I am distressed at the thought that the state subsidises rotten employers. If we are to subsidise industry, we should subsidise efficiency by investing in training, rather than giving a huge subsidy to rotten employers who pay lousy wages, which is what family credit amounts to.

The Bill and the clause are a further move down that road. The provisions are bad for the individuals affected, and bad for the economy. A strategy of competition by wage cutting will not take the economy forward. Plenty of other countries have lower levels of income and wage expectations. If we are trying to compete with those countries, we are on a downward path. The only hope for our economy and our country, for justice and equality, is a highly-skilled, highly-trained work force and a high investment economy. However, we are taking the opposite route and without the amendments the Bill will make matters worse. Their acceptance would mean that the state employment agency was not acting as an agent for the worst employers in our land and forcing workers to take rotten, low-paid employment. As the Government intend to use all their influence in all the agencies under their control to encourage low-paid employment, I fear that these amendments will not be acceptable to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood. I hesitate to follow her speech. All Opposition Members, and I am sure that many other people throughout the country know that for years her campaign for those on low pay has been tireless. I compliment her on that. Her speech reflects her work in that area over a long time and her expertise and contribution should be acknowledged.

I was disheartened this morning when the Minister came out with the phrase "all relative" in relation to the low-paid. I have here a letter that was sent to all hon. Members by the Locum Group which said that a ceiling was being imposed
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the fees that medical employment agencies may charge hospitals."</p></blockquote>
It specifically refers to wage rates. Hon. Members will be surprised to hear what some refer to as low pay, and the kind of figures that my hon. Friends the Member for Ladywood and for Birkenhead and
	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>
myself have referred to this morning. The letter goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These imposed rates are very low and the agencies are unable to pay highly skilled doctors who work for them a reasonable hourly wage for their expertise. The percentage commission allowed by these rates makes it impossible to run a business profitably ... junior agency doctors were paid an hourly rate varying from £7 to £10 per hour depending on the grade and with individual variations among the agencies.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>This rate is very poor remuneration for a skilled professional when the services of a ... photocopier engineer will cost over £50 per hour ... Britain is a free country and it is morally wrong to impose a ceiling on a skilled professional's services which should be left to market forces and commercial considerations."</p></blockquote>
It is an interesting remark. Obviously there is some question of relativity. Some feel that they are poorly paid at a rate of £10 an hour when the rates to which we have referred have been around £1 an hour and upwards.

The Government calculate by averages all the time. By doing that they give the impression of allowing those at the top to feel that they are in touch with those at the bottom. That is the purpose of computation by averages. If the Minister is saying that pay depends on the average—he refers always to the average wage—I ask him to check with the Department of Employment. It suggests that some wage rates have not increased in line with the average but have been held back. Some, particularly at the lower end have been cut in Britian during the past financial year. Some workers have found that they get less, not more, in their pay packets at the end of the week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, it is not true to say that the whole economy is shifting upwards in relation to wage rates. Some of the low-paid find that their wages are going down, so their pay is not locked into a moving-up average. Although it may be true that the average in general is moving higher, that may be because those at the top are getting more. At the same time those in the bottom deciles of the economy and wage rates may have found that their wage rates have been held level or are actually being cut. In other words, the economy could be going in different directions in relation to wages at the same time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
