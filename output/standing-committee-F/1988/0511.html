<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>Pesticides (Fees and Enforcement) Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><i>Motion made, and Question proposed.</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That during die proceedings on the Pesticides (Fees and Enforcement) Bill the Committee do meet on Thursdays and Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—<i>[Mr. Ryder.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Home Robertson <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Lothian)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a longstanding tradition in Committees attended by Scottish Members that we debate the sittings motion at some length. I was a little unnerved to hear the Minister refer to Tuesdays and Thursdays in the plural, although we should be thankful that he did not refer to 4.30 in the afternoon as well as 10.30 in the morning. However, as the second Reading debate on the Bill took place in a Standing Committee, by agreement with the Opposition, in particular with my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies), and as that debate lasted for fully 17 minutes, we might try to beat that this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is good news.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<div class='clause'><span class='label label-warning'>clause</span>
Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
PAYMENTS FOR GENERAL PURPOSES OF PART III</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr. Richard Ryder)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 2, line 19, leave out from 'payable' to end of line 24 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'by any person in respect of an approval is unpaid, the Ministers may suspend the approval, until that amount is paid, to such extent as they consider appropriate and, without prejudice to the generality of this subsection, to the extent that it authorises him to sell the pesticide.'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have looked at my amendment paper, and that amendment is not selected, [hon. Members: "It is."] I see. Hon. Members are looking at me as if I have done something wrong.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have often had the privilege and pleasure of serving under you, Mr. Leadbitter, and I have never in my life known you to do anything wrong.<br><br>
I signposted during the short debate on Second Reading held in Committee that I would move the amendment. It corrects an imperfection in the text of clause 1 that was not identified prior to publication. In clause 1(1), the new section 18(7) of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985, known as FEPA, on page 2, line 19, allows Ministers to suspend a consent in relation to a pesticide in respect of which a fee payable under section 18 is unpaid.<br><br>
In fact, "consents" under the Act are general in nature and apply to all pesticides, whereas "approvals" are specific to each pesticide. Rather than having a power to impose a suspension of a consent in relation to a particular pesticide under the proposed section 18(7), therefore, it is more logical for Ministers to have a power to suspend an
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
approval in relation to that pesticide, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) will acknowledge. It would also be desirable to ensure that only the defaulter is penalised, and to avoid penalising any merchant or user who had previously purchased stocks.<br><br>
Accordingly, the Government amendment to the proposed section 18(7) would enable Ministers to suspend an approval, rather than a consent, in the circumstances described in that subsection and insofar as the approval relates to the sale of the product by the approval holder. It would not prevent merchants or users who had previously purchased the product from selling, storing or using it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are always keen to encourage the Government to improve imperfections, as the Minister put it, although with this Government that could take some time.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the purpose of the amendment. I was concerned that traders, farmers, or owners of other businesses who had stocks of previously approved pesticides could fall foul of the withdrawl of the approval under the provision. But the Minister has made it clear that the intention of the amendment is to ensure that the penalty is targeted on the producing company that is in default of the necessary fee.<br><br>
On the understanding that the amendment would make the legislation operate fairly, I do not think that we need to protract the discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I confirm that that is the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Vivian Bendall <span class='memberconstituency'>(Ilford, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to clarify a point with the Minister. I have had a good deal of correspondence with the British Agrochemicals Association. Is my hon. Friend happy that its concerns are largely dealt with?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am largely content that the BAA's concerns have been met. I had a brief talk with the association and have corresponded with it. Of course if there are changes that it wishes to make, Ministers are always prepared to meet the association. On this Bill, it has been properly consulted by myself and my officials.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I invite the Minister to say a word about the purpose of clause 1.1 want to repeat a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) on Second Reading, which may be echoed by the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Bendall) who, we understand, is acting on behalf of the British Agrochemicals Association.<br><br>
We must ensure that fees are set, applied and collected fairly. Indeed, one or two companies have made representations because they are worried that a blanket levy could bear unfairly on some small companies and producers. It probably does not make sense that a company that produces a particular product should pay through its levy a contribution to the testing fees for the products of other companies that may be in competition with it. Will the Minister address himself to that point?<br><br>
The National Farmers Union has stated that under the Bill, the production industry—the agrochemicals industry rather than the farming industry—will pay the full cost of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0008">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
the testing procedures. Therefore, surely it is not too much to expect higher standards and quicker delivery of the service. I understand that there has been correspondence between the industry and the Parliamentary Secretary, Baroness Trumpington, about the problems in operating the scheme because of staff shortages and excessive costs. If the industry has to pay for the whole thing, surely it is entitled to expect higher standards. Will the Minister advise us on that?<br><br>
I invite the Minister to deal with the continuing review of approved pesticides. The Department issued a press release recently stating that a routine review of pesticides was taking place. I was somewhat disturbed to read table 1 of that press release which Listed 36 products subject to review. Eighteen of those reviews had been completed, of which no fewer than 11 approvals had been revoked and two had been restricted. Therefore, 72 per cent. of completed pesticides reviews have led to the revocation or restriction of the issue of those chemicals.<br><br>
That is a matter of concern. That means that standards are changing and that what was acceptable some years ago is no longer acceptable—but that is another matter for a separate debate. The question must be whether the continuing cost of reviewing these chemicals is to be covered by the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is correct in saying that the industry expressed anxiety that the process of monitoring approvals was not being undertaken as quickly as it should be. During the past six months my noble Friend Baroness Trumpington, the Minister responsible for pesticides, has done her best to ensure that the pace at which these pesticide applications are monitored has been accelerated.<br><br>
As the hon. Gentleman knows, every pesticide must undergo a detailed process to be approved for use in the market. It takes some years for pesticides to come on to the market. I take the example of a pesticide that has been developed by ICI. ICI must establish tests for mammalian toxicity on mice, rabbits, rats and so forth, for ecological toxicity on birds and fish; and for residues in food. It must test how pesticides affect crops and the fate of those pesticides in the environment. ICI continually considers the implications of those tests for carcinicity and teratogenic threat to unborn children, and it measures to what extent the toxicity of the pesticides is dangerous.<br><br>
As soon as those tests have been undertaken—that may take from two to five years—the results are sent to Harpenden, if they concern agricultural products, or to Bootle, if they do not. At Harpenden, scientists employed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food examine those studies and if they feel that the pesticides are safe for use, they go to the scientific sub-committee of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. The scientific subcommittee is composed of IS scientists, leading figures in their field. They receive not only the company's results, but the conclusions reached by employees of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at Harpenden. They judge whether the pesticide application is good enough for it then to be sent on to the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. The Advisory Committee on Pesticides is made up of leading doctors and scientists in that field and is chaired by a professor from the London hospital.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
At each stage of the sifting process a significant proportion of the applications are rejected. It may be necessary to submit an application several times before it is accepted, because all the time Harpenden, the scientific sub-committee and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides are looking for improvements in those pesticides. My reason for explaining that process to the Committee is to provide assurance that the Government's monitoring process, which has been in operation under successive Governments, is effective and is regarded in Europe as one of the safest and most objective.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Lothian also asked me to explain in greater detail the background to the clause. He may recall from reading the <i>Official Report</i> that I cut short my remarks on Second Reading for reasons which will be known to his hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr Davies). It may be helpful to the Committee if I now explain some of the background.<br><br>
New section 18(1) empowers Ministers to set a fee for the approval of a pesticide and to charge that fee to the applicant for approval. It is slightly more specific than the corresponding original provision of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 in stating that the fee is a
<br><blockquote><p>"contribution to the cost of handling and evaluating applications",</p></blockquote>
rather than a charge
<br><blockquote><p>"in respect of the administrative expenses of processing"</p></blockquote>
applications.<br><br>
New section 18(2) empowers Ministers to require payments from approval holders or applicants for approval in respect of three different types of expenditure. Paragraph (a) requires payments in respect of the balance of any costs which are attributable to the handling and evaluation of applications but which are not recovered under the fee provided for in subsection (1). This is a new provision. Paragraphs (b) and (c), which stipulate the other two types of expenditure in respect of which payments may be required—the collection and processing of information supplies under section 16(11) of the 1985 Act and the monitoring of the effect of the use of pesticides— correspond to existing provisions of the original text of section 18(3)(a) and (b) respectively. As a result of the new section 18(2), Ministers will be able lawfully to use the revenues generated by the levy on approval holders' turnover in order to meet the costs of evaluating applications which are incurred before any approval has been given, as well as those which arise after that stage.<br><br>
Members of the Committee may wish to note that the provision set out in section 18(2) of the original text of the Food and Environment Protection Act, which enables a Minister to charge a further fee for carrying out examinations or tests considered necessary in order to determine whether approval should be granted, has been dropped from the new text. The need to use that provision has not arisen so far. Were it to arise in future, the costs concerned could lawfully be funded out of the levy on turnover under paragraph (a) of new section 18(2).<br><br>
New section 18(3) corresponds to the original section 18(4) and requires the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State jointly to obtain the approval of the Treasury to the principles according to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0009">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
which the amounts paid under section 18 are determined, and to carry out prior consultations about those principles with appropriate trade organisations.<br><br>
New section 18(4) specifies that the Minister, acting jointly, may calculate any payment required under section 18 by reference to the United Kingdom turnover of a pesticide to which an approval relates, or to the United Kingdom turnover of all pesticides to which approvals held by the person who is to make the payment relate, or both.<br><br>
That is a new provision. It does not, however, confer any new power on Ministers, but rather explains more specifically the system which the Government operate for the collection of the levy. The inclusion of subsection (4) follows a precedent set in legislation concerning medicines, under which a levy scheme also operates.<br><br>
New subsection 18(5) provides that the Minister may use any method of calculation that they consider reasonable to determine amounts which are due to be charged under the system of levy on turnover referred to in the previous subsection, but which cannot be so charged because no evidence, or insufficient evidence, of turnover has been supplied.<br><br>
New subsection 18(6) empowers either the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or the Secretary of State to permit payments under section 18 to be phased, amended, set off, waived or refunded in appropriate cases.<br><br>
New subsection 18(7) empowers Ministers acting jointly, to suspend a consent to doing anything concerning a particular pesticide which is contrary to a specified prohibition in cases where an amount payable in respect of an approval for that pesticide is unpaid. It also requires that such a suspension shall be discontinued as soon as the sum in question is paid.<br><br>
We have reflected further on subsection (7) since the Bill was published and concluded that we must have the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is now referring to the substance of the amendment. How will it operate? We understand why the Minister wants to penalise people who do not pay the levy, namely, the agricultural chemical pesticides producers, but the Minister said that the revocation of the approval of the chemical in question would apply only to the producer who is in default and that anyone else with stocks of the chemical can carry on marketing and using it. How on earth does that work? How will enforcement officers, local authorities or the Health and Safety Executive identify which pesticide containers may be used under the let-out clause and which will be subject to the embargo? Either the approval stands or it does not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) mentioned "the amendment". We are debating clause stand part.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am making is that the clause itself is an amendment to the principal Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point and I shall come to it in a second. I have a note attached to my old papers, which I planned to use on Second Reading to answer that question.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
New section 18(8) specifies that payments made under section 18 are payments for the general purposes of part III of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 and may be used accordingly. The general purposes of part III are defined in section 16(1) of the 1985 Act as including the protection of the health of human beings, creatures and plants, the safeguarding of the environment, securing safe, efficient and humane methods of controlling pests, and making information about pesticides available to the public.<br><br>
New section 18 will enable us to implement fully the type of funding arrangements that we have had in mind all along, but that is not to say that all the features of those arrangements remain unchanged. The funding division between the fee and the levy—by which 90 per cent. of revenue is met from the levy and only 10 per cent. from the fee—should not be regarded as immutable. Some larger companies in the pesticide industry are known to favour a higher fee and a lower levy. We have been discussing that with the British Agrochemicals Association and other representative organisations in the pesticide industry.<br><br>
It should not be assumed that the current structure of application fees will be immune from change. It is clear, for example, that the minimum £50 fee will have to be raised substantially as, at present, it is hardly more than a token sum. The other two levels of fee currently charged will also have to be re-examined.<br><br>
Some notes on fees and levies that I had on Second Reading set out clearly what we are doing. Section 18 of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 gives Ministers powers to recover the costs of approving pesticides under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 and some of the monitoring information collection work that the Government undertake relating to die effects of the use of pesticides. These are levied on those applying for approvals and approval holders in two stages.<br><br>
First, there is an initial charge levied on all applicants for approvals. There is a range of fixed charges and a charge is incurred, depending on the type of application and related to the type of approval being sought. For example, there is a charge of £7,000 on an application for a provisional approval which would entail the first commercial sale of a new active ingredient as a pesticide. That figure would be applicable to a firm such as ICI. Secondly, there is a figure of £50 for registration of a product, identical in composition to one already approved or provisionally approved, where the product is not intended for commercial distribution. That applies to farmers, for example, for registration of off-label uses which do not entail submission or evaluation of new supporting data.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies <span class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am puzzled by one point. The Minister referred to a fee of £7,000 and said that it would apply to companies such as ICI. Is he suggesting that it is not a flat fee and will be £7,000 only when it is levied on the larger companies, or is he saying that there will be a pro rata application?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. As the hon. Gentleman knows, one of the main purposes of this short Bill is to ensure that those who submit applications pay the full amount. Because of an imperfection in the 1985 Act, it was felt that we were about £600,000 short of the money needed to cover those costs. That was due to a drafting defect. I think that the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) was a member of the Committee on that Bill and that on Second Reading he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0010">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
said that he had not spotted it. I confess that, had I been a member of that Committee, I should not have spotted it either.<br><br>
The third category to which I should refer is that of merchants or small firms. The figure is about £250 for all other approvals or provisional approvals, including amendments to approvals not covered by either of the two earlier categories to which I referred.<br><br>
We are anxious to ensure that these levies are not set at figures which deter some small firms from submitting applications. If they had to bear too high a cost for applications, some might be tempted to circumvent the system and that would be potentially dangerous. Pesticides might be used that had not been properly monitored and approved.<br><br>
I referred to the registration department at Harpenden. Is it in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, West (Mr. Jones)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert B. Jones <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hertfordshire, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Not quite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Harpenden and Bootle, where the registration departments are, assess each application when it is received and tell the applicant the amount due. Applications are not processed until payment of the appropriate sum has been received.<br><br>
The application levy is an annual levy on each approval holder based on the percentage of his turnover in approved products during the year. It is calculated by setting the levy to make up shortfall between receipts from initial charges in the costs of running the approval system and carrying out the monitoring work during the year. For the annual levy, companies are required at the beginning of each year to submit accounts of their turnover in approved products during the preceding calendar year. Levy is payable only on sales made through United Kingdom-based customers. Total costs, which may be offset by the levy, are then calculated as a percentage of the consolidated industry turnover figure. Each approval holder or nominated alternative must pay that fixed percentage of his turnover.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Lothian asked about the £7,000.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that when I read that in <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow it will be clear to me, but I have to say that the Minister's reply did not seem to answer my question. Is the figure of £7,000 to be a flat fee? Does he realise the impact that that will have, particularly on small producers? Does he realise that fees of that size, which are prohibitive to small companies, could hinder research into new pesticides? Given the pressure being applied to the industry generally for pesticides that are more environmentally friendly, does the Minister recognise the danger that such research could be held back by fees of this kind? Will the Minister give a general undertaking that he will continue his consultations and monitor the impact of these fees on the industry to ensure that the research and new development that we want to encourage is not hindered by the application of these fees?</span></p>
<p>>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a legitimate point, with which I entirely agree. It is imperative that we keep in close touch with the industry, and with other people—environmental groups, for example—who are concerned about the matter. It is important that smaller
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
companies, and individuals in particular, should not be prohibited by price from going through the system. As more people become aware of the potential dangers of pesticides, it is crucial for the Government to keep in touch with all interested parties. I fully accept what the hon. Member for Caerphilly said.<br><br>
I understand that the £7,000 is for the new active ingredients only; that is to say, the research-based companies deal in such substances. The hon. Member for East Lothian asked about reviews. Reviews of the older products to date have had a high probability of leading to withdrawal, for the reason that they were largely emergency reviews, where there was serious concern. Often the concern was confirmed by the review, and the product withdrawn. The new programme relates to routine reviews, and there is no expectation of withdrawals as a result. The ACP and others have been looking at particular pesticides as emergencies rather than at a broad total of all pesticides in use.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was a piece in this morning's <i>The Guardian</i> on giving advice to farmers, which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"farmers must stop contaminating food with pesticides... Public concern for human health and the environment is also manifesting itself increasingly in demands for organically-grown produce. I personally view it as a way for you to rip off the customer by charging more for identical produce."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister confirm that that is not the view of his Ministry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be referring to the excellent speech made last night by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment. Nothing in that speech was in any way inconsistent with what my Ministry believes, nor was there anything that had not been said before.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are deeply grateful to the Minister for confirming that it is the policy of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, as well as of the Government, to encourage farmers and others to rip off the customer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. This must not stray out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was rather good, though.</span></p>

ENFORCEMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 deals with enforcement. It would be useful if the Minister said something about that matter. Points have been made to us on the slight confusion about the machinery that is used for enforcement. Is it to be the responsibility of the Minister himself, presumably in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, or of the Health and Safety Executive, or is it to be farmed out to local authorities?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0011">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
It would be useful if we had a clear, concise explanation from the Minister as to what machinery the Government intend to put into operation following the amendment to the principal Act, in order to ensure effective and fair monitoring and enforcement of the standards set down in that Act.<br><br>
I am disappointed that you were unable to select amendment No. 3, Mr. Leadbitter, but during the stand part debate we may be able to say something about the costs of enforcement. The Government have a bad reputation for their habit of laying more and more duties on local authorities, at the same time as reducing the funding available to those authorities to carry out their statutory duties and other responsibilities. We are debating another responsibility that may be delegated to local authorities; the monitoring of standards of pesticides under this legislation and the pecticide trade. The Bill provides for the Minister to collect a levy in fees which is supposed to fund that operation, will he give us a clear undertaking that local authorities will have a share of the income in order to do the work?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Caerphilly (Mr Davies) talked of the Secretary of State for the Environment's reputation as the cowboy of the present Administration who is not above ripping off local authorities from time to time. We should like confirmation that the monitoring will be done well, becuse the public expect it to be done well and the industry will be paying for it to be done well. The Minister must tell us how he will operate the system, what the role of local authorities will be and how they will be reimbursed for doing the job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 2 corrects one of the provisions originally set out in the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 which lacks the desirable degree of precision in its effects. In this case the subject is the enforcement provisions included in Part III of the Act.<br><br>
Under section 19(1) of the 1985 Act Ministers may authorise what are described simply as "persons" to be enforcement officers. In the context of the section, that only encompasses what in legal terms are known as "natural" persons and not what are known as "legal" persons. The definition of "legal person" includes corporations which in turn cover local authorities, health authorities and so on.<br><br>
The fact that those bodies are not capable of being designated as enforcement officers means that only individuals can be authorised by name. That would mean individually naming the official dealing with the inspections at each local authority. Such a list would run into hundreds and would require constant updating and additional bureaucracy. Moreover, local authorities are known to be reluctant to have their staff nominated as the servants of central Government, and as local authorities currently have no responsibilites for enforcing part III of the 1985 Act, they cannot incur expenditure on its enforcement. That has been a major drawback in integrating local authorities in the process of enforcing pesticides control.<br><br>
Cause 2 of the Bill aims to put matters right by enabling local authorities to authorise members of their staff as. enforcement officers in categories specified by Ministers. At the same time, it retains Ministers' power also to authorise their own officials.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Clause 2(1) amends section 19 of the 1985 Act by replacing subsection (1) with a series of new subsections numbered (1), (1A), (1B), (1C) and (1D). New subsection (1) is in turn divided into paragraphs (a) and (b). New subsection (l)(a) gives enforcement powers to any person whom Minsters authorise by means of an instrument in writing. New subsection (l)(b) gives enforcement powers to any officer of a local authority who falls within the description of local authority officer specified by Ministers, provided that the local authority concerned has authorised that office by means of an instrument in writing.<br><br>
Subsection (1A) provides that an intrument of authorisation issued by Ministers under subsection (1)(a) may provide that the person so authorised may exercise the powers specified in that authorisation only.<br><br>
Subsection (1B) provides that Ministers may specify the descriptions of local authority officers who may be authorised by local authorities under subsection (1)(b). It goes on to provide that Ministers may specify that such an officer may be authorised to exercise those enforcement powes for specified purposes only. It is expected that environmental health officers and trading standards offices in local authorities will be specified, following consultations with local authority organisations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister anticipates that it will either be trading standards officers, who in Scotland are employed by regional councils, or environmental health officers, who in Scotland are employed by district councils, who will be specified. I do not know what the position is in England and Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Counties and districts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is therefore' a fairly fundamental question. Will the Minister tell us whether it is to be trading standards officers, who are employed by regions or county councils, or environmental health officers, who are employed by the districts?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Trading standards officers, environmental health officers and the Health and Safety Executive all have responsibility for ensuring that pesticide legislation is properly maintained. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) asked about resources and funding and I shall deal with that specifically and tell him about a meeting that took place with the local authorities and other interested parties, including environmental health officers, after I have gone through the background.<br><br>
New section 19(1C) empowers local authorities—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who does what? I apologise for interrupting the Minister, but it is a fundamental question. The industry and local authorities would like to know what is in the Minister's mind. Which category of local official is to have the responsibility? Will it be the Ministry, the Health and Safety Executive, the counties' and regions' trading standards officers or the districts' environmental health officers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the meeting that took place two weeks after Second Reading, which I again signposted during the debate, it might be helpful if I explained that to the Committee. Trading standards officers have responsibility for retail outlets, environmental health officers have responsibility for how people use pesticides in gardens, and the Health and Safety Executive and the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0012">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
Ministry's own officials can go on to farms, as indeed can environmental health officers. The enforcement authorities, who met my officials and officials of other Departments, including the Welsh Office and the Department of the Environment, on 16th March in order to discuss the resourcing implications, were all satisfied that the delineation of responsibility was clear as a result of the original Act. I understand that there have been no complaints at all from the enforcement authorities. That was a question that I myself asked of my officials, who are the experts on this, before the Committee, and I was informed that the local authorities were content with the arrangements suggested in the new legislation.<br><br>
I shall deal in detail with that meeting in a few seconds.<br><br>
Subsection (1C) empowers local authorities to authorise for enforcement purposes, such of their officers as fall within the description of local authority officer specified by Ministers under subsection (1).<br><br>
Subsection (1D) limits the powers of any person authorised under subsections (l)(a) or (1)(b) in carrying out the functions specified in the remainder of section 19 of the Food and Environment Protection Act to those to be detailed in that person's instrument of authorisation.<br><br>
Subsection (2) of clause 2 inserts a new subsection (8) into section 19 of the Act. It defines the meaning of "local authority" in the new section 19(1)(b).<br><br>
New subsection (8) sets out a definition that includes
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) any local authority, as defined in the Local Government Act 1972, except a parish or community council".</p></blockquote>
The definition also includes a regional, islands or district council in Scotland, a district council in Northern Ireland and a port health authority.<br><br>
Subsection (3) serves to retain in force those authorisations already issued to officials of Departments and of the Health and Safety Executive—the latter via an agency agreement with the Health and Safety Commission.<br><br>
In view of the interest of the hon. Member for East Lothian in what is a key part of any pesticide legislation, that the enforcement regulations be properly drawn up, it might be helpful if I described in more detail some of the enforcement operations and explained how the charges brought about by the Bill will work in practice.<br><br>
At the moment, the Health and Safety Executive is empowered under the Food and Environment Protection Act to enforce the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986, made under the Act. The executive's authority runs to those premises for which it is responsible under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. That ensures that businesses are not subject to enforcement action by different agencies for different aspects of their operation. In practice, it means that there is routine inspection of farms, of local authority activities and of certain distributors' premises.<br><br>
Enforcement action takes many forms. When approached, inspectors issue formal notices under part m of the Food and Environment Protection Act and may prosecute offenders. While there is a satisfactory level of activity by the government in relation to the most significant uses of pesticides, we should like to see more in the areas of responsibility where local authorities usually enforce safety legislation. At the moment, for reasons that I explained earlier, there are no local authority officers authorised to use the powers under part III of the Food and Environment Protection Act and to enforce the Control of Pesticides Regulations. In some cases, local authority
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
officers can nevertheless take enforcement action, but they lack the powers to serve enforcement notices and might have difficulty in collecting evidence for prosecutions.<br><br>
Until such time as local authorities take up the enforcement powers under the Food and Environment Protection Act, as it will be amended by the Bill, the Government are dealing with the complaints that fall outside the Health and Safety Executive's remit. For example, in the last year my Ministry dealt with more than 40 cases of alleged contravention of the rules relating to advertising, sale and supply of pesticides.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
I promised the hon. Member for East Lothian that I would refer to the meeting that took place in London a couple of weeks after Second Reading. Present at the meeting were representatives of the Association of District Councils, the Association of County Councils, the Association of Port Health Authorities, the Institute of Environmental Health Officers, the Institute of Trading Standards Officers, the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland, the Welsh Association of District Councils and the Welsh Association of County Councils, the Health and Safety Executive, the Department of the Environment, the Welsh Office Agriculture Department and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<br><br>
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the implications of the Bill for the enforcement authorities, and I understand that they were satisfied that no additional expenditure would be incurred from the legislation. The hon. Member for East Lothian is understandably anxious to ensure that the enforcement authorities are properly staffed and resourced. The new legislation will not have any additional resource implications for the authorities represented at the meeting on 16 March.<br><br>
At the end of that meeting, an official inquired whether the local authorities and other enforcement authorities would like a further meeting before implementation to discuss whether they had any doubts about anything, including some of the points raised by the hon. Member for East Lothian, but they stated that they did not want another meeting and would leave it to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to decide whether one was necessary in future. I may then allay the hon. Gentleman's fears, because the enforcement authorities were clearly reassured at that meeting that no additional expenditure would fall on them as a result of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but I am now slightly more confused. The Bill says that Ministers shall have power to
<br><blockquote><p>"specify descriptions of local authority officers who may be authorised to exercise the enforcement powers",</p></blockquote>
and
<br><blockquote><p>"If either of the Ministers specifies a description of local authority officers under subsection (IB) above, a local authority may by instrument in writing authorise any of its officers"</p></blockquote>
to do certain things.<br><br>
Parliament is giving Ministers power to designate categories of local authority officials to do the job. But now the Parliamentary Secretary says that there will be no additional costs for local authorities. That does not add up. Either those people will have a job of work to do or they will not. If they have a job of work to do it will cost someone money.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0013">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
The Minister's assurance seems a little unconvincing, therefore, although if he tells me that the local authorities themselves are happy, I must accept that. Perhaps he is implying that the final duty will rest with the Health and Safety Executive and that when designated local authority officers come across instances of contamination by pesticides of water courses, wells and so on, or find empty or damaged containers of apparently unauthorised chemicals lying around in their dumps or at roadsides, they should simply pass the information on to the Health and Safety Executive, which has the expertise, equipment and information to do the job. If that is so, I understand it.<br><br>
The clause says that local authorities will have extra duties at the behest of the Minister, but he is now telling us that it will not cost them any more. He sounds more and more like the Secretary of State for the Environment: local authorities must do the work, but they will not have anything to do it with. Perhaps he can explain how he can square this circle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is no additional cost because the work will be done as part of the existing business and surveillance. If prosecutions result and costs arise in that respect or for training, it will be calculated as part of the rate support grant. We do not believe that training or litigation will cost too much. Those are two areas where there may be a miniscule amount of additional expenditure, but that will fall on the RSG.<br><br>
There are four or five main points on the clause stand part debate. No extra expenditure on enforcement will arise as a result of the Bill's passage into law, although there may be a little on training.<br><br>
The major part of local authority involvement in pesticide enforcement activity arises in connection with the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986, made under the 1985 Act. Local authority representatives have told MAFF that enforcement of those regulations does not involve extra staff resources, and they have acknowledged that the appropriate route for them to use in seeking such small extra expenditure which does arise, for example through training and litigation, is via the rate support grant. The magnitude of the extra expenditure over the United Kingdom as a whole is less than £10,000 annually. Under those circumstances no transfer of funds from central Government is considered necessary or appropriate.<br><br>
When local authorities are asked to take samples on an ad hoc basis in connection with the enforcement of the Pesticides (Maximum Residue Levels in Foods) Regulations they will continue to be compensated by the Ministry, as at present. That is the reason why the Government cannot support the amendment. There is no need for the amendment because no extra expenditure will be incured except on training. The cost was calculated at £10,000 a year—I am corrected—the figure is not £10,000 but £100,000 a year. The figure of £100,000 is not high enough for us to feel that any costs should be borne by central Government. They should be borne through the rate support grant as is usual in these circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It comes as a considerable relief that inflation has gallopped at 10 per cent. and that we have moved from £10,000 to £100,000 within a matter of seconds. It would not have been credible that a budget of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
£10,000 nationally could possibly cover the training and resource work involved. It is still questionable whether £100,000 will go far enough.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the pesticides residues document which we debated in another Committee in the same Room yesterday. We discussed the fact that pesticides residues were being discovered in water courses and freshwater fish, eels and so on. I cannot imagine that a district council's environmental health officer, whose principal job is inspecting local retail outlets, restaurants and kitchens to ensure that there are no health hazards, will either have the expertise or the equipment required to sample water from obscure water courses and to analyse the tissues of eels to find out whether there are traces of banned pesticides. Presumably the Health and Safety Executive officials from the Ministry's laboratories will take over when necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may be helpful if I remind the Hon. Gentleman how the work on residues is undertaken. Speaking from memory, I think that the idea that we should establish monitoring of post-approvals for residues and pesticides stemmed originally from the Labour Government in the 1970s.<br><br>
The working party on pesticides residues carries out selective monitoring of food and wild life, which I know that the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) is interested in. Samples are also taken from retail stores all over the country and sent to a central laboratory, which employs about 50 to 60 full-time professional analysts. It undertakes to analyse between 2,000 and 3,000 samples a year, for which the budget is £1 million. It has been and is expanded all the time. It was expanded throughout the 1980s. I think that it was a Labour Government who set it up in 1976.<br><br>
The results of the work of the WPPR is published every three years. The latest report came out two months ago. All the work of the working party is analysed by the Food Advisory Committee and the Committee on Toxicity, which are made up of independent scientists, medical people and other experts who advise the Government whether or not to suspend or withdraw particular pesticides in view of the residues left in food. The details of their work were published and are available in the Library.<br><br>
The work on pesticide residues also incorporates the wildlife investigation scheme, which I am sure that the hon. Member for Caerphilly knows about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You will be relieved, Mr. Leadbitter, to hear that I do not intend to debate clause 3.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member had better not.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Home Robertson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee much longer. I am genuinely grateful to the Minister for the details that he has given us of a subject on which there is universal consensus. Everyone is concerned about the need to monitor and control pesticides, to understand them and to ensure that unsafe compounds are kept off the market and out of circulation. This is one of those rare and happy occasions when Government and Opposition Members are at one.<br><br>
The only niggle at the back of my mind is how effective these provisions will be. I say that with the benefit of some experience in the agricultural industry. One does not need to be a farmer to know how accessible these chemicals are. One has only to go to any garden centre, garden shop or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0014">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
out-of-town supermarket where products of this kind are available. People with no training can get hold of fairly dangerous chemicals, use them in their gardens and leave half bottles or half containers lying around, which are then thrown away sometime later. When the containers are punctured or poured out, potentially dangerous compounds go into circulation which may be dangerous to human beings, to the environment or wild life.<br><br>
We want this sector to be controlled effectively and fairly. This minor legislation is intended to improve the performance of the enforcement agencies and to ensure that those making a profit out of this business meet the cost arising from the monitoring and enforcement exercise. It is a small step in the right direction. Clearly, a certain amount more will need to be done from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ryder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to thank the Opposition Front Bench for its kindness and generosity for permitting this small piece of technical legislation to be debated in Committee rather than on the Floor of the House.<br><br>
I share the views of the hon. Member for East Lothian on pesticides. As he says, one does not have to be a farmer to be aware that pesticides are hazardous and dangerous if they are not used properly. He knows, too, that I should like to reassure the Committee that the monitoring process undertaken by the Government, that I have described this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
morning, is of the highest order. The men and women responsible for monitoring the applications and the approvals of pesticides are leading figures in the medical and scientific fields, who carry out voluntarily an excellent job on behalf of consumers.<br><br>
I share the hope of the hon. Member for East Lothian that the Bill will be effective, and believe that it will be.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
Many people in the industry are worried about data protection. We are in touch about ways of improving matters and I look forward to further consultations on data protection, which I know is of great interest to those in the industry, as it is to me.<br><br>
I thank you, Mr Leadbitter, for chairing the Committee with your usual good humour and brevity, I hope that you will enjoy your cup of coffee as much I shall enjoy mine.</span></p>
