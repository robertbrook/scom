</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the Bill, the clause is squalid and wretched. Our amendments intend to give some semblance of order and rationality to the Bill, if we are not able to introduce any fairness and justice to it. I wish to speak about the clause generally, before speaking to our amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause changes the regulations about the repaying of unemployment benefit after a period. The present rule is that once unemployment entitlement has expired after the 52-week period, a person must be unemployed for 13 weeks to requalify. The requalification period does not have to be consecutive—the 13 weeks can be spread over a longer period. Clause 8 states that the 13 weeks must be within the 26 weeks preceding the new claim.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Could I help the hon. Gentleman, who has been extremely constructive throughout our debates? If he talks widely on the clause when we are dealing with specific amendments, that would influence my decision on whether to allow a clause stand part debate at the end of our deliberations on amendments. To be helpful to the hon. Gentleman, I suggest that he directs his remarks specifically to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall abide by that guidance, because I am sure that we shall wish to have a clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We tabled amendments Nos. 76 and 77 because of the change in the notes on clauses, which states that the clause is intended to:
	<br><q><p>"establish a closer link between working and the payment of benefit."</p></q>
That profoundly changes the existing arrangements. We wish to consider the logic behind that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
Amendments Nos. 77 and 78 deal with the problems of self-employed people who now are not covered by unemployment insurance. It has always been assumed that a person who becomes unemployed after a period of self employment should not be able to claim unemployment benefit. Clause 8 transforms that assumption. The existing rule—that the 13 weeks which requalify an unemployed person for benefit can be spread over an unlimited period—is a contribution test, rather than a test of attachment to the labour force. The amendments are built on that distinction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until 1975, a person requalified for benefit by paying 13 weeks' contributions. It was not a matter of work experience. The abolition of the flat rate national insurance contribution for employees in 1975 made it necessary to base the test on hours worked rather than contributions paid. The underlying assumption is that someone who works for 16 hours will have earnings above the lower earnings limit and will therefore pay contributions for that week. As a contributions test, it was logical that the rule should require 13 weeks' work as an employee because only employees' national insurance contributions carry entitlement to unemployment benefit. Clause 8 converts the test from the contributions test to one of recent member of a labout force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should people who have proved themselves to be active members of the labour force by working for themselves for three months or more not be allowed to requalify for benefit in the same way as people who have worked as employees for the same period? There is a case for extending employment insurance to self-employed people generally, but that is not the real point of the amendment. The amendment is aimed at the person who, after a year or more without a job, sets up in a one-man or one-woman business and fails to make a go of it and becomes unemployed again a few months later. There is a case like that in my constituency: the person set out on what seemed a promising and worthwhile enterprise but it did not work out. Part of the Government's philosophy or mythology is to encourage self-employment and new enterprises like this in the belief that protozoan self-employed people will one day turn into another ICI. The amendment is germane to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure will not apply to people who have always been self-employed. There is a strong argument for excluding them. To qualify for benefit under the provision, people will have to have worked as employees for long enough to qualify for unemployment benefit and to be unemployed and actively seeking work for long enough which is at least a year, to exhaust their benefit entitlement. Why should someone who has managed to work for 13 weeks on a self-employed basis not be allowed to requalify for benefit in precisely the same way as if he had found work as an employee and lost it again after 13 weeks?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may argue that the amendments would in some cases enable a person to claim unemployment benefit after several years of self-employment, but that would be prevented if the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
principle in the amendment is accepted and a new amendment is tabled on Report to provide for a maximum period of self-employment after which entitlement to benefit would cease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 82, which follows in our usual impeccable and logical course, would extend the definition of employed earner. Under section 2 of the Social Security Act 1975 an employed earner is defined as
	<br><q><p>"a person who is gainfully employed in Great Britain either under contract of service, or in an office (including an elective office)"—</p></q>
that presumably includes hon. Members—
	<br><q><p>"with emoluments chargeable to income tax under Schedule E".</p></q>
Now that, under clause 8, the requalification test is to become a test of recent attachment to the labour force, it no longer makes sense to discriminate against people who have done their 13 weeks outside Great Britain. We do not want the Government to be accused of being xenophobic or Little Englanders on this issue. If one accepts what we are saying in amendments Nos. 76 and 77, there is no justification for discriminating in that way. Amendment No. 82 would remove that meaningless discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle that the Government want to establish is that unemployment benefit claimants have a recent work record, if we understand the clause and the notes on clauses correctly. Provided that they can show that the work that they have been doing is of a king that would have been classified as employed earners' employment in Britain—that is, they were working for a wage or salary—it would not matter where it was done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming back my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fallon)—who has disappeared again—after the birth of his first child. We shall congratulate him when he returns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Should we not give him some time off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason for my remark is that he has already taken some time off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer to the amendments rather than to the clause, as I noted your observation, Mr. Winterton, to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) all three amendments are intended to widen the definition of employment for the purpose of the requalification test. Amendments Nos. 76 and 77 would remove the term "employed earner" and thereby bring in the self-employed. Amendment No. 82 would allow a person to requalify by virtue of employment outside Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To consider the amendments properly, we have to look back at the purpose of unemployment benefit which has always been linked to class 1—employed earner's—employment. Self-employed people are not covered for unemployment benefit and pay a reduced rate of contribution to reflect that position. One of the main reasons for that is the difficulty of assessing whether they are truly unemployed on any day and,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
if so, whether that is a matter of choice or necessity. No Government, no matter what party is in power, has seen fit to change that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newport, West said that he saw no reason for changing that wholesale, and that people who normally earned their living through self-employmewnt should not become entitled to unemployment benefit. His case lacked logic and consistency and that is why it is difficult for the Government to accept the amendment, especially as presently drafted. I advise my hon. Friends to vote against it if it is pressed to a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requalification test is there to demonstrate that, after a prolonged period of unemployment of at least 312 days, a person has returned to the labour market in a consistent way. The requirement that the weeks of work for the requalification test must be weeks of employed earner's employment follows from the reasons for restricting payment of unemployment benefit to people who have been in class 1 employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment No. 82, people have always had to return to work for an employer in Great Britain to requalify for benefit. To change that would open up the ability to requalify not just to the self-employed, whose employment status may be questionable or difficult to check accurately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I see some force in the hon. Gentleman's points. It would be easy to check on work abroad for which class 1 contributions were paid. The regulations that we shall make under the clause would extend the 26 weeks. We are willing to consider whether they could be extended for people who are working abroad for 13 weeks—or even part of that period if they have other work in this country to make it up to 13 weeks—and are paying class 1 contributions. However, I cannot accept the amendment proposing that the work abroad should qualify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a small concession to he hon. Gentleman, I shall consider the matter carefully. I should like to include people who have proven work abroad, at least in extending the 26-week period in those circumstances. Will the hon. Gentleman withdraw the amendment, so that I may do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would both have to rise then, but in my case, it would not make much difference in size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he would not accept the amendment, but that he would do something with the proposal. Will he do that by using regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Let me make it clear that I have not said that this proposal will appear in regulations,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
but I should like to consider whether it can. That is different from accepting the amendment. The amendment would ensure that work done abroad would qualify for the 13 weeks. I would be prepared to consider the way we might include work abroad as an activity that would enable the 26 weeks to be extended. There is a power in the clause to make regulations to extend the 26-week period for people in certain situations. Working abroad could be one of those situations. I should like to do that, if it proves possible and policeable, because everything comes back to administrative practicality as well as desirablility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the news of the happy event of the hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Fallon). We look forward to him joining the group of Tory rebels who will support the new clause on child benefit when it is presented on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was a probing amendment. As is often the case, the probe has discovered a vacuum, although perhaps that it is little unfair this time. We welcome the Minister's reasonable words about reconsidering amendment No. 82.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were trying, as always, to be constructive and helpful. We hoped to avoid being accused of suffocating the entrepreneurial spirit that will resuscitate our economy, according to the Government. I am happy to withdraw the amendment, and possibly return to the issue later. I look forward to the Government producing something that will build on amendment No. 82.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In drafting new legislation, curing one injustice often creates others. In this case, in creating an injustice, the Government are creating several more. That is likely to happen if amendments Nos. 76 and 77 are disregarded. Nevertheless, we welcome the Minister's comments on amendment No. 82. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 78, in page 5, line 27, after "weeks", insert
	<br><q><p>"at least four of which are".</p></q>
The amendment would ensure that in the requalification conditions of clause 8, within the 13 weeks stated, at least four would come in the immediately preceding 26-week period. At present, as long as a person puts in 13 weeks, it does not matter over what period those weeks are worked. As clause 8 stands, the 13 weeks work required to requalify for unemployment benefit would have to have taken place within the past six months, instead of at any time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clause 8 states that this move:
	<br><q><p>"will establish a closer link between working and the payment of benefit."</p></q>
It does not say how that will be affected, but it states that that is the intention. I went further, and looked at the other notes on clauses provided for Conservative Members—the background notes for Members of Parliament on the Social Security Bill published by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
the Conservative research department. There we find the slightly more illuminating explanation of what lies behind the notes on this clause. They state:
	<br><q><p>"Clause 8 will in effect demand better evidence of an intention to return to work by those who have already received a year's benefit."</p></q>
It seems that—as it says at the beginning of the notes—the whole point and purpose of clauses 7, 8, 9 and 10 is to put into effect the promises made by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security—as he was then—and the Secretary of State for Employment during last year's Conservative party conference to tighten the rules relating to unemployment benefit and income support for the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes to Conservative Members go on to state that unemployment benefit
	<br><q><p>"is only paid for 312 days (ie a year minus 52 Sundays which do not count for UB assessment purposes). To requalify for UB, a person must 	<div class='u'>now</div> <!-- u --> have worked for at least 16 hours of each of at least any 13 weeks at any time before the next claim; this requalification test is 	<div class='u'>in addition</div> <!-- u --> to the normal qualifying conditions."</p></q>
I must add that in the text that I have, the words "in addition" are underlined and I wonder whether that is as if to say that the Government have to create the impression—certainly to the party—that they are doing something. It may be quite minimal, but if they underline the words "in addition", they might create the impression that it is a great act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes go on to state:
	<br><q><p>"From autumn 1989, this criteria of 16 hours in 13 weeks must be satisfied in the 26 weeks immediately preceding the claim."</p></q>
They add a useful note. They state:
	<br><q><p>"Currently, 13,500 people requalify every year. This proposal will mean about 3,400 will fail to qualify."</p></q>
Will the Minister spell out the number of people who will be affected by the change and the savings that will be made? Is there a major change in Government policy or is this a minimal adjustment to create the impression of real change and the impression that the rules are being tightened up when the practical effect of the change will be that it will hit a minority of people, but hit them hard?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading, the Secretary of State used half a sentence to gloss over the clause. He merely reiterated the notes on clauses booklet. He said:
	<br><q><p>"The Bill strengthens the link to recent work in. the test for requalifying for unemployment benefit in clause 8".—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 10 January 1989; Vol. 144, c. 720.]</p></q>
That is the notion of strengthening the link between recent work and benefit. I do not know whether simply using the word "strengthens" is intended to strengthen the link, but to try simply to tighten up the weeks qualification seems to be a petty way to strengthen the link to recent work. No doubt the case for it is that in a small minority of cases it is possible, under the present rules, for someone who has not been in regular work for many weeks to requalify for unemployment benefit after clocking up the required 13 weeks. The Government's figures—if those are the figures in that research department document, I should like them to be confirmed—show that the number of cases is very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The saving in benefits resulting from clause 8 could be estimated at about £2 million a year, most of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
which would not be a real saving because it would be offset by £1.3 million additional expenditure on means-tested benefits anyway. It is almost a cosmetic change to create the impression of tightening up the rules. In practice, it simply eliminates a few people, because £2 million is the approximate cost of paying unemployment benefit to around 1,000 people. However, most of those 1,000 people will undoubtedly be people whose 13 qualifying weeks occurred within that last year or so, although it may not have been within the past six months. At most, a few hundred people who have not worked more than two or three weeks during the past year will be caught by the clause. Most of those affected by it will be people who have been continuously available for work and who will have taken every opportunity to seek work whenever it was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is passed, clause 7 will still remain, so people will still have to fulfil the conditions of actively seeking employment. Since that is built into a previous clause, why is this clause necessary? Our amendment would prevent clause 8 from hitting people who have a significant recent record of employment, by providing that four of the 13 weeks required to requalify for the benefit must have taken place within those 26 weeks. That is a reasonable proposition, and the cost of accepting it minimal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1979 I think that there have been 12 Acts dealing with social security. Small provisions are built into each to try to tighten up the system to exclude people from being able to obtain benefit. That is a parsimonious, if not petty aproach, to public policy. I urge the Minister to say that it is not necessary to tighten up procedures in this way. This is a reasonable proposition, and the cost would be minimal. However, I do not believe that that is what the Minister is worried about. If the purpose and tone of the Bill is to tighten up the system, it should not be at the expense of those who are doing their best to find work and be available for work, and who find themselves caught up by rules over the number of weeks, when it is difficult to apply those rules in individual circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is a useful change that links requalification for unemployment benefit more firmly to a sustained period of recent work.

This amendment would mean that to satisfy the requalification test, a person would be required to work 16 hours in only four of the last 26 weeks
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>322</span>
before claiming unemployment benefit again. The remaining nine weeks of work could be at any time since he last received the benefit. Rather than ameliorating the purpose of the clause, it would negate it, and would leave matters as they are now. In changing the requalification test, we intend to make a more sustained return to employment necessary in order to requalify. Such a return is needed for those who have already had a year's unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment would be that, when those people requalify, they would be entitled to another year's unemployment benefit. It is reasonable to require that, at least in between, there should be a reasonably consistent return to work over a limited period of time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to believe that people move from unemployment to full-time relatively permanent work, and back again. I should like him to give me the Government figures and statistics to demonstrate that people move from unemployment to temporary part-time and low-paid work, which could be casual. That would certainly damage the pattern of people moving to a full-time job, which would have severe implications if the law were to be changed. The tightening effect would make matters difficult for people who move into low-paid but temporary part-time and casual work. How can the Minister resolve that in the context of his proposed changes?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have changed only the time period of the test, not the test itself. It is 16 hours a week over 13 weeks, which is part-time. We have deliberately kept it that way, so that it would not exclude people who had temporary, part-time and low-paid jobs. We wanted not to make a contribution or wage test, but to ensure that those people to whom the hon. Gentleman was referring are included and able to requalify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the amendment would not satisfy the intention of the clause. I do not think that many people, apart perhaps from Opposition Members, would consider that four weeks' work in a period of six months showed a consistent return to the labour market. Therefore, ably and passionately though the hon. Gentleman introduced his amendment, I must ask my hon. Friends to reject it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of that reply, I shall press for a Division. The Minister is right to suggest that the amendment would leave the situation as it is, which is as it ought to be, and that I was giving the impression that it was a toughening move by the Government. The Minister used the phrase "iron heel". The impression of toughness is there, but in effect the measure is not tough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a measly way to introduce clause 8. The Minister has given us no figures. Unless he wishes to intervene and say what the savings to the Government will be or how many people will be affected by the proposal, the present figures show that it will not be a vast horde. If the Minister is not

prepared to reconsider, I shall have to press the matter to a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly respond to a couple of the hon. Gentleman's points. As I said, he is not clear in his own mind whether this is a harsh measure or a measure that has little or no effect. It is a useful small measure that tightens the link for requalification for unemployment benefit to a more consistent return to the labour market than under present rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the present figures, the hon. Gentleman is right. The rules will probably affect no more than 3,500 people, depending on how unemployment trends go, how job opportunities emerge and whether the change will act as an incentive for people to find part-time work and the jobs to enable them to requalify. It could have that beneficial effect. I hope that it does. No one will lose by it, and some claimants will gain from the extra incentive it gives them to return to the labour market more consistently, more quickly. As it is a useful and constructive element in a Bill that consists largely of useful and constructive, though small but reasonable measures, I recommend the rejection of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are trying to make the clause less confusing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause requires someone to have worked for 13 of the previous 26 weeks to requalify, but the 26-week period is either 26 weeks ending on the date of the new claim, or
	<br><q><p>"if he would not requalify by reference to that day"</p></q>
the 26 weeks preceding the first day of the present or most recent spell of unemployment.

The meaning or effect of the words
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
	<br><q><p>"if he would not requalify by reference to that day"</p></q>
are not wholly clear. I do not wish to strike dread into the Minister's heart, but it would be helpful if he could explain those words and give us an assurance that the effect of paragraph (b) is beneficial to claimants, and not to the Department. We understand it to mean that, if a person would have satisfied the 13-out-of-26-test at the start of his or her present spell of unemployment, but did not immediately make a claim—which may be for a variety of reasons—that person will not lose entitlement because some of the 13 working weeks no longer fall within the past 26 weeks. If that interpretation is correct, the words
	<br><q><p>"if he would not requalify by reference to that day"</p></q>
are unnecessary because anyone who satisfied the 13-out-of-26-test at any time during a spell of unemployment must have satisfied it at the beginning of that spell. If the words are unnecessary, why not remove them? If the words are necessary, will the Minister tell us why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) is right to say that the words read curiously to the layman and that Bills should not contain superfluous words. She is also right to assume that the omission of those words would not cause claimants to lose benefit. The words were included so that the tests can be applied in an orderly manner. If the claim is not made on the day, the official will apply the test under subsection (2B). Therefore, the words are not entirely redundant, as they assist the logic of the rule's application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision allows for a delay in claiming because of good cause. As she suggested, there could be many such causes, and the clause allows them to be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perish the thought that we should allow the Government to pass legislation that would enable tests to be applied in a disorderly manner.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause requires that 13 weeks' work are carried out as an employed earner before requalification for unemployment benefit. The amendments would make weeks spent on an approved training course count towards those 13 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether it is reasonable to ask the Government to make such an amendment depends on why they are making the changes under clause 8. The say that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>325</span>
they are making them not for actuarial reasons but so that people can show their commitment to actively seeking work. If that is so, and as the Government exclude from the unemployment figures people who are on training courses, it seems right to reward people on approved training courses by counting their efforts as entitlement to unemployment benefit. After all, they are showing determination to find work and willingness to spend time on low income schemes, which provide a much lower level of skills than most unemployed people require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Entitlement to unemployment benefit matter very much to people whose partners have incomes. In many tragic cases, men or women—men often feel it more personally—with working partners find themselves redundant or unemployed. I was surprised that the Minister was so dismissive of cases mentioned under amendment No. 76, as many of those people may try to set up a small business, and to take a place on a training scheme. They will be lucky to qualify, as people whose partners have work are not entitled to a place on a training scheme or even on an enterprise allowance scheme, because one must be on benefit to qualify. Having tried their best and come to the end of that scheme, they will find that if they are not entitled to unemployment benefit they will have no entitlement to any benefit. The issue is partly about money, but it is also about dignity. Many members of couples, especially the men, find it painful and humiliating not bringing in any income when they are doing their best to retrain or find work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my advice bureau on Friday, I saw such a man, whose marriage is breaking up. He made this bracelet for me. I do not normally accept expensive presents, but as he made it, I thought that it was legitimate to do so. He used to be a jeweller, but was made redundant in the big recession in the west midlands. He tried to set up business as a self-employed builder. That went wrong, and he got into debt. He is now struggling to get on to an enterprise allowance scheme, but is not allowed to because his wife is earning, although she has a fairly low income. Those trials and tribulations have broken up a long-standing relationship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not simply a technical proposal. We are not simply asking for more for unemployed people. The Government's position is that people must show their determination to find work. People who go on training courses are showing that determination. Therefore, in cases such as those to which I have referred, the Government should, in logic and humanity, say that 13 weeks on a training course counts towards an individual's requalification for unemployment benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) seemed almost to argue that anyone actively interested in getting back to work should be entitled to unemployment benefit permanently, and that there should be no limit or restriction. I got the impression that the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
Lady would apply no limit to people who seriously wanted to find a job again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not arguing for that, although I am sure that there is a case to be made for it. I was talking about people who have paid their stamps in the past, and how much they need to pay to requalify for unemployment benefit. Those who go on schemes for 13 weeks, as opposed to getting back into the labour market, should be included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Lady is forgetting that we are talking about people who have exhausted their year's entitlement to unemployment benefit under the arrangements that have existed under this and the previous Government. Such people have already been drawing unemployment benefit for the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already explained, the purpose of restricting the requalification test to employed earner's employment has always been to show a sustained return to the labour market. Clause 8 strengthens that test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two amendments seek to extend to people in training the ability to requalify for benefit. I am not clear what is meant by the use of the word "approved" in amendment No. 80. That would apply specifically to the youth training scheme. I do not suppose that the hon. Lady wishes to narrow the clause to cover just those on the youth training scheme. That would be particularly inappropriate, as the young people involved are not entitled to unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is our view—here I agree with the hon. Lady—that every encouragement should be given to people to take advantage of the many opportunities available for employment training. We have always attempted to ensure that when people take up a training place, their benefit rights are protected and they are not disadvantaged. We shall do that in relation to requalification by using the power under subsection (2B), which places a duty on us to introduce regulations that would enable the 26-week period for requalification to be extended for people in particular categories and particular situations. Time spent on a training scheme would certainly count as such a situation. However, I cannot accept that time on a training scheme should be counted the same as work for an employer, and thereby represent part or the whole of the 13 weeks necessary to requalify for unemployment benefit. The regulations will ensure that none of the 26 weeks is lost in that ability to requalify. So for people on training schemes, the rules will remain much as they are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment as drafted. I am not sure that the hon. Lady would want me to, in that its effect is far more narrow than she expected. However, we are proposing to ensure in regulations that those who go on training schemes do not lose out on any of their entitlement. For those who have already received a year's unemployment benefit, the 26 weeks will be extended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It sounds as though something slightly good is going on, but I am not absolutely clear what. Is the Minister saying that people who have received
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
unemployment benefit for 12 months and exhausted their entitlement, can go on a training scheme and will be credited with the equivalent of national insurance stamps for 26 weeks, so that if they work thereafter for 13 weeks, they will then be entitled to unemployment benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points to consider. If we forget the "approved" training scheme reference in the amendment, and just consider it as applying to training in general, it would mean that unemployed people would gain credits for national insurance as if they were in paid employment. In other words, training would count the same as a job in paid employment. I believe that that is the intention of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not accept that training, although valuable, can or should be counted as a return to the labour market. Because we applaud, approve of and encourage people who take up training as a way to gain extra skills and make a return to the labour market easier and more certain, and so that they and the community will benefit, the period of training will not count against the 26 weeks in which they have to establish 13 weeks of work to requalify for unemployment benefit. We shall do that not by amending the Bill but by introducing regulations, which the clause empowers us to do after the Bill is enacted. In a number of situations—some of which we have debated this morning on previous amendments—the 26-week qualifying period could be further extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are leaving the position of those on training courses as it is at present, which, according to earlier remarks, is satisfactory, I hope the hon. Lady will agree that it is satisfactory even though my response does not go as far as the amendment proposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that we were getting half a loaf rather than no bread. In fact, we are just seeing the maintenance of the status quo, rather than anything new.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right about the reference to "approved" training. Therefore, amendment No. 80 is less desirable than amendment No. 81.1 am well aware that in the Employment Act 188, the Government took powers to designate training schemes as approved training. That gave the Government powers to require people to take places on schemes and to penalise them if they left schemes early or refused the offer of a place. Our great worry is that employment training is likely to be designated under those powers. Because of the undertakings that we have extracted from the Government, they are going about it in other ways. The Bill is an alternative route to making employment training virtually compulsory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am well aware of the legal meaning of approved training. I agree with the Minister that, as drafted, amendment No. 80 is defective. But we still have amendment No. 81. It makes our point, and it is a simple point. The Minister said that my argument implies that people who are unemployed should get unemployment benefit indefinitely. That is not the case. The clause refers to a much smaller group of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
people, those who paid their stamps in the past, had an entitlement, and want to requalify for their entitlement to unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who go on training courses are often required to be productive and produce goods and services without receiving any of the money that thereby accrues. They have to live on a low income and receive often poor quality training, but they are showing their dedication and determination to do everything they can to re-enter the labour market. Normally, every change that is made is a mean change in which some money is whittled away. In this case could not the Government be generous to people who are trying so hard to get back into the labour market, and count 13 weeks on a training course as a requalification for unemployment benefit? Nothing that the Minister has said has persuaded me that that is not a reasonable request. If my hon. Friends agree, we will vote on amendment No. 81 rather than amendment No. 82.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Lady wishes to do that, she must withdraw amendment No. 80.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should make myself clear. In agreeing with the hon. Lady on one point, I may be in danger of misleading her and the Committee. The effect of the clause, combined with the regulations that we will lay, will be to ensure that although time spent on employment training will not count towards the 13 weeks of requalifying employment, it will not count towards the 26-week period in which a 13-week return to the labour market must be demonstrated. I may have suggested that this returned to the situation that existed before, when that 13 weeks could be made over an indefinite period of time. That is not so. The 26 weeks still apply, and the training period is excluded from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment benefit is not important for people who are on employment training schemes and wish to benefit from them. However, the amendment would introduce a small incentive, after 13 weeks, to drop out of the employment training course. As the hon. Lady recognised, being on or off a course is not part of the judgment of whether someone is actively seeking work, avoiding work, or whatever. If we adopt what the hon. Lady wants, there would be a slight disincentive for some people to stay on employment courses. I do not put that as a large argument, but it is real. The hon. Lady might like to bear it in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause deals with people who are making a serious and consistent return to the labour market through paid employment. Although training is valuable—and we shall recognise that in regulations—it cannot rightly be regarded as the proof of return to the labour market that we consider necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister reconsider his stance on the argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short)? I did not hear all the debate on the clause, but sometimes in Committee that is an advantage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>329</span>
The comments that I heard made a case that the Government have not answered. Given the Government's stance on the importance of training as a bridge into the labour market, they are being less than generous in rejecting our proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one talks to people on training schemes, rather than listening to some of those who like to talk on their behalf, one will note that most of them are anxious to complete their courses and to see the quality of training increase, even to the detriment of the amount which they are paid. The Government are mistaken about people's commitment to ET and similar schemes—despite the poor quality of training on such schemes—when they say that there are hordes of people, or even just a few, who might, if the amendment is accepted, opt out of their training schemes after 13 weeks so that they could again qualify for unemployment benefit. If the Government are trying to enhance the status of trainees and view training as a move towards full employment for the individual and society generally, they should make this concession, because it is an outward, visible sign that training is coming off benefit and moving back into the labour market. When people move back into the labour market, they build up rights to unemployment benefit in case times do not turn out as well as expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will think further about that. We do not want to catch them out and score small victories, but the Government's policies on benefits, training and full employment are in a state of flux. The amendment would send the right sign to people on training courses. The Government's present stance says, "Training is still part of the welfare culture." I thought that the Government wanted to say that training was breaking away from that culture and was a move towards getting back into the labour market. My hon. Friend's amendment makes the Government's case for them, so surely they would want to reflect it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's argument is circular. I made it clear that I believe that those who go on training schemes do so because of the value of such schemes for getting back into work. My point was in reply to the suggestion that the new rule will somehow be a disincentive to take up training. One could argue the opposite; that it would be a disincentive to stay on a training course. I do not believe that. People go on training courses as a way of getting back into the labour market. But training is not in itself the labour market. If we are to draw a line—and we should—returning to the labour market is returning to paid employment. However, we recognise the value of training schemes. We have created no disincentive to those who leave training schemes by extending in regulations the 26 week period in which people must have returned to the labour market for 13 weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Government say that training is not part of the labour market? People on training schemes disappear from the unemployment figures. Sometimes, cynically, I think that the Government have an interest in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
Trainees are most insistent about the work experience that they get from training. They are at work, doing a proper job, and rebuilding contacts with the labour market. I do not mind whether the Minister says that this is a circular argument and wants to misrepresent what has been said, but I make the case again that this is an opportunity for the Government to enhance the status of those who have taken up training as a bridge back into the labour market. The Government should accept that as a way signalling that training is a change away from welfare and back into work. It fits in with their policy of reducing the number of those who register for benefit for unemployment purposes, and will demonstrate to many people that the Government take training as seriously as do the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members are not persuaded by the Minister's case. Its biggest flaw, which exposes it for what it is, is that the Government want to have their cake and eat it, to count people on training schemes as not being in the unemployment statistics, and, for certain purposes, to count them in employment statistics. However, when it comes to their rights to benefit from having been employed, he is not willing to treat them in that way.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 83, in page 5, line 38, after "week", insert
	<br><q><p>"or to the full extent normal in his case".</p></q>
This is an important amendment which reintroduces the opportunity to discuss the concept of the "full extent normal" rule. There is always difficulty in discussing a Bill in which one clause interacts with another, as one tends to go back and forward over the same points. Nevertheless, that is inevitable, and I know that you, Mr. Winterton, understand the difficulties that arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since Second Reading, we have been concerned with how unemployment law will force people into
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>331</span>
a round of activity to try to obtain work of some kind. I do not wish to stray too much on to the territory of clause 9, but one new aspect of the Bill is the way in which the definition of die sort of work that they can be forced into has widened. Our concern about that stands alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, our concern is exacerbated by the existence within the benefit system of rules that were devised, either by statute or case law, in the days of full employment, and which, to a degree, are appropriate to the days of full employment. They are intended to protect the national insurance scheme against misappropriation by someone who is deliberately choosing, for reasons of his own, to work part-time or on a temporary basis, and then claim benefit for the days on which he is not working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a variety of rules. The one to which this amendment relates is the most anomalous and most difficult. It is particularly alarming that the Government should be changing this aspect of the law. They are putting emphasis on people taking any kind of work, no matter what sort of work it is or whether it is work that they would choose to do, but also maintaining the benefit rules that penalise people who make that judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our previous sitting, the Under-Secretary talked about proposed changes to some aspects of the benefit regulations. However, I am not sure whether the cure is not as bad as, or worse than, the disease. To requalify for unemployment benefit at all, a claimant is required to have worked for at least 16 hours a week for 13 weeks. Less than 16 hours is regarded as not bringing a person within the scope of the national insurance scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the scheme at one time depended on the level of contributions that had been paid, and on them having been paid for 13 weeks. When the system of flat-rate contributions was abolished, it had to be replaced by an "hours worked" test, because that simple link no longer worked in quite the same way. However, the effect was intended to be broadly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That constrasts dramatically with the rule to which the amendment refers, as it has come to be applied in practice. Even its name sounds arcane and ludicrous—the "full extent normal" rule. Originally it was intended to deal with genuinely anomalous cases, where someone was working full-time and did not intend, of their own volition, to work any more hours than they already were, although their working hours were concentrated perhaps into three or four days a week. Nevertheless, the law as it previously stood enabled them to claim unemployment benefit for the other days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person whose pattern of work was such that he worked long hours for a short period was not truly unemployed for the other days. The invention of the rule that we are discussing goes back to the umpires—the inter-war predecessors of the social security commissioners—who invented the rules to deal with that anomalous case, which was given statutory force in the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946. Opposition Members argue that its purpose since has been distorted by various commissioners' decisions. The cumulative effect of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>332</span>
those is that, far from what was intended—which was to prevent the payment of benefit to people in full-time work—the rule is now used to prevent payment of benefit to people who are working perhaps a tiny part of one day a week and earning no more than pocket money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even though such people may have worked full-time for many years before they became unemployed, and may still be actively seeking full-time work during those hours when they are not employed, they can still be told that their present job, for two hours a week, is now considered the full extent of their normal work, so they are not entitled to benefit for any other hours or days in the week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is blatantly unjust and utterly ridiculous, and has nothing to do with the original purpose of the rule. My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) quoted the judgment of Lord Templeman who said:
	<br><q><p>"The obscure language of the regulation"—</p></q>
the regulation that relates to the test—
	<br><q><p>"compelled the Commissioners to invest… tests which are not found in the…regulation and are, therefore, hedged around with qualifications."</p></q>
In the recent Brunt case—a test case on the matter—the Commissioner said:
	<br><q><p>"I can see no way in which I can properly circumvent the words of the legislation and thereby obviate a preposterous result. Whether anything will ever be done about it by the legislature, I do not know. In this corner of the law … there appears to be an extraordinary antipathy to remedying injustices which save departmental money."</p></q>
That case went to the Court of Appeal, where Lord Justice Kerr said:
	<br><q><p>"None of the interpretations of the test … which have so far been discussed appear to draw any discernable line of social or other sensible policy distinction between those who are eligible and those who are not. How can that have been in accordance with the intention of the legislation? Presumably the legislation has some underlying policy purpose. But where is it reflected in the various interpretations of…the 1983 regulations which have been published and discussed?</p></q>
Experience teaches us that no discernible line of social or sensible policy distinction is in practice drawn. It appears to me—I speak purely from experience of the cases that have been drawn to my attention—that in a local office, some eager and well-informed person might be seized of the way in which the "full extent normal" rule might operate and decide to apply it to a particular individual. The chances are extremely high—98 or 99 per cent.—that that individual would be caught by it. If there was nobody in that local office who was filled with that zeal—alternatively, the office may have a more sensible and charitable approach—such a person probably would not be drawn to the attention of the authorities or the commissioners and would continue to be able to draw benefit. However, there seems to be little doubt that as case law has developed, almost anyone who undertook any sort of part-time work might be in danger of falling foul of the "full extent normal" rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall two examples from my own postbag. One case was of a woman who was working, I believe, as a barmaid for some two hours a week on a Monday night and earning the princely sum of £4. One can imagine her sentiments when she discovered that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>333</span>
that was now ruled to be the full extent of her normal work. She thought that she was taking it as something to help out a little and, of course, she was not falling foul of benefit regulations which elsewhere allow someone to earn that sort of money without losing benefit. The only reason she lost her entitlement to unemployment benefit or income support was because it was ruled that that was the full extent of her normal work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case that was drawn to my attention is in some ways less obviously ridiculous but is unfair. A young man had been working as a supply teacher for some time, not because he preferred to, but because that was the only work available in his education authority, and at that time, quite widely across the country, and he was not able to take up a post as a full-time teacher in a school. As the rate support grant continued to be withdrawn from local authorities and the net tightened, the local authority by whom he was employed as a supply teacher decided that its bill for people in his circumstances was too high. Therefore, it cut down the number of days that he worked each week—from five to three, if I remember correctly. There was no question but that that was what had happened and that he would infinitely have preferred to have worked and been paid for five days a week as a supply teacher rather than draw unemployment benefit for two days a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The local authority wrote to the commissioners or to the tribunal—I cannot recall precisely what stage the case reached—and said that it would like to employ the teacher for five days a week but could no longer afford to and that he wished to work for five days a week but was no longer allowed to by the authority. Nevertheless, because a pattern of employment had persisted for a given period, it was ruled that that was the full extent of his normal work even though it was plain from the evidence that that was not by his wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Thursday, the Under-Secretary told us that the Government propose to make some changes in the ludicrous rule. He admitted that it
	<br><q><p>"gives rise to anomalies,… in which some people are disallowed benefit as a result of a small amount of earnings whereas others can retain benefit even though their earnings—made almost invariably at a weekend—do not affect their benefit."</p></q>
Unfortunately, instead of making the rule better for all the people who would so ludicrously be caught by its operation, the Government—as is so often the case—are merely making it worse for those who might now get away with something that the Government do not wish to see them get away with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary said that the Government propose
	<br><q><p>"to add a 'de minimis' provision to the rule and to introduce a cut-off point, at which those on"</p></q>
what he called
	<br><q><p>"high earnings from part-time work will lose all benefit in the week concerned."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee F, 2</i> February 1989; c. 312.]</p></q>
He said that the new form of the rule would probably introduce an automatic lower threshold and that no one who earned less than £12 a week would be affected. He said also that there would be a simple
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>334</span>
and straightforward higher threshold, which would be the lower earnings threshold for national insurance liability—£41, rising to £43 in April, over a seven-day period—and that someone earning at that level would no longer be able to draw unemployment benefit for any day in that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That appears to take the matter out of the realm of the full extent of someone's normal work and turn it into a rule that says, "It no longer matters whether you are forced or not forced to work part time; all that we are interested in now are the earnings that you get from the work. We have realised that saying that people are undertaking the full extent of their normal work makes us look absolutely stupid when they may be earning only £2, £3 or £4 a week, so we shall cut out part-time work that pays up to £12." That also ties in with some of the earnings disregards which operate elsewhere in benefits schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a harsh operation of the rule to say that, automatically, everyone who is earning up to £41 a week will be assumed to be in full-time work and that will be assumed to be their normal work. We believe that the new test will mean that unemployment benefit will be subject to a means test, and people will lose entitlement if they earn more than £40 in any one week, irrespective of whether that is their choice, whether that is the full extent of their normal work and whether that is the only employment opportunity into which the operations of clauses 7 or 10 have forced them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, the schoolteacher whom I mentioned was working for only three days a week because that was all that he was allowed to work. He will still be caught by the new rule. I am not sure what someone earns for three days of supply work, but I doubt whether it is less than £41 a week. The rule would be of no benefit to someone in his circumstances. The Government have devised a package that will not only leave most of the injustices unremedied but might save more money than the original rule did, because it will continue to penalise people in situations in which it was never intended to operate and for which it was never devised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment makes the point that that is one way in which the Government will be unfairly penalising people. But people might also be unfairly penalised under clause 8 with regard to their ability even to requalify for unemployment benefit if their circumstances and their work should change, or if they should become unemployed again. Under the amendment, if someone doing two or three hours a week were liable to be treated as if they were working full time and lose their right to benefit for the rest of the week, they should also be treated as working full time for the purpose of requalifying for that benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has argued considerably wider than the amendment. I make no complaint about that, because she would say that she was putting the issue in its full context. I noted the cases that she mentioned, and I shall carefully read the 	<i>Official Report</i> and reflect upon them. She will correct me if I am wrong, but she seemed to begin to argue that there should be no ceiling of earnings to restrict or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0208">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>335</span>
remove the entitlement to unemployment benefit. If she was not saying that, I should be glad to have her acknowledgement, because there would be an argument about what point that should be and how much money a person should be able to earn in paid employment until his entitlement to unemployment benefit is obliterated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of what the hon. Lady said did not connect with the clause. The amendment would allow weeks in which a person works for less than 16 hours to be reckonable for requalification purposes. That would apply in cases where a person had done his full normal week's work which amounted to less than 16 hours. The requirement to have worked 16 hours in a week for that week to reckon for the purposes of requalification was established in 1978. It aligned the test with the level needed to qualify for coverage under employment protection legislation. The Government see no reason to change that alignment and to base requalification on a less substantial employment period. We also see a 16-hour rule without any reference to level of earnings as a minimum indication of a return to the labour market. As I said earlier to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Hynn) that makes it much easier for people in part-time jobs and low-paid jobs to requalify.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not quite clear how the "full extent normal" would be defined under the amendment. In other circumstances, a person is considered to be working to their full normal extent after a period when work patterns have been established. It is difficult to see how a pattern would be established in what may be just 13 weeks, certainly within 26 weeks, when that is after a period of one year's unemployment. The amendment would not assist those disallowed unemployment benefit under the "full extent normal" rule who do not need to requalify for benefit as they have not exhausted their title. However, it would give those who have done that and who have not worked for a year the same requirement as everyone else, which is 16 hours, over 13 weeks in a 26-week period. That is not full-time work as it is normally considered, but part-time work, and it is not regular work, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said when we debated the "full extent normal" rule more widely, the Government accept that it has anomalies, is not working well and is unfair in many cases. We intend to change it. But it would not be right to enable some people, even if they could be identified, to whom the full extent normal rule would still apply—even though they would not have had time to establish that after a long period of unemployment—to requalify in less than 16 hours a week over the 13 weeks. The Government therefore feel unable to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the Minister. He asked me whether I thought that there should be no ceiling of earnings to determine whether a person should be able to receive unemployment benefit for the days when they are not engaged in the work in question. No, I would not go as far as that. But, when the rule was devised, it dealt with a person whose level of earnings from part-time work was so high that it could be considered a reasonable income for the general pattern of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>336</span>
If the Minister suggests that the cut-off point should be average male weekly earnings, to take an example at random, that would be an arguable point and we would want to consider the implications. But the Minister is not saying that. He says that the cut-off point should be at the lowest possible level of earnings that qualify for national insurance contributions. I should like to see members of this Committee trying to live on £40 a week. They would find it extremely difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, a single person might have a great struggle. I suspect that they would not be entitled to housing benefit or to any of the in-work benefits that the Government preach about, such as family credit, because they are payable only to people with children. Yet that is work into which they may be pushed or forced by the operation of the Bill. We do not say that there should be no ceiling, but the Government's suggested ceiling is quite inadequate. The Government should look again at the purpose of the original test to try to devise a way of dealing with the underlying injustice it was to resolve. They are merely tacking on to an existing rule, which is ludicrous in its operation, a financial amendment that they hope will make it slightly less ludicrous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the provision would not make any difference to people who have not exhausted their benefit entitlement, however, even though they have not exhausted it, they will not have the full benefit entitlement. If they have exhausted their entitlement to unemployment benefit they should be subject to the same regulations as everyone else. In any case, they will not have established the pattern that would be required to show that it was the full extent of someone's normal work within the period allowed for in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may have clarified something that was unclear. Last week, he said that the Government propose to add the provision to the existing regulations. Perhaps he will expand on that. A pattern of employment will continue to be in the background legislation. Unless there is a requirement for a pattern of such employment to have been established, the test is simply financial and none the better for that. The Minister said that it is all right for people who have exhausted their entitlement to benefit to have to meet the same conditions as anyone else and to have to satisfy the requirement of the clause to work 16 hours, because that is a minimum indication of their return to the labour market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and the Government appear to be having it both ways. The rule says, "This is the full extent of a person's normal work, and he is not entitled to unemployment benefit for the days on which he is not engaged in that work." If that does not mean that a person has returned to the labour market, what does it mean? By definition, it must mean that, otherwise the Minister is saying, "Well, we know you have not really returned to the labour market, but it is a convenient way of saving some money, and we do not propose to do anything about it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the test of a return to the labour market is a 16-hour minimum, the full extent normal rule should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>337</span>
apply only to hours of work which are below 16 hours. That should apply to whatever tests the Government provide in the legislation. The maximum earnings allowed under the full extent normal rule will be less than £3 an hour for a 16-hour week. It is possible that, of their own volition, someone in part-time work may earn more than £41 a week, yet they may not have returned to the labour market as fully as they would wish. Again, that reflects our main anxiety about the operation of the Bill and the way in which it will be offset by the rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government say that people must actively look for work, no matter what sort of work it is—part-time, temporary, or work that a person would not normally choose to do or in which they do not feel that they are making a contribution to society. Yet, under clause 7, the Government will penalise people forced into part-time work of less than 16 hours a week, because the Government have decided that that is the full extent of their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister suggested that I may have strayed a little widely in trying to explain to the Committee what the rule means and how it operates. I am glad that I did. The point about the case of the schoolteacher is that he did not wilfully choose to work for only 3 days a week—he had no choice. Depending on the assessment of schoolteachers' hours, teachers working part time may be caught by the rule. The Minister has not made his case. He should explain how the Government envisage the rule working. He should consider the matter again. Otherwise, it will be heads the Government win, and tails the claimants lose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reply only briefly to the hon. Lady. I am glad that we agree on the principle of having a ceiling for earnings over which unemployment benefit should be extinguished or reduced. The important argument is the level of that ceiling, but that is not part of the amendment or the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady is mistaken in believing that some "full extent normal" consideration would apply if requalification for unemployment benefit were obtained through working for the time required for everyone to requalify. Therefore, the amendment would not help people to avoid the malign effects of the "full extent normal" rule—I agree with the hon. Lady that it has some malign effects—because it would not apply in that case. The amendment would simply create a category to which the rule would not obviously, necessarily, or rightly apply and in which people would be able to requalify at a lower level of hours worked than everyone else. That is unreasonable and would not have the effect desired by the hon. Lady.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that it is unlikely that a person caught by the "full extent normal" rule also has to work for the 16 hours to requalify. That is not our point or that of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone who works fewer than 16 hours a week will be caught by the "full extent normal" rule when
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>338</span>
working part time, it is unjust that they should also—if they lose that work—not qualify for unemployment benefit when they are completely unemployed, because they have not had the opportunity to requalify, as they have not worked the hours that the Minister says that they must. Our amendment is intended to rectify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without straying into the matter of hours, the Government should be consistent in their approach. It is dangerous to urge consistency on the Government, because they consistently go to the lowest common denominator. Nevertheless, yet again, an anomaly arises with regard to the 'full extent normal" rule under the clause. It is wrong that, under clause 8, requalification for unemployment benefit demands that someone work at least 16 hours a week, when, in other ways, particularly with the "full extent normal" rule, such a qualification is not part of the working of the legislation. That is a fresh anomaly, and the Minister should consider it again. Perhaps he should ask the Social Security Advisory Committee to consider it when it considers the redrafting of the regulations. If fresh inspiration has come to the Minister, perhaps he should enlighten us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not fresh inspiration, but support for my earlier comments that the "full extent normal" rule is built up over a period. A pattern of work must be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing individuals who have exhausted their year's benefit entitlement and are requalifying. After a year's unemployment, no pattern of work is established and it would be months before that pattern is established, certainly the six months or 26 weeks required under clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady said many interesting things about the "full extent normal" rule, and I agree with some of them. But she is trying to solve a problem that does not exist for a requalifying claimant who may have been hit by that rule at an earlier stage. The hon. Lady would create a privilege for a group who cannot be defined because of the need to establish patterns of work over time. It is a complicated point. The hon. Lady and I disagree on many matters, including the effect of her amendment and its usefulness to any group who may have been previously "disbenefited" by the rule. We are talking at cross purposes of the hon. Lady thinks that the amendment will help those people. It will not help in the narrow case of requalification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If someone has been unemployed for over a year, and takes part-time work for fewer than 16 hours a week, because that is all that they can get or because the Department makes them take it, they may work in that post for two or three years, because it is still all that they can get. During that period, some zealous individual in the Department may apply the "full extent normal" rule to the person. If the person continues in that part-time work—because he has no choice—and then loses it, clause 8 would disqualify him from being entitled to claim unemployment benefit when he becomes unemployed.

The Minister may be correct, and perhaps I misunderstand the operation of the clause or the amendment, but he is assuming that everyone caught by clause 8 would have had their year of unemployment benefit, but, shortly thereafter, would have had part-time work and then would, or would not, have requalified for unemployment benefit. Those are the circumstances with which clause 8 will deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing unreal or unlikely in the scenario that I have outlined. Someone could be in part-time work of less than 16 hours a week and be unable to requalify. The Minister has said that it is not possible, but it is quite possible that there will be interaction between the "full extent normal" rule and clause 8.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provision does not apply to the 13-week requalification period. If, as the hon. Lady says, the claimant has been in part-time employment for much longer—say three or four years—I accept that the situation may be different. I say "may be different" because I have been addressing a situation which would be created by the 13 weeks of re-entitlement. The clause cannot have the effect that the hon. Lady fears, because patterns will not have been sufficiently established. The situation may be different over three or four years, but we are talking about the "full extent normal" rule, rather than the narrow intention of this clause, which is to establish the period for requalification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister appears to be saying that he has defined a case in which the amendment does not apply, so we should not put forward any other cases. I sympathise with his predicament—I often feel the same myself—but that is not why we are here. In the case that the Minister describes, he has convinced me that the "full extent normal" rule would not interact with clause 8.1 remain of the view that, in the case that I described, there would be just such an interaction. That is why we have moved the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that this is a complicated matter. Someone could, in an unjust and anomalous way, be affected by both clause 8 and the "full extent normal" rule. Nothing that the Minister has said so far convinces me that that will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the Minister will not take the olive branch that I have held out to him three or four times and say, "This is a complicated matter. Perhaps we should take it away and study it, or ask the Social Security Advisory Committee to look at it when considering the "full extent normal" rule. If the Department of Social Security intends people to be caught by the "full extent normal" rule and still not be allowed to requalify for unemployment benefit, that is fine. I doubt whether anyone has thought about the issue to that extent. Nevertheless, there are people—human beings—who could be affected. It would not do the Minister any harm to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>340</span>

(Mrs. Beckett) were misplaced. Perhaps he will also say that about this amendment. If so, I should be grateful to hear that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 8, a person will, in normal circumstances, have had to work for 13 of the previous 26 weeks to requalify for benefit. There will be exceptions; subsection (2B) of the clause, which will be added to section 18 of the Social Security Act 1975, gives the Secretary of State power to prescribe cases in which the 13 weeks work can be spread over a longer period. Amendment No. 64 would add "presecribed occupations" to the existing provision for prescribed cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the Minister has in mind those exceptions that will be allowed. That is why the power is being provided. It would assist us if we could have further examples of the exceptions. Last night on the Floor of the House, there were two private Bills dealing with penalty fares on British Rail and on London Regional Transport, which covered the underground and buses. In each case, the hon. Member supporting the Bill read out a list of excuses that would be acceptable to authorised personnel by someone who was travelling on British Rail or London Regional Transport without a ticket. I do not intend to go through all the examples—some were, I have lost my ticket, the cat ran off with it, the local Member of Parliament snatched it out of my hands when I took it from the ticket machine—but at least we were given a whole set of examples. It was not an exhaustive list. The mind boggles at the sort of excuses that the fertile imagination could conjure up when faced with the authorised personnel demanding to know why someone was travelling without a ticket.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would be greatly obliged if the Minister would tell us the sort of examples he has in mind with prescribed cases, and whether he will accept the amendment to add a prescribed occupation. Amendment No. 64 was prompted by Equity, because of the peculiar position of actors and actresses. I have already explained why members of the acting profession should be treated differently. Theirs is not the only profession that could be included as a prescribed occupation. The union feels that its members need longer than a period of 26 weeks in order to obtain 13 weeks' work. If the amendment is not accepted, many problems will arise for Equity members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Minister some background information about short working contracts. Professional performers' contracts are often short and may be for only one or two days. It is a difficult, hazardous profession, with a great deal of uncertainty attached to it. There are times when one wonders why anyone would want to follow such a profession. Then one realises that many people are ready to follow hazardous professions, including our own. When Members of Parliament complain, as they do from time to time, about what a hard lot they have to endure, I always point out that there is a long line of people waiting to take over our jobs—there certainly is in my local party. It is better than working on the checkout at Tesco. Therefore, I can understand
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>342</span>
why actors and actresses wish to go in for such a hazardous occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, even substantially remunerative and prestigious contracts in the mechanical media—film, television and radio—seldom exceed two weeks. I do not know the length of the contract that the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) has been able to negotiate with Mr. Murdoch and Sky Television, or whether he has preferential contract terms to my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsy (Mr. Mitchell) who has already paid a certain price for his new job. I do not know whether Sky Television has an audience in three figures yet, but it seems to be of the size that is read over to the studio staff so that they know how many people are out there viewing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rare even in the prestigious parts of the profession to have long contracts. Only two major theatre companies—the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre Company—have year-long, or longer, contracts. Most theatres employ a person only for a specific production, and not between productions. Contracts in fill-in work, such as videos, training films, extra work and voice-over work, are usually of only one day's duration. Most members rely on these as bread-and-butter work between the more substantial contracts, if they are able to obtain them. However, they are not sufficient for requalification purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Short contracts are separated by periods of unemployment during which members of Equity is wholly occupied in seeking work. I refer to various points I made about amendments on clause 7. Many agents could be seeking work on behalf of actors or actresses, who could themselves be trailing around the audition circuit. I suppose that it is rather like selection committees—I keep comparing them to ourselves, so that we can understand their position better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all Committee members could quote the horrible humiliations that have been heaped upon us as we traipse round the country trying to get selected. It did not happen to me, as I was quickly snapped up. However, I am sure that Conservative Members had many forlorn journeys into wastelands to offer their political skills to an unwilling selection committees. However, we all end up here eventually, even though some of us are perhaps here for only a short time before we are back out seeking work again. However, actors and actresses have a miserable job at times, having to sell themselves, being told, "Don't phone us, we'll phone you." I am sure that we have all had that sort of reaction from a selection committee in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For several weeks, Equity members may obtain only one or even no days' work if there is no fill-in work available. It could be some time before a suitable contract is obtained. The availability of work and contracts are beyond the control of professional performers, and are largely determined by fluctuations in arts funding, in private sponsorship of productions, and parts available. This is a serious point. It is not just a case of getting any work, which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>343</span>
we have heard mentioned in Committee from time to time. Unlike other occupations, an actor may only go for parts consistent with their physical appearance or voice. I can see many Conservative Members who would automatically qualify for a Dracula, a Frankenstein's monster or Quasimodo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkhope</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not trying to become one of those. I should like to point out to the hon. Member that my application to Mr. Plouviez to join Equity, when I first heard of the threat of television in this place, was turned down on the basis that I had no qualities or qualifications good enough to join Equity in the first place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Far be it from me to be open and throw a bribe across the Committee, but I am sure that I could to business with the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Neither have I. The matter has gone slightly wide of the amendment, and I do not wish to be ruled out of order. One of Equity's problems is that there are so many people within the acting profession that up to 80 per cent, of its members at any one time are out of work. The idea of the numbers being swelled by 650 members of Parliament will probably not go down too well with existing Equity members looking for work. It is a serious point that the hon. Member may wish to contemplate. I nearly said that we are all here in gainful occupation, but I decided that that was too dangerous and controversial a term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We certainly have a job, for which we receive a pay cheque at the end of the month, which is more than many of our citizens are able to do. However, many of us also have more than one job. I am thinking of the right hon. Member for Chingford, who is no doubt doing a good Equity or National Union of Journalists member out of a job, as indeed is my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby. I hope that when they receive those enormous pots of gold from Mr. Murdoch they think carefully of those who could do with one job, let alone the 60 or so that some of them here have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between actors and Members of Parliament when we go through the trauma of selection.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>344</span>
to work hard on behalf of our constituents and I am sure that Conservative Members are doing that too. I should not like to cast any aspersions on them. However, there are times when it is not recognised that some hon. Members have far more problems than others. I know of many Conservative Members whose only problem seems to be which garden fete to open on a Saturday. My problems in the east end of London come by the dump truck load. Those points go wide of the amendment, but we should bear in mind that there are people who are not as fortunate as us and who will not be able to qualify under the terms of the Bill unless the Minister accepts the amendment and enters prescribed occupations so that actors and actresses can take advantage, rather than fall foul, of the Bill's provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying earlier that some actors and actresses can go only for parts that are consistent with their physical appearance. Even the most established actors can suffer weeks of unemployment before obtaining a further contract. It is difficult for members of Equity to get a string of contracts, adding up to 13 weeks of 16 hours a week within a 26 week period, when many contracts are so short and separated by the periods of unemployment such as I have described. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to amendment No. 84. The notes on clauses say the following about the use of the power that the Minister will have under the addition of new subsection (2B) to section 18 of the 1975 Act.
	<br><q><p>"It is intended, for example, that the period would be extended where the person was in receipt of sickness benefit or statutory sick pay in the relevant period."</p></q>
In other words, if someone had failed to clock up the required 13 weeks' work within the normal 26-weeks limit because he had been ill, the limit would be extended. Will the Minister confirm that any period of sickness will be ignored for that purpose? Will a person who was sick for 10 weeks have 36 weeks rather than 26 weeks in which to requalify for benefit by 13 weeks' work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only the claimant's sickness that may interrupt the requalification period. There are many other possible reasons why a person might need more than 26 weeks to clock up those 13 weeks of work. He might have booked a holiday for the family. Would he be expected to cancel or postpone it so that he could get 13 weeks' work before the 26 weeks had expired? We are again asking the Minister to flesh out the bones of the Bill, if not with an exhaustive list, at least with sufficient examples to make us feel that not too many people will be caught out by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if the last crucial week that would bring a person's score up to 13 is a compulsory holiday which cannot be cancelled or postponed? Will the regulations enable the period to be extended in such cases? What discretions will be permissible?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 84 would require that the regulations must cover one important reason why the 26 week period would need to be extended— where the claimant has missed the target because he or she has had to spend part of the 26 weeks looking after another member of the family who may be ill
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>345</span>
or whose normal career may be temporarily unavailable. Will such cases be covered by the regulations? If so, will regulations be broadly drafted so that normal periods of short-term sickness or respite care are covered, or will there be the usual restrictive conditions such as that the person being cared for must be in receipt of attendance allowance? Those are genuine cases and problems. I hope that if the Minister cannot accept the amendment he will assure us that our fears are, as he told my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South, misplaced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all enjoyed the performance of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) and I shall give him some satisfaction on a few of his points, but I shall not be able to meet him on all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are designed to ease the requalification test for some groups, including carers, those looking after the elderly, disabled or sick, and occupations to be "prescribed". The hon. Gentleman mentioned Equity at length, but I did not catch any other professions that he had in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are sessional teachers. I have no immediate examples, but as the amendment has a restricted application, it should be much easier for the Minister to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman spoke entertainingly on behalf of Equity and its case, as he did last week, when I said that I would consider including a provision in the regulations that the use of agencies or managers would be properly recognised as part of, if not the whole, process of actively seeking work. I cannot go so far today to change the rules on requalification for unemployment benefit. I cannot say either that it can be extended beyond the 26 weeks for a limited period, or extended at all. Although I accept the hon. Gentleman's comments about the way that jobs start and finish in the acting profession, and the times of resting in between, it may not be possible to make a diffferent rule for that profession which would help it, and be fair to other professions in which there are interruptions to work. The acting profession accepts that there are periods of unemployment and many actors take jobs while they are not acting. Those jobs are the sort that people might be expected to take within the 26 weeks to make up the 13 weeks of part-time work to requalify.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would individual discretion be permitted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On clause 7, I tried to explain how an actor or actress seeks work. If, during the period of unemployment, it is shown that that person sought work, would that satisfy the authorities or the Minister? It will be difficult if actors or actress must take jobs, because an agent may phone and say, "Can you come round to the studios tomorrow, we've got a voice-over for you?" When they are washing dishes or working the checkout at Tesco.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked if I knew of any other occupations because he said that it would be unfair
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>346</span>
to other occupations if he made actors and actresses a prescribed occupation. Perhaps the Minister has examples of when it would be unfair? I cannot think of any.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The acting profession is a good example of one in which work can be, and is frequently, intermittent. The hon. Gentleman's comments do not clarify what he wants the regulations to achieve. Does he want there to be no requalifying time for actors and actresses, or an unlimited period? Equity has a special position in the acting profession and I do not want to make hard and fast judgments in the middle of the debate. I should like to reflect on what the hon. Gentleman has said, but I am not clear about what he is pressing for. If he would clarify that, I should find it useful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has a valid point. The period could not be open ended. If the Minister is saying to me that if I were to re-think, take advice, come up with a formula and try again he would seriously consider it, I am certainly prepared to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be interested to hear further from the hon. Gentleman outside the Committee, but my reaction now is that I would be misleading him if I were to say that I readily saw a way to put the acting profession into a different position from any other occupation. Part-time jobs outside acting are open to members of the acting profession when they are not working just as they are open to anyone else—and, of course, many actors and actresses take such jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A figure has miraculously occurred to me, by a process of I know not what, of 52 weeks as a period that the Minister might consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I recognise that as being a year and the full extent to which the 26 weeks can be extended for all the other purposes that might be defined and set down in the regulations. The power under subsection (2B) would allow us to do that for up to a year; it is a question of whether it is right or fair to do so. I am not convinced, from what the hon. Gentleman said, that it would be right to do that for the acting profession, although I can see that, as he says, it is a special case because of the shortness of the contracts for many of its members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he did not stand exactly by the words of amendment No. 64, but as drafted, it might circumscribe the power in the clause to make regulations, My interpretation of it is that it would restrict the categories of people—such as the sick or those in training, whom we mentioned earlier—to those in a particular occupation. I know that that was not his intention, but I believe that it would have that effect. The amendment to include prescribed occupations is not necessary to make it possible to use the regulations to extend the period for any occupation for which it seems right to extend it. In that sense, the hon. Gentleman's amendment would not achieve the end that he wants—and if it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>347</span>
did, the end that he wants is redundant because the power is there already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 84 extends the 26-week period for people who have been caring for an elderly or disabled person. I am sympathetic to that and I should like to do it, but if we are to do it in regulations, it must be in a way that can be administratively workable. Therefore, as the hon. Gentleman suspected, it is possible to put it into regulations only where people are not working, or not in employment because they are in receipt of invalid care allowance for looking after somebody at home. The time that such people are in receipt of invalid care allowance would be added to the 26 qualifying weeks, so that goes some way towards what the hon. Gentleman requires. I can go that far because I can see that that could be administratively managed. However, we have not yet drawn up the regulations. It has been useful to have the debate and to hear what the hon. Gentleman has said—no doubt many of his hon. Friends could join in—so that, as far as possible, we can reflect upon, and get right, the regulations to extend extra time to the groups that we believe should receive it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked for a list. The groups that we had in mind are sick people, the people on the training courses that we discussed earlier, those on maternity leave and, as I have just said, the carers who receive the invalid care allowance. Others may be added; we have not yet drafted the regulations. The period will be extended for those who, through no fault of their own, or for an extremely good reason, are not available for work for a period during the 26 weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the second time this morning, we are being promised that the regulations will clarify the position. I hope that we shall see the draft regulations before Report. When I sat on the Committee examining the Housing Bill last year, we waited for a report on the tenants' charter, but it did not emerge before Report. It will be difficult if, after the Bill is enacted, we are expected to accept regulations that will make substantive changes to it and are to have on the Floor of the House the opportunity only to accept or reject them en bloc, without being able to debate them in the detail suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks). I should like the Minister's assurance on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that I cannot give the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) that assurance. I can do no more than refer to what my hon. Friend the Minister for Social Security said when this question arose in a previous sitting. I understand the hon. Gentleman's frustrations. The regulations will extend and ameliorate the overall effect of the clause so to that extent, they should be welcome to the hon. Gentleman. I understand why he wants to see, debate and amend them, but that is not the way that the present system works. It certainly was not the way that the system worked when the hon. Gentleman's party was in power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a long time ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a long time ago. Nevertheless, the problem remains. The body of the primary legislation must provide the opportunity to make regulations. It is possible to suggest pretty clearly, as I have done this morning, some, or possibly all, of the matters that will be included. The system has one value for the hon. Gentleman for Leeds, West and his hon. Friends in that at least the regulations are not drawn up until the Opposition's comments, hopes and fears have been well and truly expressed. To that extent, Opposition Members have an influence on what finally emerges, and for that reason, the debate has been valuable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as possible. First, I have no connection with the British Actors Equity Association. The only parts that I am likely to be offered are Mickey Mouse or Billy Connolly in miniature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a debate about careers. At least there is some hope that people who receive a care grant will be taken into account. Along with my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), I am concerned about the groups of people who are involved. We mentioned sessional teachers. Other sessional workers in educational establishments, such as bar staff, who are often laid off for a long time, especially in the summer months, may also be caught in this time trap. Some of them may be casual workers, but many are not, especially in areas of high unemployment. Such establishments require experienced staff. Although the bar staff may not work over the summer, their P45s are lodged with their employer, otherwise they have to re-apply for their jobs when the colleges, universities or student unions open for the next academic year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will also take into account those sessional workers, who find it difficult to get work during the summer. In a sense, they are still employed, although they are not being paid. The worry is that they will fall into this trap unless certain conditions are accepted. During term time, it is easy for them to prove that they are still working for the polytechnic or university, and that they are not skiving, but they can be caught in a trap because of the nature of their job and the demands placed upon them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, points made by the Opposition will be considered carefully before the regulations are drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to stress that we are discussing requalification after a full year of unemployment benefit has been drawn and we are discussing any 26 weeks, not a period that must start immediately afterwards. If there was a problem with the summer vacation, for example, the period of employment could start later. Requalification requires 13 weeks of work at 16 hours a week, within 26 weeks. That is not an enormously demanding test of a serious return to the labour market. It is more demanding than the present test, but if there is a consistent return to the labour market, the test will not be too difficult to establish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I get the impression that, when the Minister refers repeatedly to the return to the labour

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>349</span>
market, his impression of the labour market is that it is relatively stable, static and offers permanent, secure and reasonably well-paid work. In reality, work is increasingly low-paid, temporary and part time. Our example highlights that. If the labour market is drifting to a fracture between relatively stable and secure work, and relatively insecure and temporary work, social security provisions should take account of that, rather than increasing restrictions and building on a notion that the labour market is permanent and static. Have the Government taken that on board?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes—the provisions refer to part-time work. To requalify, one need only work not every week during the six months but in every other week during the six months. Rules must be made somehow. We have had rules that extended the requalification period. We are limiting the period and the requirement will be much tighter and more demanding. That is right, but we have not ignored, either in the hours required, or by the fact that it is only 13 weeks out of the 26 weeks, that in coming back into the labour market, many people are able to obtain only part-time, and not always regular, work. That is acknowledged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
