<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments are particularly important. Throughout our proceedings, we have been discussing and will discuss, how the Bill affects particular groups, and the Opposition are most interested in how it affects vulnerable people. The Government's propaganda is pretty good and is given an amazingly uncritical reception in the press. Therefore, the Government are good at finding reasons, explanations and excuses for many of their actions. When with each succcessive Social Security Bill, they make a net saving on expenditure, it always turns out to be at the expense of those who are most vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments concern 16 and 17-year-olds. The propaganda theme of this Bill, particularly in clauses 7,9 and 10, is that the unemployed are to blame for their lack of work, and that if they would only bestir themselves, there would be no difficulty. Last year's Social Security Act could be seen as a dry run for this year's Bill. Its message was that the young unemployed were responsible for their circumstances and that large numbers of them were wilfully opting for unemployment. During the general election compaign, and in
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
the rush of excitement that afflicts Conservative Secretaries of State at party conferences, it was proposed that benefit would be withdrawn from those young people who were wilfully refusing either to seek work or to take up one of the many different kinds of training places that the Government were offering, which were all described in extravagantly flattering terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that is not what happened. The proposal was that benefit would be withdrawn from young people who were choosing to lie idle in bed in the morning, even on beautiful mornings like this, instead of looking for training places and for work. That is not what the Government did. Instead, having withdrawn basic and underlying right to benefit from every 16 and 17-year-old, they made some minor concessions to some 16 and 17-year-olds. The rate of benefit that such young people received stemmed not from the Social Security Act 1988 but from the way that income support was structured under the Social Security Act 1986. It introduced for the first time a sort of junior rate of benefit which related not to circumstances but to age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The small number of 16 and 17-year olds who are still entitled to benefit include single parents and people suffering from a handicap or disability. The Government's assumption was that the majority of young people would obtain a place on a youth training scheme. They assumed also—it is the basis of their approach—that the vast majority of young people not only do but should live with their parents, that they are welcome and properly cared for in their parental homes and that there is sufficient income to look after them. We would all wish that happy picture to be the case for all 16 and 17-year-olds, but unfortunately, it is not the reality for some, and they are the most vulnerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some young people who cannot live with their parents can receive income support, but only for a short time after leaving school—for up to a maximum of 16 weeks and then only so that it will give them a breathing space to secure a YTS place. Once that limited entitlement has expired, the only recourse for someone who has not obtained a placement and is left without money is to apply to the Secretary of State to use his discretion to say that they should receive income because otherwise they will face severe hardship. Because the payment is discretionary, there is no right of appeal against a refusal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems that have arisen as a result of that aspect of the legislation are not new in the sense that they were unforeseen. They were precisely foreseen in the Committee stage debates on last year's Act. I have not been surprised, but I have been incensed, by the way in which the Government and some of those who voted for their legislation last year have pretended that the resulting difficulties are a surprise or a mistake. Some well-meaning and worthy bodies—chartiable organisations such as Barnado's, children's homes and so on—have been forced to draw attention to what has happened in practice as a result of the Government's legislation because of the great harm that they see. They have done so more in sorrow than in anger, which implies that somehow it is an unforeseen side effect of the Government's proposals. We must put it clearly on the record—I feel confident that it will be place on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0366">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
record more than once—that there is nothing unforeseen about what is happening to vulnerable 16 and 17-year-olds. It is precisely what we predicted. We warned the Government of it and they chose to ignore it because of the substantial savings that they were able to make by ignoring it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We asked what would happen if insufficient training places were available or if, although training places might be available, some of the young people registered for YTS were not successful in obtaining such places. My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax (Mrs Mahon) moved an amendment which related to the fact that many of the most vulnerable young people—those most in need of support, an assured income and some security—are exactly the young people least likely to be attracted to the managing agents or employers involved in YTS projects. That was ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We sought to write into the legislation that suitable training places, not just any places, should be available. We pressed the Government on whether there would be enough YTS places where young people are living—bearing in mind that the thrust of the legislation is that young people are expected to live at home. All we got from the Government was an assurance. That assurance was couched in sensible terms by the Minister of State, who merely told us that the Department of Employment had insisted that the places would be available, therefore they would be. He was careful—wisely—not to take any personal responsibility. The then Under-Secretary who—perhaps partly for that reason—is no longer with us, was more unwise and gave his own unconditional guarantee that such training places would be available throughout the country. That guarantee has proved to be utterly worthless. Some young people have great difficulty because training places are not available and their benefit entitlement is running out, because they are not accepted for the available training places, or because they leave them after a short time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the Government recognise that young people with no living parents or guardians might be entitled to the short period of income support as of right. That shows the Government's realism; they pass legislation which assumes that young people live with parents, but even they are forced to recognise how unrealistic that is if parents are no longer alive. Young people who do not live with their parents or guardians and who have been in care or custody immediately prior to their 16th birthday, those who are living in accommodation as part of a rehabilitation or resettlement programme under the supervision of a local authority social services department, those who are living away from their parents to avoid physical or sexual abuse and those who are living alone due to their parents' unavailability—whether the parent is ill, in custody or unable to enter the United Kingdom—cannot get benefit after the extension period expires unless they are considered to be experiencing severe hardship. Merely falling into one of these categories is not hardship enough. There must be further proof that some further difficulties may arise at the end of the extension period, if they do not have a place on YTS. If severe hardship is accepted, they can continue to receive benefit for limited
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
periods, although it is discretionary, without the right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I recall last year that we urged the Government to accept that if an award of severe hardship is made, it should be made with some secuity, and should not be withdrawn at a moment's notice. I seem to recall the former Parliamentary Secretary telling us that the provision was necessary because a young person who made a good case for receiving benefit on the grounds of severe hardship could return to his or her parental home. The Opposition expressed grave doubts about that and pointed out that even if that happened, the benefit could be questioned because circumstances had changed. Making the benefit available on only a discretionary basis and for a relatively short time was likely to perpetuate the uncertainty experienced by many young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reports from all over Britain and from a wide variety of statutory and non-statutory agencies, such as social services departments, Barnardos, the Church of England Children's Society, the National Children's Bureau, highlight major problems caused by the legislation. The charitable organisations that offer hostel accommodation to the young homeless and young people leaving care also have major problems because they see increasing numbers of young people who cannot get onto YTS or cannot continue it. Those circumstances apply to young people who have been in care, and to those who may not have been in care immediately prior to their 16th birthday, but who nevertheless have many problems maintaining a relationship in their parental home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
About 8,000 young people a year leave care and the majority have either no home, or no suitable parental home, to which to return. About 70 per cent of those who leave care go to live on their own, compared to about 0.2 per cent of the general population. The reasons for that are clear. It is also clear that, although young people live on their own because that is the best and most realistic option, nevertheless, they may be unprepared, lonely and vulnerable, particularly if they have lived in care for years. They often have to find their own accommodation. We hope that they will at least start off in some of the hostels that offer emotional support, care and assistance. Of course, there are too few such places, and many young people end up in board and lodgings, bedsits and temporary squats, or they sleep on floors in friends' houses. Successive surveys have shown that young people who have left care are over-represented among the numbers of homeless people. In 1988, a Centrepoint study estimated the figure at 25 per cent and some years earlier a Department of the Environment study estimated it at 33 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Although everyone knows that young people are more likely to be destabilised, emotionally disturbed or insufficiently mature to cope with living independently, that is not heeded in the Bill. The Bill requires that they cope with the problems of finding a home, establishing themselves and adjusting to a different way of life, and with the progression from care to full-time employment or to YTS. That is why those young people are often less attractive to those who run
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0367">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
YTS projects. It has now become clear that many young people are failing to get YTS places and are being left without resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several local authorities have noted that they must keep young people in care for longer than they should. They must re-admit young people into care—sometimes into inappropriate placements—not because that is the best way to prepare them for the future, but simply because of the benefit changes. One local authority social services department commented that the benefit changes greatly increase the pressure on vulnerable young people to make major decisions about their lives very quickly. There is a likelihood of increased crime to maintain income, and a feeling that they have nothing much to lose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A charity that provides hospital accommodation points out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As a small voluntary agency we cannot afford to meet the charges and allowances for hostel residents. Nor do we wish to be in the position of having to evict someone because they cannot meet the charges. We are very concerned about these very vulnerable young people. Some will have nowhere to live at a time when they are facing severe emotional stress."</p></blockquote>
Those problems are not confined to young people who have been in care. A local authority in the north of England has reported increased contact with young people aged 16 and over, who have never been in care but who, following the benefit changes, now seek assistance, saying that they cannot return to the family home as they were subjected to abuse there. Under the previous benefit system, that would not necessarily have come to light because young people could establish themselves independently. That option is no longer open to them unless they bring into the open the difficulties that they have been facing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another charity project notes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government knows through its own research on child abuse, alcoholism, crime, drug addiction etc. that some families are unfit places for young people to be and that consequently staying at home is not an option for some. Now it must be made to see that present arrangements are grossly unfair and damaging to some of society's most vulnerable and worst treated people. This project saw 138 16/17 year olds in the final quarter of 1988. None of them had trivial reasons for leaving home and most faced with the facts chose acute poverty rather than staying with their families."</p></blockquote>
Although we regret the new provision, amendment No. 73 does not seek to overturn the provision that young people must be pushed on to YTS. It seeks to offer to the group of people who fall within the five separate definitions—to whom the Government initially gave a small entitlement to income support—a right to full entitlement benefit for as long as they need it, even if they fail to obtain a YTS place. We do not suggest that they should not be required to register for YTS. That is a simple, basic proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to examine how the decisions are made. They should not be discretionary and young people should not have to go through the process that I am about to outline, or to face the kind of decisions that are being made. None of this is theoretical any more. Unfortunately it is all too concrete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We received a report of a particular research project carried out by an organisation in Scotland, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), about young people living in an emerg
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
ency hostel for the homeless. That recent research project was terminated in January this year, and it concerns the operation of the legislation. It describes how decisions are being made as to to whether discretion should be exercised to allow young people to continue to receive income support:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Interviews often took place in open cubicles which have no sound proofing and therefore afford no privacy."</p></blockquote>
These are interviews for young people who have no parents, or who have problems in their parental home. They are seeking to prove to the satisfaction of DSS officers that their problems continue and they should continue to receive benefit on a discretionary basis. The report continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Further, the interviewer sits behind a glass partition which can hardly help to set the young person at ease".</p></blockquote>
Staff felt that they were forced to accompany the young people to all the interviews because they would not leave them to cope on their own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"Staff felt that the interviewers were often very inexperienced and were not aware of the procedures or the questions to be asked. Some seemed to be quite defensive … Others were extremely sympathatic".</p></blockquote>
Decisions have to be made about whether a young person is awarded income support on the grounds of severe hardship. We were assured last year by the Government that these decisions—which cannot be made at local offices—would be made within 24 hours of referral to headquarters in London. I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) remembers that assurance. As the decisions are made at the Secretary of State's discretion, they have to be referred to London.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first young people to be interviewed in this project did not receive a decision until seven days after their interviews. During that period both they and the hostel were anxious as to whether they would receive benefit to allow them to meet their bills and sustain their period of stay in the hostel. When they received their decision, they were given income support for an initial period of four weeks, which presumably means that after that period they had to go through the whole process again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend going to mention the difficulties that Members of Parliament experience in getting this part of the Act brought into force? She quotes the example of young people waiting seven days. The service is not much quicker if Members of Parliament intervene on their behalf and ring the Minister's private office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston intervened in some of those cases. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead says, he was successful in getting a decision, but not within 24 hours. Therefore, there are certainly delays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Open Door project leader who accompanied young people to their interviews said that delays were taking place. As decisons are made at the Secretary of State's discretion, further inquiries have to be made in each case into the circumstances of each young person. There has to be an inquiry into what the circumstances
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0368">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
really are, and whether an award of income support can be justified. The project leader comments:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Certainly, it wasn't satisfactory either to say you'd been sexually or physically abused and that was the reason you were not living at home. You had to say, by whom, for how long, how seriously, and if you had been in care, you had to say why you now couldn't live at home."</p></blockquote>
In other words, even if a young person had been in care because he or she had been abused by his or her parents, that was not considered sufficient reason for not returning home now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The project leader continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One of the young men who had been in care a long time was asked for how long and … he said since he'd been nine and he's now 17. Even that in itself wasn't satisfactory. He was asked why he was in care, and what the family situation was, what his mother's address was, who lived in the house and if his mother had a bigger house could he go back home now. Even though he has never actually lived at home since he was nine … One young woman who explained that she fell into the category of having been sexually abused became extremely distressed and tears were running down her cheeks and she was silently crying throughout most of the interview."</p></blockquote>
The project leader is clearly anxious not to convey the impression that he blames the interviewer for those circumstances. He is right; the Government pass legislation and the unfortunate people who work for the DSS must try to implement it. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I'm not sure that the officer could have handled them"</p></blockquote>
the questions
	<br><blockquote><p>"any better since his role was to enquire and make a case for whether or not they should get I.S. Certainly, as someone who is involved in counselling work I wouldn't have been involved in pursuing such a line of enquiry with a girl who was distressed in such a way but then I wouldn't be in a position where I was trying to determine information for such a reason."</p></blockquote>
There are further examples of query by the untrained. During last year's Social Security Bill proceedings, the Under-Secretary of State said that the discretionary award would be for a comparatively short period, to be reviewed and not given as a right, because the claimant might be able to return home. It seems that, in some circumstances, pressure is put on and inquiries are made to see whether a person can return home because of the benefit implications, not because that is best for the young person's welfare. DSS officers contacted some parents to investigate young people's claims that they could not return home. It is not known why some parents were contacted and others not. The report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is a worrying feature of the new system as it effectively means that a decision can be made on the basis of one phone call or one visit to the parent by an officer who is untrained to make such a complex family assessment. If the parent says that the young person can return home, Income Support can be withheld."</p></blockquote>
An abusing parent may say that the child can return home.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Two young people were turned down in their claims for Income Support on this basis. One young person had been in Open Door three times as she was regularly thrown out of her parents' house. Staff had had regular contact with her family and were satisfied that she had genuine and pressing reasons for living apart from them. However, even with a supporting letter from staff, she was turned down."</p></blockquote>
Again, we are not talking about unsupported
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
assertions or young people who say, "I don't want to live at home with mummy and daddy any more", but about people who have been in continuous contact with professionals who are trained to make such a judgment. The staff of such a small hostel cannot take just anyone who comes along, but must make difficult judgments about who really needs their help and support. In this case, they conveyed their judgment to officers of the DSS and it was rejected, even though my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston took up the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The young woman in question was refused income support. She left the hostel but she did not return home, even though she had no income. I do not know whether she squatted or stayed with friends, but although she was denied income—presumably because her parents said that she could go home—she did not go home.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Three weeks later, she referred herself again to the hostel."</p></blockquote>
She has now been four or five times to the hostel and her claim to income support on the grounds of severe hardship has once again been turned down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is how decisions are made. I shall give a few more examples of the kind of decisions that are being made. We have examples from all over the country and
I am picking out only a few. The first concerns a young man from the area represented by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr Battle).

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add one detail to my hon. Friend's remarks. It may come as a shock to the Minister in view of the figures that we are repeatedly given that the unemployment figures for Leeds, which were released last week, show that unemployment there has increased. Therefore, the situation is more difficult—not less difficult, as the Minister suggests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That background information is most helpful, and suggests one reason why the young man might be having such problems. He succeeded in obtaining one job for a week and was praised by his supervisor. During that week, his background came to light and at the end of the week, he was sacked with no explanation. By the Government's standards, he is in someways one of the successes. He is living with his parents and receives no form of income support, although he is looking for work and a YTS place.

Another example is from Richmond—Richmond in London; this is not a by-election point. It concerns a young man who is staying in a bail hostel, so he has presumably already been involved in some offence. There is no point in his joining a YTS course and no

one would take him because he will be in the area for a short time only. His bridging allowance has run out leaving him with no income. The social security office has refused to deal with the case, saying that he does not come within any of the exceptional categories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last year, we asked the Government what would happen to someone whose bridging allowance ran out. They told us that it could not happen. That was patently ridiculous and untrue. This young man's bridging allowance has run out. He does not come within any of the exceptional categories, so the Department refuses to make a discretionary payment ot him. He is in a bail hostel so he is already at risk of committing offences. If the Department refuses to give him any sort of income or support and he can no longer have anything from his bridging allowance, the chances must be extremely high that he will re-offend. Not only will his life be further damaged, but he will cost the community a great deal more than he would if he were able to receive income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A young woman from Blyth in Northumberland left home because of harassment from her father, who eventually told her to leave. She already had a YTS placement. She found bed and breakfast accommodation but because of her family problems she began to be a bad attender at her placement and she was eventually thrown off it. She started to receive the bridging allowance, but the council refused to pay the full amount of her bed and breakfast fee. Initially it paid only £15 towards the £55 that it was costing her. After two months of negotiations it agreed to increase the payment to £25 a week, so obviously by that time there were substantial rent arrears and she was advised to seek from the local DSS office a severe hardship payment. In the meantime, there had been a two month period in which the young woman had received first £15, then £25 towards a £55 a week rent charge. Rent arrears were building up, pressure for eviction was mounting and the young woman was very worried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The office, being helpful, rang the landlady and persuaded her not to evict the young woman because her severe hardship claim was being considered. Because the DSS locally had persuaded the landlady not to evict the young woman who had built up all those rent arrears through no fault of her own, and while she was trying to continue to be on a YTS place, the application for severe hardship was turned down because she was receiving a bridging allowance and had no imminent threat of homelessness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Minsiter in another place, Lord Skelmersdale, has confirmed that that was a correct decision because her health and security were not threatened. They may not have been threatened because the local DSS office had obtained an undertaking from the landlady not to evict her while her claim for severe hardship was being considered, but now that that claim has been rejected I am fairly confident that they will be threatened. Clearly something further will have to happen to that young woman before the Department will even consider stepping in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The last case that I want to cite in the context of severe hardship is that of a 16-year-old woman in Workington who had a young baby. The baby died a cot death. Because she had a child she had been receiv-
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
ing income support and housing benefit. When the baby died, her money was taken away. For two months she had no money at all and she made two unsuccessful suicide attempts. She is now at last receiving sickness benefit. That young woman's problems stem directly from the withdrawal of her right to benefit under the Social Security Act 1988.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 74 deals with the income that people receive if they are fortunate enough to be awarded income support on the grounds of severe hardship. I mentioned earlier that a junior rate of benefit is paid to young people, depending on their age, not their circumstances. A 16 or 17-year-old who qualifies for it receives £19.40 a week. Because of the way that the new system works, rates of income support and housing benefit are aligned. Young people who are entitled only to the junior rate of income support can have only that level of income considered in connection with their housing costs even though, if they are not in their parental home, they are competing with people of all ages for housing and do not receive a special low level of rent because of their age. Such people already suffer substantial and serious disadvantage. The evidence is that young people who are living independently are finding that their rates of benefit are completely inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cite the case of Anne, who receives £19.40 a week. She is luckier than many because she lives in a council bedsit. Her housing costs might be a good deal higher if she lived elsewhere. Her outgoings are £2.69 on housing—she still has to pay 20 per cent of her rates as the Government decided not to exempt any vulnerable groups—and £10 a week for fuel. Out of that total payment of £12.69, she if left £6.71 a week for food, clothes, personal requisites, cleaning materials, laundry, travel and entertainment. An 18-year-old called John who receives the higher rate of benefit of £26.59 and has fairly similar outgoings for housing and fuel costs is left with £11.31 a week for all expenses, including food, clothes and so on. These cases are typical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even young people who are on YTS may find themselves in serious difficulties if they have to live independently because housing benefit is age related. I cite the example of Claire who has been in care following sexual abuse by her father and cannot return home. She is better off than most people on YTS. She is on the second year of the scheme and receives £35 a week training allowance as opposed to £28.50 on the first year. She pays £10.28 for housing and has to pay housing arrears of £1.50. Her bus fares are £3 and she pays 50p a day for lunch. Her fuel bill is £10. That comes to a total of £27.78. She is left with £7.22 for her food, clothes, laundry and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities have powers to assist young people such as Claire because she has been in care. They can assist her only under section 27 of the Child Care Act 1980, and payments under that section count as income for the purpose of housing benefit. The first £5 will be ignored, but any payment over £5 reduces housing benefit. Therefore, for every £1 over £5 that the local authority gives her, she will lose 85p, because of the rate of withdrawal of housing benefit. The net effects of the Government's legislation cause serious problems for young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0370">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
If young people fall within the groups that the Government singled out as vulnerable in last year's legislation, they should at least get the full over-25 benefit rate, although many young people do not get enough benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to give the Committee a few more examples. Last year we suffered because our comments were theoretical and the Government argued that problems would not arise. Problems have indeed arisen and it is only right that we put forward the evidence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A young woman who will be 17 in April lives in the London borough of Newham. She has been in care for some years because of conflict with her mother and stepfather. She lives independently in a council bedsitter, in the ground-floor flat of a three-storey block. She has no savings, is unemployed and gets £38.80 a fortnight—£19.40 a week. Her housing costs are £15.52 in rent, £8.62 in rates and £1.21 in water rates. Her net housing costs—her 20 per cent of rates and her water rates—are £2.69 a week. She pays for her electricity by budget meter, up to £15 a fortnight. She sets aside £5 a fortnight for her gas bills, and she has £6.71 a week left. She washes her clothes in the sink because she cannot afford either a washing machine or the laundrette. She has less than a £1 a day left from her benefit to spend, as compared to a 16 year old living with his or her parents—the circumstances that the Government prefer—and on the basis of whose position the legislation was passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another young woman of 17 lost her job because she was thrown out of her home by her parents. She stayed with friends for some time and finally she contacted a local housing advice agency. She had no money and could not register for a YTS place until the following week, so the social services helped to tide her over. The advice agency managed to persuade the woman's friends to let her stay with them. It found her bed-and-breakfast accommodation and a YTS place. She is one of the successes—although not so successful as to fit into the Government's preferred category of having a happy and secure parental home. Although she is not in those circumstances, she has done what the Government want—she has found herself a YTS place and somewhere to live. Six weeks after that success story, she went back to the advice centre because she was again threatened with homelessness. Her rent was £45 a week and she received £32 a week from the DSS to cover her rent. She had to pay the outstanding amount from her YTS income, so she was left with £16 a week with which to pay bills and fares and to feed and clothe herself. Because she has a YTS place, she is much better off than the young people that I mentioned earlier, who have not been so fortunate and who are left with £5, £6 or £10 a week for their living expenses. This young woman has the princely sum of £16 a week left. I doubt whether any of the members of the Committee, with our greater age, experience and resources could manage all those other costs on £16 a week. That case comes from Brighton, where the cost of living is fairly high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that the Government are looking at this matter, and so they should. It is a pity that
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
they did not look at it before they inflicted all this pain and suffering on vulnerable young people. It has also been suggested that the changes are being monitored, so the Department may not find it possible to take action in the near future, although I hope that the Minister will tell us that that is not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that by 1990 there may be enough evidence to show how the system is working. I gather that that was suggested to local authority associations just before Christmas. We have said that 8,000 young people leave care every year, so by April 1990 some 16,000 young people may have faced such circumstances. Those are just the ones who have been in care. Others will not have been in care, but will have come under pressures at or after the age of 16 which make them leave home. It may have taken until the age of 16 for that young person to respond to the difficulties in the family home by leaving. Those difficulties may not have been identified or come to the attention of social services. There are also young people who have been successful in obtaining some sort of support from the Government, but who find it wholly inadequate to face their costs and needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is ridiculous and indefensible for us to have to wait another year. The Government were warned what would happen when they passed the legislation last year. Everything that has happened since it came into effect shows how justified those warnings were. There is no need to wait for further monitoring. The Government must tell us today what action they will take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a few days ago an article in 	<i>The Guardian</i> drew attention to the old saying about evil prospering when good men and women do nothing, or are drawn along with something that is being done. Evil also prospers when good men and women make excuses for something that they know is indefinsible. I say that not just to the Government, but to those charitable organisations which do such good work with young people, know what they are experiencing and which pull their punches because, in the face of the Government's arrogance, aggression and bullying they are afraid of being accused of being political.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Politics is the process of making decisions—how one makes money, what one does with it and how one treats people are all bound up with the process of political decision-making. The most vulnerable young people in our society have been treated disgracefully by the Government. The Government knew what they were doing, knew the risks they were running, and that they were likely to drive young people into theft, drug taking and prostitution. Yet they went ahead with the proposal because it pleased their party members, who liked to think that nobody faces problems unless it is their own fault. Of course they saved a lot of money along the way. I hope that when the debate is over, the Minister will be able to say that the Government have seen the error of their ways, and none too soon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) in moving the amendment. We seem condemned to repeat our arguments time and time again. Through reading 	<i>Hansard</i> I know that my hon. Friend used the arguments that she put this morning during the 1988 Bill and throughout the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0371">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>629</span>
whole debate on the Fowler review. Therefore, I make no apology for repeating those points. It seems that we shall have to repeat ourselves a lot before the message gets through to the Government that they must do something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that on clause 10 we are dealing with the
	<br><blockquote><p>"availability for employment as a condition for income support".</p></blockquote>
It is worth reiterating at every opportunity that the Bill's purpose is to offer people alternatives and job opportunities—as they would put it—but at any level of remuneration. In other words, it is a real and deliberate attempt to price young and old people into work. In September 1988 it was established that 16 and 17-year-olds should not be entitled to income support as of right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When my hon. Friends put forward their arguments, the Government assured us that our particular worries would not come about, and that income support did not relate to housing benefit, which was a different issue. The Government have been able to say that youngsters do not need income support because YTS places will be available. However, that does not provide a solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last April, when income support and housing benefit schemes were aligned, housing benefit became age-related. In other words, the amount of housing benefit now payable depends not only on the amount of income a person receives and the amount of the housing cost, but also on that person's age—especially in relation to hostel charges. As with income support, the result is that only those over the age of 25 receive the full amount; those aged 18 to 24 receive less, and 16 and 17-year-olds less still.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are not isolated cases for which we have scoured the case books. They are regular examples of how the system is working. A young person who has been in care following sexual abuse by her father, and who cannot return home, is on the second year of a YTS place. Her training allowance is £35 per week and her outgoings are as follows. Housing costs after housing benefit were £10.28, housing arrears were £1.50, bus fares to YTS workplace £3, lunches at work—at 50p per day—£2.50, for gas and electricity. Therefore, her total expenditure was £27.78. That young person was left with just £7.22 to buy all her food, clothes, personal effects, cleaning materials, laundry, travel and any leisure that she could get out of that amount. That is the amount that people have to live on. I wonder how many times we shall have to spell out the figures in the Committee before the Government take them seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Already we are receiving reports that the ET scheme is having a poor take-up. Even the Government would concede that it is not as successful as they hoped. On 9 November 1988 the Government admitted that more than 13,000 young people were still looking for YTS places, but had not yet been found them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further reports have been evidence of what has happened since September 1988. The Barnardo's report before Christmas gave a graphic account of what was happening to young people. I recall that my right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Wythenshaw (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
Morris) raised the matter at Prime Minsiter's Question Time, but did not receive a reply that suggested the regulations needed changing. Before Christmas I raised the issue of hostels and the fact that young people were not able to go to hostels because of the effect of housing benefit changes. When I put that question to the Prime Minister, she replied that there were plenty of places in Centrepoint, proving that she did not even understand the issue that had been raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Lady wood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will be aware, as I am, that those who run hostels for homeless young people are terrified of the changes that the Minister is initiating, which would lead to the closure of hostels and even more homeless and vulnerable young people ending up on the streets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The impact of the regulations will drive young people not only onto the streets but into difficulty and crime. Many voluntary bodies that work hard to provide such provision feel that they are not in a strong position—I sympathise with them—to challenge proposals in such a Bill because they are registered charities, and cannot be seen to criticies and be campaigning politically, as the Government would see it. Therefore, they have to pick up the pieces after the legislation has been passed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because of their experience over the past 10 years, many charitable organisations are now frightened to open their mouths about political change because their funding will be called into question by the Government or, because of pressure exerted by the Government, by local authorities. That is a diminution of freedom of speech across society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend highlights another crucial point. We await with interest the review of charity law by the Government. Groups within the voluntary sector are worried that their activities will be curtailed because they will be defined as political if they work on an aspect of social policy—such as housing the homeless—that the Government find unacceptable. Monitoring has been carried out. The Barnardo's report and the campaign for the homeless and rootless provide graphic, vivid, daily and monthly evidence of what has happened to young people as a result of proposals that were put forward at the beginning of the Fowler review in 1984, and implemented in a process that continued to the 1988 Act. They are now being re-encoded in this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend recall that exactly one week ago, my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall) asked the Prime Minister what action the Government were to take? He quoted a report from the Association of the Directors of Social Services which drew attention to the plight of those young people. It talks of them going into a half-life of drug dependency, prostitution and so on. The answer from the Prime Minister repeated the parrot cry of the last general election, about how tough the Government intend to be with young people. She said that the Government were not going to become soft and that they were keen on young people going out to work and not sleeping in bed. That is a slight paraphrase of the remarks of holy writ that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0372">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
came from the lips of the right hon. Lady. That was her intention just one week ago: she was totally unmoved by the vast amount of evidence from Barnado's and elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Perhaps we should ask the Minister whether the Prime Minister has called him in and said a word in his ear. Alghough, as my hon. Friend reminds us, she is holding a tough line, I watched with a mixture of anger and encouragement a television programme on Sunday called "On the Record" on which some Back Bench Conservative Members suddenly discovered that there was an error in the regulations. That created the impression that different parts of the regulations did not quite knit together, so there was a need for a consolidation Bill to sort out social security. Those hon. Members were in a hostel, looking at facilities for young people, who were telling them what was happening. At least they were there listening to the young people, and that is encouraging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, some of my hon. Friends, as well as voluntary sector bodies, have been spelling out for years what the impact of the changes would be. I felt angry watching that programme because I felt that those Conservative Members had discovered rather late in the day what we have been saying for a long time. Those same Members went through the Lobby to vote against amendments moved by Labour Members that made exactly that point. That was not pointed out in the programme. Perhaps that is the level of cynicism to which politics can degenerate these days, but we should check the record and put the facts straight so that we do not simply pretend that there is a little bit of adjustment here and there, and a few people get damaged in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was on the programme, and I was slightly encouraged by his reply, which seemed to suggest not the Prime Minister's hard line—that the Government would be tough on young people and they should get themselves onto schemes—but that he would consider the matter. I was reminded of the Adjournment debate in the House on housing benefit on 22 December. The Under-Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would be the first to acknowledge that the benefit system, especially as it affects young people living away from their family, does not give them a great deal to live on."</p></blockquote>
Perhaps the facts and figures of people's budgets that we have been putting forward have been getting through to Ministers. I welcome that. The Under-Secretary continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The essential characteristic of young people, especially in the 16 to 17-year age group, is that they live at home with their parents. Therefore, the only way to help people…who live away from their parents would also be to give an incentive generally for people to move away from home. We recognise that there are circumstances in which people do have to move out, but we would not want to create such an incentive."</p></blockquote>
The impression that he gave was that exceptions could not be made because that gave people an incentive. The problem seems insoluble, the Under-Secretary continued:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
11.30 am
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have given a commitment to monitoring the effects of the reforms and we shall of course be looking at the effects the changes are having on this group as well as others."</p></blockquote>
The evidence exists. The voluntary bodies and the social services departments throughout the country have been providing that evidence. How long will the monitoring go on? the Under-Secretary concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If changes are necessary, and if changes are sensible within the basic simpler structure, the Government will make them."— 	<i>[Official Report.</i> 22 December 1988: Vol 144. c.622-3.]</p></blockquote>
When will they make those changes? The Bill and our amendments provide an opportunity to do precisely that. Let us not have another 12 months of monitoring. Let us not have more questions at Prime Minister's Question Time about the impact of the changes on hostel provision. Let us not wait for the next annual report from Barnardo's to tell us what is going on. Let us have action now. One local authority social services department said that the confusion surrounding the benefit changes had
	<br><blockquote><p>"greatly increased pressure on vulnerable young people to make major life decisions in very short periods of time. (There is a) real likelihood of increased crime to maintain income and a feeling of nothing much to lose'".</p></blockquote>
I read in a different light over the weekend. For the past few months I have been heavily involved with Armley gaol, which is in my constituency. It is the most overcrowded prison in Britain. Since last October there have been five suicides of your remand prisoners; aged 17, 18 and 19 who had been waiting to go before the courts. There have also been many attempted suicides by young people in that prison. A mother—a single parent—came to one of my advice surgeries. Her son could not get a job or a training place and had not gone to sign on and she had to support him. He moved out and she did not know where he was. The next thing she heard was that he was picked up for stealing cars. When he was before the magistrates she was so distraught that she signed against bail and signed him into Armley because at least then she would know where he was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear for young people when the only alternative is remand. This benefit system closes rather than opens up their options and we should therefore take some responsibility for the decisions that are made in Committee. Our discussions on the detail of these Bills are not broadcast far and wide; they do not hit the headlines of the popular newspapers. They emerge only later. Nearly five years after some of us pointed out the impact of such changes, it is revealed on television. We should take responsibility for our actions because our decisions now and on Report could have a major impact on people's lives. I hope that the Government will realise that what has happened to 16 and 17-year-olds has been disastrous for them. I hope that the Government will be able to accept the amendments and build back into the law the original provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillian Shephard 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Norfolk, South-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to draw the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister to a small category of peculiarly vulnerable young people. In passing, I point out to the Opposition that even they have had to recognise that the Government have shown their appreciation of the vulnerability of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0373">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
young people in the categories listed in the schedules. Moreover, they have made provision for an appeal to the Secretary of State on grounds of severe hardship, which has also been mentioned by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members would say that even vulnerable young people should be expected to benefit from an appropriate YTS project, although there will be exceptions. We would not be doing young people a service if we assumed from the outset that they could not benefit from joining an approporiate scheme. However, it is important to have a structure to catch those who cannot benefit and the five categories constitute such a structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have given examples of how the structure is not working as it should. My hon. Friend the Minister will undoubtedly take careful note of those examples, but they do not alter the principle that we should expect all those who, for whatever reason, are going through a vulnerable period of their lives to take advantage of a training opportunity. It is necessary to have the safety net and the catch-all provision of direct appeal to the Secretary of State, but we must also expect young people to benefit from training opportunities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should acknowledge that we did not say that many young people would not benefit from good YTS training, although we would question whether it is always good. That is not the same as saying that all rights to income should be taken away from them unless they join such a scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear that the hon. Lady accepts part of our argument. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said that the way the system works must be examined. That gives force to the point that my hon. Friend the Minister will undoubtedly make about the need to monitor. We cannot know how the system is working unless it is analysed and monitored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to add to the examples already given by the Opposition. It concerns a small, vulnerable category, of people who may be, but are not recognised as, mentally ill. In the extremely rare cases of young people who may be schizophrenic or have some other form of mental disorder, their behaviour during childhood and adolescent may cause them to be categorised by educational agencies, social services and even the medical profession as having a behavioual problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That category was brought to my attention by the case of a young woman who came to see me in my surgery. In her case, the system had been working well until the point at which she was obliged to see me. She had been fostered because of her behavioural problems, but it had been unsuccessful and the social services department had placed her in a flat, which it loosely supervised. Although that was relatively successful, she was also expected to take a YTS place. She was accepted on two YTS projects but, again, because of her behaviour, she was rejected by those schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a clinician but I have worked closely for a long time with mentally-ill people and I think that that

girl was mentally ill. In such a case, a quick diagnosis is needed so that the young person can be categorised as mentally ill. She would then fall into one of the five categories instead of being categorised as having behavioural problems. A wealth of evidence from the young woman's educational background and from social workers and medical officers would have supported the fact that she was mentally ill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems is that people under 18 are not normally sectioned as being mentally ill under the Mental Health Act 1983. A young person may be rejected from a YTS—and therefore be unable to receive income support—because of an undiagnosed medical problem. When the working of the Act is monitored, that reason should be considered so that people can be categorised under one of the five categories of exemption, and therefore be entitled to income support. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can reassure us that it will be considered, either in regulations, in an advisory note or in advice to agencies so that they can work together more quickly and appropriately to diagnose those cases. We are concerned about a tiny, but vulnerable group of ill young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to set the context of the distressing and appalling individual cases that we have considered this morning. It is well known that in Birmingham, London and in all our major cities prostitution is increasing among young men and women. Those who study such matters know that young people who have been sexually abused often end up as prostitutes because their notion of sexuality has been so belittled. Studies show that low alternative income is one of the major reasons for people entering prostitiution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Britain is the 15th richest country in the world. Many of our young people have been abused in their families, have never had a proper childhood and work on the streets of Birmingham and London partly because of the meanness in of our benefit system. That is shocking, and we should do better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ten years ago, the structure of benefit for young people was such that any young person who left school became entitled immediately to benefit at the full, single person's benefit rate. That framework was essential to our concept of freedom of choice. Everyone was entitled to a minimum income with freedom to choose the job or training that suited them. The guaranteed income was low—there was no incentive to live on it—but it was a backstop so that everyone had some choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over a long time, the Government have set about dismantling that framework. They want young people to have lower wage expectations and to go into schemes that they might otherwise find unacceptable. The Government have falsely stated the facts and realities of youth unemployment. When unemployment is rising, youth unemployment rises more quickly than the general rate. That is not surprising because young people are on the margins of the labour market, and are new entrants to it. Therefore, in difficult times it will not be easy for new entrants to the labour market. When unemployment falls, youth unemployment falls more rapidly than the general rate.

	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
For all the years that school leavers had a guaranteed right to benefit we had a low youth unemployment rate. Youth unemployment started to rise as unemployment took off, and it rose more quickly than the general rate. Schemes such as the youth opportunities programme and YTS were born. The statistics show that the number of refusals of offers of places on schemes was minute. Even under the youth opportunities programme—which the Government said was inadequate and so they introduced YTS—the refusals ran at around 3 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Government found it necessary to move from freedom of choice to compulsion. Were the Government anxious to remove young people's freedom of choice simply because 3 per cent, had the cheek to refuse places on YTS? Were the Government as irrational as that? We must appreciate that the answer is no. The Government were desperate to reduce YTS allowances to cut the costs of benefits. As benefit levels are people's bottom line, the Government had to erode them to force people onto schemes and to accept a low allowance on such shcemes. People looking for training will not accept any old rubbish and they will want a level of income at least as good, if not better, than their benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr Tebbit) was Secretary of State for Employment, he tried to introduce a £15 a week allowance for YTS and to abolish young people's right to benefit. There was such a fuss throughout the country, and from youth organisations and trades unions that he had to back off. Cutting the YTS allowance and abolishing the right to benefit go together, because otherwise no sensible person would be willing to go on YTS. The right hon Member for Chingford had to back off, but the Government are clever. If they are beaten once, they wait, and then come back again. They have continued with the plan, but with more subtlety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have eroded young people's right to benefit. First, the Government abolished young people's right to benefit during the holiday period after they leave school. They then cut the contribution to young people's housing costs. Entitlement to bed and breakfast accommodation was cut, so young people have to run around the country and can stay in one place for only a short time when they look for work. Finally, the Government have done it. They have abolished young people's entire right to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that Conservative Members are otherwise decent and sensitive people. They refer to the undesir-ability of young people doing nothing and staying in bed and to how much more desirable it would be for them to go on training schemes. Yet only 3 per cent have refused YTS places. The Government's argument is a nonsense and a lie, yet it is used as an excuse for cutting the benefits and incomes of young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon Friend the Member for Derby, South mentioned the 16-year-old who had a baby—which must be difficult enough for a 16-year-old—which died. Immediately after the baby died, the 16-year-old's benefit was taken away because she was not longer in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
category of hardship and entitled to money. It is no surprise that the young woman atempted to commit suicide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to face the truth. My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South mentioned the fact that voluntary organisations have not reminded the Government of their hypocrisy or of the fact that Conservative Members have voted for that system. We all get into the craven position of pleading for something better because the situation is so desperate. Therefore, we try to persuade the Government and be nice to them. We are not allowed to be angry with them, denounce them or say that all this hardship is deliberate. I want to put on record the fact that it is deliberate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all hope for concessions from the Minister today, and it will be incredibly shocking if we do not get them. However, even if we get concessions for that small group of young people who face terrible hardships that none of us imagined we should see in our country again, it is still not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eastern Europe is yearning for a change in its system. It wants a greater freedom of choice, a pluralism, and a right for people to choose how they spend their lives. Using the rhetoric of freedom, the Government are deeply eroding freedom. To cut benefits and save money on public expenditure, the right of young people to choose which job or YTS place to take has been removed. There has been an enormous reduction in freedom and the Government should be ashamed. We are grateful for the concessions that the Minister will make but they will not be good enough. Everyone should have the minimum income necessary to survive so that they can make free choices between training schemes and jobs. Only a Government who do not believe in the people and who do not believe their own research which repeatedly shows that young people are hunting for jobs and training would diminish freedom in such an undesirable way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This morning, we have seen the miraculous power of light. The power of speech has been miraculously restored by a light appearing above the door. That happened in the Committee discussing the British Steel Act 1988 where for 80 hours not one Conservative Back Bencher contributed to the debate. This morning, when the light that says "Broadcasting" appeared, we heard a worthwhile contribution from a Conservative Member. We appreciate the contribution that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. Shephard) made using her great knowledge of the subject.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not harder for Government Back Benchers to speak when the light is on than when it is off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend may have a point. Perhaps the hon. Lady's contribution is in conflict with my theory about her reason for speaking. However it has been the experience of Committees in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady used the word "monitor". Has not all the evidence that has come from Barnardo's and other sources established that we have a crisis now? A large number of people have no income, no job, no YTS

place and no hope. They are the most vulnerable group in our society. The hon. Member for Norfolk, Southwest spoke of a safety net. In theory there is a safety net but it is full of gaping holes. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) said that orphans could not join their parents but, sadly, many have tried to do just that and some have succeeded. This is the time of maximum self-destruction among young people when the paths chosen lead either to a fulfilling life or to hell. With one voice the associations point out how we are creating social outcasts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unbelievably a new generation of vagrants is appearing. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) pointed out last week how many of us are accosted by beggars, which is something that we thought we would never see again in this country. Young people's lives are destroyed by drugs and crime. That group is pitifully inadequate in so many cases. Of the young people in Centrepoint, 25 per cent have been in care. They have lost out all along the line, but the Government choose to use on them not persuasion or compassion but the stick of retribution. The Conservatives use malice because they have to seem macho and tough on these young people who they suspect stay in bed till noon and do not look for work. That group have suffered greatly from the omission. It cannot be a question of monitoring. The evidence is there. It is overwhelming and unanswerable and even Tory Back Benchers have drawn attention to it. The only answer we can accept from the Minister is, "Peccavi, I have sinned and am about to make amends".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments have nothing to do with the measures that the Government are taking in this Bill. However, I do not complain about their having been tabled nor about the passion and level of argument that has been used by Opposition Members and I am not unsympathetic to a number of the points that have been raised in the debate. I am not able to respond to the range of individual cases, but I shall study them carefully in the context of the current monitoring exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems from the Minister's reply that these cases are new to him. Has not the Barnardo's report already put together a series of cases? Surely the information is not new to him and a pattern has already emerged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that later in my remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The important point that my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. Shephard) made was that the structure of support for 16 and 17-year-olds is sound. The underlying philosophy is correct. There is a saying in the legal profession about hard cases making bad law. That does not mean that we should dismiss the hard cases. The broad structure of support for 16 and 17-year-olds, and the encouragement to take up the opportunities offered by the youth training scheme will continue but we should study carefully the growing evidence of hardship being caused to a small group within that overall category of 16 and 17-year-olds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What was the previous figure for refusal on YTS? Can the Minister confirm that it was 3 per cent? Why was all this necessary when young people were willingly taking up YTS places? We do not accept his underlying philosophy. There is no excuse or reason for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference between us here. I can think of few worse starts to life for 16 and 17-year-olds who can avail themselves of educational, employment or training opportunities to have an encouragement, however slight, to begin their life on benefit. My constituency includes Earl's Court. Any suggestion that dangers to young people from drugs, prostitution or crime began in April or September 1988 is an absolute fallacy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It got worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We leave the Minister to judge what the scene is like in Earl's Court. Will he accept that although that may not have changed, what he has seen for many years in Earl's Court is now a common occurrence in many other parts of London and in many other cities around the country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Iain MacLeod used to say, "Do not interrupt me at a comma". I had just reached a comma in my speech. I recognise that there is a growing weight of evidence that more young people are suffering those dangers, which is one of the reasons for a comment that I shall make in a few minutes' time. So my first point is that the proposition that that started in 1988 is wrong. It was there before, and I know from my experience from Crisis at Christmas and Youth Aid that those dangers have existed for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps on his second point the Minister will knock down something that we actually said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The second point that I want to knock down is that the change was a geat cost-saving exercise. The Government looked at the needs of 16 and 17-year-olds and introduced the Youth Training Scheme. Any savings that were made on the benefit arrangements were vastly exceeded by the cost of the Youth Training Scheme, which will be of great benefit to that age group as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right on the very short-term figures for the final move, but if he looks at what would have happened if the YOP and YTS allowances and benefits had been maintained at their original rates, I hope that he will confirm that there has been a massive saving.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the point when we came to the new arrangements there was no question of saving. Extra resources were put in so that the youth training scheme could get off to a good start. The youth training scheme has got off to a good start, and in Great Britain as a whole there are still nearly 137,000 unfilled places—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

comma, is he going to deal with the distance that some people have to travel? There are YTS places in Inverness, but people in Skye have to travel 150 miles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a shame that the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) is not present. It has been a long tradition that people from the Scottish islands travel across to the mainland for work, education and training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one disputes that, but young people are being asked to travel 150 miles and there are no lodgings for them in Inverness. What is the Minister going to do about that? Was he going to say, when he had passed his comma, that it would all be part of the wonderful monitoring process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If young people have to travel long distances for a YTS place, they can get help with their travelling and accommodation costs on top of their training allowance. People from remote areas have traditionally had to travel considerable distances, not just for employment, but for education and training. There is nothing new about that. Of course we want young people to have training opportunities as close to their homes as possible, but there are now unfilled vacancies in every region so good quality training places are available for the majority of young people who are not yet on YTS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that in many areas people travel long distances. But will the Minister accept that in circumstances where there are no lodgings for young people in the areas where they can pick up their YTS places, they should not be expected to go there and rough it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has suggested that there are no lodgings available in one particular place. I can neither confirm nor deny that. There are all sorts of opportunities. Private arrangements can be made for accommodation. It might be better for young people to be in the sort of arrangement made between families and so on rather than attempting to live independently.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it would be wrong for the state to require 16-year-olds to leave home in order to get a place on a YTS and some income? It would be wrong if we arranged our society in that way and if some 16-year-olds could not carry on living with their families.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not necessarily say that in every case. Many young people, certainly from the islands, have travelled from their education. Training opportunities are an extension of that and I think that young people will benefit from them. It will reflect a pattern that many of them will find when they come to their full working life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In those circumstances the children have gone to boarding school. Does the Minister not accept that there is a difference between sending children to boarding school and the parents knowing that
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
they will be looked after and sending 16 or 17-year-olds to towns where there is said to be no lodgings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect, that is not always the case. Some have left and gone to boarding school; others have stayed in other homes and gone to day schools on the mainland. It has by no means always been the case that education has been confined to boarding opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 73 would amend the legislation that we enacted last year, and that was much debated at the time. The position under the law as it stands is clear to the Committee. While most 16 and 17-year-olds are not entitled to income support, we ensured that the two most vulnerable groups that we identified were given protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first group comprises those who are, for instance, lone parents or young people who, because of disability, cannot work or take advantage of the guarantee of the offer of a YTS place. That group is entitled at all times to income support, subject to the normal rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second group—the one that we are concerned with today—is made up of those who are capable of work or training but who have no parent or cannot live at home for one reason or another. The risk of sexual or physical abuse is one category that has been mentioned more than once this morning. That group is entitled to income support, as the Committee knows, for a short period. That period is known as the child benefit extension period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would give entitlement to income support without time limit to all young people who fall into that second category. A technical defect in the amendment would mean that it would not achieve its object in practice, but I shall stick to the intention behind the amendment rather than quibble about technical details.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nothing that I have heard this morning would convince me—nor, I suspect, by hon. Friends—that we should believe that a reliance on state benefits for those who are capable of work and training is either desirable or necessary. Those young people who do not continue in education or find a job have the opportunity to apply for a YTS place. We believe that that offers a much better start to life than income support. We have guaranteed the YTS place and we have honoured that guarantee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young people who cannot live with their parents should not be exempt from the requirement that they should be available for YTS. If they are capable of work and training, I can see no possible advantage in extending income support entitlement beyond the period that is already available to them. That gives young people at least 12 weeks or so to sort themselves out—more for summer school leavers. Therefore, I cannot commend the amendment to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 74 would provide that in certain circumstances, 16 and 17-year-olds and others under the age of 25 would get a higher rate of income support than others in their age group. The majority of claimants who are under 25 live with their families or in someone else's household. For them, the income sup
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
port rates are more than adequate. For a number of other claimants, who decide to live independently—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, although I can see that his principle of giving way is becoming much strained. Is he aware that among unemployed young people, the chances of the parents with whom they live being unemployed are disproportionately high? We cannot assume that young people who live with their family are living with a family that has a reasonable income. There is often unemployment among parents in areas and in groupings where there is unemployment among young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be so in some circumstances, but I think that the general principle certainly is true. Most people on income support who are living in their own homes have a level of support that is adequate for their needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) has put her finger on an important point. Unemployed youngsters often live with unemployed parents. That being so—many hon. Members will have come across it—it is extremely important to break the cycle. That is precisely what the Bill does. It will ensure that unemployment does not pass from generation to generation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. Such youngsters will benefit more than most from the opportunities of a first-class training scheme. The hon. Lady made an excellent speech—although I do not accept all her arguments—in which she pointed out that the amendment focusses on a small group of claimants who, through force of circumstances, have to live independently. Last year, we set in train a monitoring exercise to look at the effects of the reform on all client groups. However, because of the weight of evidence, I have asked officials to take the effect of the reforms on this particular group on a faster track than we are considering the general monitoring exercise. Some features of the scheme would cause concern to anyone looking responsibly at the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about a faster track. We believe that the Government's monitoring process is stuck on the hard shoulder, with hazard lights flashing. We have emphasised the urgency of the problems of these young people. It is about time that the Minister made a decision, instead of talking about the speed of the various tracks of the managing process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the timescale in a moment, though perhaps not to the hon. Gentleman's satisfaction. I shall deal first with the question of delay in making decisions raised by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) in her opening speech. Of course it is necessary for the local offices of the Department of Social Security to obtain all the relevant information when someone applies to be treated under the severe hardship provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some examples were given of delays going beyond 24 hours. I am advised that that would occur only where some extra days were taken to obtain the basic information. However, many severe hardship cases are
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
dealt with immediately, over the telephone—from the local office to headquarters—and involve a delay of only a few minutes in getting a decision back to the claimant. Once the information has been obtained, all these decisions should be made within 24 hours, although there could be circumstances in which people have to wait a little longer in order to establish the basic facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Southwest (Mrs. Shephard) touched on the needs of a small group of people, although she acknowledged how small the group was. We shall be considering ways in which we might deal with their problems. She mentioned the fact that people under the age of 18 are not normally defined as being mentally ill or suffering from schizophrenia. We shall see whether we can find a way of dealing with their circumstances in regulations. We need to do it with great care, to make sure that we are not opening up opportunities for people to exploit the system. Certainly, I believe that evidence from schools, managing agents or the careers service could corroborate the circumstances she outlined. We shall certainly consider the point with great sympathy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How can the Minister be so confident that the problem is so small? If, by its very nature, the mental illness is undiagnosed, how can he or the hon. Lady say that it is a tiny problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we consider the incidence of mental illness within the community and then consider this restricted age group, we cannot be talking about vast numbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gillian Shephard</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is statistically small as the hon. Member for Birkenhead knows well through his work with the Health Service. He knows that the incidence of mental illness among the adult population is small. By extension, he must also expect that it is small among the child and adolescent population. My concern is about the difficulty in differentiating between behaviour problems and mental illness, as the hon. Gentleman knows well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, I had asked the Department to speed up the process of monitoring those youngsters. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I recently met a group of voluntary organisations involved in meeting their needs. They included Barna-do's and National Children's Home. Any idea that they were intent on pulling their punches in presenting evidence to us was far from the truth. They were strong, vigorous and convincing, and made a compelling case. Therefore, we shall consider urgently all the evidence on the needs of those groups.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not mentioned the distressing examples of young people who have been sexually abused and are then interrogated by young civil servants with no training in such matters. I understand that his Department issues regulations about the nature of interviews. Will he make those available to us and undertake to deal specifically with that problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, I missed that point although I

intended to come to it. It could be tackled in several ways. At present, young people who fall under the severe hardship provision could be interviewed by anyone who mans the counters. They need rather more sympathy and understanding because of the nature of their background and what they may have suffered. Perhaps one, two or three officials within the office could be given special training and designated to deal with those cases. I cannot give an absolute undertaking that we shall do that, but there is a strong argument for giving such people special help and counselling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not Opposition Members continually raising cases which, under any circumstances, would be considered extremely hard? We all know that such cases make bad law. If people are applying for special help because they have been sexually abused, that is a criminal offence and the police should be able to verify it. That would assist the officers who are trying to make a decision. Otherwise, how can we know whether allegations of sexual abuse are justified?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have seen recently, establishing the veracity of allegations of sexual abuse can be difficult and can take much longer—whatever action the police or other authorities may be able to take—than a decision to grant benefit. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) finds this amusing. The timescale for any such operation would be too long when set against the urgency to make a judment about the needs of a youngster who is asking for help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not laughing at the Minister's response but at the question that was posed to him. It showed that people who have good intentions but only a theoretical knowledge of the world can make seemingly reasonably suggestions. People who have witnessed such families will know that it is nonsense to think that the police could be brought in and a criminal prosecution pushed for at that stage. I wish that the world worked in the simple way that the hon. Lady describes, as it would help many of my constituents. Sadly, we do not all come in those simple little boxes that make interventions in this debate so easy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We were grateful for the example of caring Conservatism from the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman). She can be excused, as she has been present for only part of the debate. However, we have examples of young people being interviewed by someone of their own age. For the first time ever, they have had to admit that they have been abused and that has greatly distressed them. They are then subjected to interrogation for the pittance that is on offer. This is not a trivial or superficial matter, but one that affects people deeply. Neither does it affect only one or two people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his reply, I hope that the Minister will say that young people who are already vulnerable and disturbed in many other ways should not, if possible, be subjected to painful, upsetting interrogation. There must be ways of avoiding it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not like interventions
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
upon interventions, particularly when the second intervention is long and disrupts our orderly debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) nevertheless made two important points. First, if claimants make allegations of sexual or physical abuse, those responsible for it should be subjected to the law. Secondly, special provision to help youngsters who are in particularly difficult circumstances should not become a door through which others can push in order to abuse the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'> Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for saying that interviewers should be more highly trained and sensitive. However, I hope he will agree that untrained Department of Social Security staff should not interrogate young people about allegations of sexual abuse. When that is put forward as the reason for not living at home, there must be a way to contact the social services and so on. I hope that the Minister will look into that, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that Department of Social Security staff would not do more than necessary to establish the basic facts of the case. They would certainly need other advice and support, rather than conduct a long interrogation about someone's alleged circumstances. However, I shall examine the point that the hon. Lady has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) have said that, as I have all the evidence and know what must be done, I should now tell the Committee what will be done. I cannot go that far. I want the Department's considered view about the scope and nature of the problem. I shall then try to break it down into its components to see how it can be solved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a young person goes to the Department of Social Security and accuses his parents of sexual abuse, and that has not been reported to the police, it demands investigation. Young as well as old people can be evil. As Opposition Members said, many young people are hooked on drugs and such people lie to obtain money. Allegations of sexual abuse should not simply be passed over without investigation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I touched on that point in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay and I shall not retread that ground. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) makes an important point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seized of this problem and shall seek to break it down sensibly to decide what is necessary to meet the concerns that have been expressed this morning and the weight of evidence from those directly involved in the welfare of this small but extremely vulnerable group of young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I am conscious that Opposition Members want me to be more specific, the work is in hand and I hope that it will not be too long before I can say what conclusions we have reached. It is more important to get the right answer than to try to meet the artificial deadline imposed by the hon. Member for Leeds, West this morning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Does he need more than three months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may know better than I when Report stage will be.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful for the remarks of the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. She-phard) and for her identification of another group of young people who may be hit by the legislation. My gratitude is tempered by my recollection that the hon. Lady served on the Committee that considered the Social Security Act 1988. She heard the Opposition identifying the problems that would arise, but she voted against our amendment. I have little doubt that she will do so again today. Therefore, my gratitude is tempered by that recollection, although the hon. Lady made a good point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that hard cases make bad law, and the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) repeated that. It is evident that this bad law is based entirely on the 2 per cent to 3 per cent of hard cases who are said to have refused offers of YTS places. In drafting the Bill, the Government have taken a tiny handful of 16 and 17-year-olds, blown them up into a myth which serves the interests of Conservatives, and they have made bad law. We wish to mitigate the effects of that bad law. The Minister is turning the facts on their heads by trying to pretend that somehow the flaw lies in those vulnerable young people who are being caught by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that there are few worse starts in life than to be encouraged to begin life on benefits. Whatever worse starts there are, and however bad a start people can have, there is little doubt that the vulnerable groups of young people that we are discussing experience most of them. There is no contention about that in the Committee. Those young people have already had their worst start—they are already in considerable difficulties before the legislaton hits them. The question is whether withdrawing benefit—which the Minister is pleased to call encouragement not to live on benefits—is helpful and beneficial to the young people or whether it is another hurdle, obstacle and problem with which they must cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition have never suggested that dangers from crime, prostitution and drug addiction began with the passage of the legislation. That would be a stupid thing to say, and we are neither stupid nor ill-informed. Last year we told the Government—and we repeat it today—that this legislation has exacerbated the problems. It makes it more likely that young people from whom all income and support is removed will drift, into or be encouraged into, crime, prostitution, drug addiction and that desperate cycle of deprivation which poses a danger not only to them, but to society. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
Minister said that he recognised the growing weight of evidence that more young people are drfting in that direction. I am sorry to say that we were correct to predict that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it was unfair to suggest that the Government had changed the law to make savings, or to remove people from the unemployment register, because the savings vastly exceeded the cost of YTS. But YTS did not begin last year either. It already existed. I am surprised that the Minister can now tell us that he has quantified the cost of providing extra YTS places and that it is more than the savings made from withdrawing the right to benefit. Last year he could not quantify how much extra the Government expected to spend on YTS against the £84 million savings that they could quantify precisely. No information has been forthcoming about that, but the Government will doubtless make a net saving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) and for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) touched a nerve when they pressed the Minister on the question of young people being forced to travel a considerable distance to Inverness, where there are no lodgings, to take up a YTS place. The Minister was asked whether he would accept that it was wrong to require a 16-year-old to leave home. He said that he certainly would not accept that it was wrong, and that that was often the pattern of work in the islands anyway. That shows us how facts are being turned on their heads when the Minister talks about bad cases and framing the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is not about the bad cases, but about what the Government claim are the vast majority of young people, who should and do live at home—who have parental homes in which they can stay. The Government believe that 16 and 17-year olds should live in their parental homes, except when it happens not to suit the Government, such as when that parental home is in the islands and the YTS places are in Inverness. In that case the Government argue that young people should not be able to live at home. The Minister turned his argument on its head. The framework of the compulsion that the Government have imposed on young people rests on the withdrawal of benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Lady seriously suggesting that, if young people choose not to live at home, the state should support them to live elsewhere?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on the circumstances. The case that was put to the Minister is not of people choosing to look for YTS places some considerable distance away from their homes, as indeed they may wish to do, but is of the state compelling young people to do that in the knowledge that those young people will have to leave home, possibly to go to a place where there are no lodgings. The thrust of the legislation is that young people should not leave home, but the Government will switch from one argument to the other when it suits their case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cannot the hon. Lady see the distinction between people leaving home to take up training
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0380">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
places that will fit them for future employment, and people leaving home to live on state benefit without the support of their families? There must be a distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Cannot the Minister see the difference between people leaving home to take up suitable training, jobs, or opportunities that will fit them for careers, and people being forced to leave their parental homes because if they do not, the Government will withdraw all income from them and may penalise their parents? That is also an important distinction. Some people are being forced to leave home to take up YTS places, yet the Government claim that YTS places are available everywhere. The Government switch the argument depending on what suits them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Skye and Inverness examples are not the only ones. The Government keep on saying that there is a surplus of YTS places, but they will not assure us that those YTS places are in neighbourhoods in which young people live, so that they may choose to stay with their families and have a decent relationship with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right that Inverness is only the most potent example because the lodgings that young people need are unavailable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why my hon. Friend suggested that the Government had asserted that there would be YTS places wherever they are needed, but that is not what the Government actually said. Last year, the Government refused point blank to give any assurance that YTS places would be available in sufficient numbers in particular localities. The Government said that the Department of Employment assured them that enough YTS places would be available if people were prepared to travel. The Government have drafted legislation that relies on there being enough YTS places available, but they have rested their case on national YTS places without considering whether those places are available in different localities. They have not considered whether those places are safe and offer good training or any other criteria that the Opposition, at least, would wish to see apply to training places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about it being undesirable for those capable of work or training to rely on benefits. He is answering a case that has not been put. No Opposition Member wants young people to waste their lives in idleness and drift about with no useful prospects before them. Equally, none of us wants them drifting about in a so-called YTS place that is merely a compulsory way of passing the time or of being exploited when there is no useful training opportunity and there is unlikely to be a better job opportunity in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a question not of whether people who are capable of work or training are allowed to rely on benefit but of whether work and training are available. That is what matters. The Government's crime is not only to fail to provide jobs and good training opportunities because they are not prepared to spend the necessary money but to penalise young people because those good jobs and training opportunities are not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
The Minister said that young people should not be exempt from being available for YTS. I specifically drew attention when moving the amendment to the fact that we do not suggest that they should not have to register for YTS or work or whatever. We do not say that young people should be encouraged to remain idle and we would like nothing better than for a range of opportunities to be available to them. It is wrong for the Government to pretend otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course young people should be available for YTS but, as we have said repeatedly, many are not accepted for YTS places or, because of their problems, lose their places. Things go wrong, which may not be unrelated to the fact that they do not know whether they will be entitled to benefit. They do not know whether they will continue to draw income and they know that that income is likely to be insufficient anyway to meet their housing costs. Any of us who at any stage of our lives faced with doubt about whether we had anywhere to live or whether our income was enough to pay the bills would also have difficulty holding down our job and doing it well. We are talking about young people at the earliest stage of the transition from childhood to training, work and adulthood; yet we expect them to cope with that package of problems without the help and support which we argue should be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he was prepared to monitor the effects of the level of income that people in this vulnerable group receive on a faster track. I would be more impressed by that undertaking if there were the slightest indication of what it meant. Presumably, it means that the indications that came from the local authority associations that the general principle of these changes will not be considered until April 1990 were correct and that the Minister feels that it might be rather difficult to defend not doing anything until April 1990 so he will do something on a faster track. What that will be is still to be revealed to the Committee, the House and the world. It will no doubt be so wondrous that we shall boggle at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as I can see, there is no assurance in what the Minister has said, save that the Department has been told that there is a problem and that it will be prepared to look with rather more speed than it might otherwise have done at the levels of income awarded. We are grateful for very small mercies. We hope that the Minister will give us some information and advice on Report. If he does not, it will mean further delay while regulations are passed or while changes are made in the legislation. What the Minister has said does not answer the question of principle in amendment No. 73—whether some groups of young people should receive benefit as of right because they already fall into a vulnerable group. He also said nothing about the advice that is available in local DSS offices on whether hardship claims can be made and whether decisions about such claims are taken on the basis of proper professional advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about the most insecure group of young people in our society who have had all their rights to income removed by a law based on the hard cases of a tiny handful of young people who neither looked for work nor accepted YTS places. The Minister spoke about not placing an artificial deadline on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0381">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
period of time when he has to consider what the Government will do about it, but an artificial deadline is placed on these young people. There is a deadline of 12 weeks or less during which they can receive benefit. If they satisfy the Department that they are suffering severe hardship, an artificial deadline is placed on them. Their case has to be looked at repeatedly and they have to go through the trauma of establishing their hardship over and over again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are young people who fall outside the framework of the Government's cosy image. The Government believe that 16 and 17-year-olds should live at home in a comfortable and loving environment where there is a decent income and they can be secure. At that age we are all still young and comparatively vulnerable. The young people to whom the amendments relate cannot live at home either because they do not have a home and have not had a home for years, perhaps since babyhood, or because their home is not a safe and fit place for them to be. What the Minister has said this morning is wholly inadequate to deal with those cases. It will do nothing to help those young people who are in danger now or next month or the month after that or until the Department finally decides the minimum that the Government can get away with. That is what we are talking about—the minimum that the Government can get away with to justify this clause. The Minister's response has been completely unsatisfactory and I urge my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the advantage of taking these amendments together, as they have similar aims. They would get rid of one of the rigidities that the Government are trying to create.—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I notice that I have excited the hon. Member for Biller-icay (Mrs. Gorman) into speech again. I have an extraordinary effect on her. She has obviously set out to disrupt me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to our efforts to make the rigidity in the Bill more flexible. The amendment deals with one aspect of the treatment of work expenses in the calculation of entitlement to means tested benefits. The matter has had a great deal of attention and the Secretary of State recently led us to believe that he, too, was worried about it. Amendment No. 130 would allow child care costs to be deducted when calculating the net earnings of a single parent on income support. In the happy, far-off days before April 1988, child care costs and other work expenses were taken into account when calculating entitlement to supplementary support but not to family income supplement or housing benefit. That seemed to be reasonable, as they are genuine costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the Government's declared aims in replacing those benefits with income support, family credit and the new housing benefit scheme was to introduce a single set of rules on the treatment of income and capital. Unfortunately, they chose to apply family income supplement rules rather than supplementary benefit rules in the treatment of work expenses in their failed quest for simplification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill provides that lone parents can earn up to £15 a week without loss of income support, but any work expenses—including child care—must come out of that £15. A mother who takes a part-time job and spends more than £15 on child minding, fares to work and other work expenses will have her income support reduced by more than her net earnings. She will therefore be worse off than if she were not working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must see how persuasive the amendments are, as they will contribute to another of their prime goals: not necessarily to create jobs and reduce the actual number of unemployed, but to reduce the figures. The amendment does that by releasing on to the labour market people who have a contribution to make and are working in a real job, whereas the current rules are a disincentive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same anomaly operates under family credit and housing benefit schemes. In a moment we shall discuss amendment No. 150, which would change the rules for income support only. Had it been more widely drafted, it would have stood little chance of being selected for this debate or the later one on clause 11. However, if
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
the principle is accepted, it should be applied to all three means tested benefits. That would pose no difficulty as it would require a change only in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ideally, we should like the rules to be changed so that all work expenses—not only child care costs—could be deducted from earnings. That would be defensible not only for lone parents but for all claimants. The case for allowing child care costs, however, is particularly strong as it is mainly lone parents who are affected by not deducting that form of work expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lone parenthood and poverty continue to go hand in hand. It is estimated that 73 per cent of the countries 1 million lone parents qualify under the three income-related benefits schemes, and 91 per cent of lone parents are women. They are unable to be on low pay and be discriminated against in other ways under the present system, which does not recognise the child care costs that are inevitably incurred when they work. The majority find themselves, often to their surprise, to be financially worse off when they take unemployment. It is an astonishing fact that work is an expensive luxury to many of those people—a luxury that they cannot afford.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Child care costs greatly exceed the sum of £15 a week. Many lone parents imagine when they take up jobs that their financial position will improve. They rapidly find out the truth, give up their jobs and return to a subsistence level of income. Remarkably, the subsistence level without work is often higher than the subsistence level with work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For lone parents, the poverty trap is still enshrined in the family credit system. More than 42 per cent, of family credit claimants are lone parents. On family credit it is possible—on Government figures—for a woman with two children with child care costs of £50 a week who earns £100 to have her net weekly spending power reduced to £42.82—precisely £24.67 below income support level. The more she earns, the greater the disparity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some calculation have been prepared to illustrate that surprising fact. A lone parent with two children aged six and three years would receive, if she were not working, £40 income support, £14.50 child benefit, the one-parent benefit of £5.20, housing costs of £27 met by the state and £3 met by herself. She would have a net weekly spending power of £65.80 and the cost to the state would be £95.80. If she worked and had a weekly gross of £100, under the existing system her spending power would be reduced from £65 to £47.57. There would be a considerable saving to the state. If the child care costs were taken into account, her spending power would be increased to £85.28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another example of someone who is working and earning £155 shows that the difference between a net income of £100 and one of £155 means that the income increases only from £47 to £56, which is hardly a worthwhile sum for her to gain. Under the amendment, her net weekly spending power would increase from £56 to £95.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present system, a lone parent on £100 or
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
£150 a week would be considerably worse off than if she did not work and stayed on income support. If child costs were taken into account, earning £100 a week she would be £19.48 better off than on income support and the state would be £32.58 better off. If child care costs were taken into account for someone earning £150 a week, she would be £29.57 better off than on income support and the state would be £78.93 better off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are encouraged by the Secretary of State's words to a recent Select Committee on Social Services when he was interrogated on the subject. I am always a little encouraged; we appreciate the crumbs. He implied that he was thinking about it. We are not certain whether it is on the fast track, the hard shoulder or whether it is still in the garage and the Government will get it out next week. He was asked:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Talking of behavioural impact, and coming back to the theme of independence with which you opened, Secretary of State, do you recognise that the £15 limit on work related expenses, as compared with the previous position of supplementary benefit, is a disincentive, in your language, or certainly a cost experienced by single parent families seeking work? If so, why have it?"</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are, perfectly fairly, two issues that you are looking at when looking at disregards. The extent that you are trying to encourage people back into a work situation … then, of course, you would like to have a degree of disregard. There is a cost attached to it. There is a cost associated with anything you do in this area, and you have to judge as to the overall position. I think there are interesting areas here, especially with regard to low income families, and I have been discussing this in connection with certain single parent families and will certainly be pursuing it further.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman support me in my contention that women who go out to work should be allowed to offset against tax the cost of any help they need to do that, particularly childminding or creche fees or even domestic help? Does he think that would be a good idea?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member will deal with that intervention only in respect of its relevance to these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You leave me speechless, Mr. Winterton and I am shocked to learn that the hon. Lady seeks my support on anything. She mentioned a number of issues. While I appreciate the point that she makes, people whom we are discussing are not great taxpayers. We are looking at people in very low pay. Perhaps we can discuss this at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that Conservative Members stopped tax relief for those who paid costs for workplace nurseries and childminding and who have therefore put a tax on working parents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend is more daring than I, Mr. Winterton, in challenging your ruling about relevance to the amendment. I am grateful to him for that. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, South (Mr. Smith) was encouraged by the interest shown by the Secretary of State at the Select Committee meeting. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Are you saying that you are intending to review this to see the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0383">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>653</span>
effects, to consider possibly meeting child care costs in order to make it possible for those single parents who want to work to go out and get those jobs."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will not be quite so forthcoming every time I pursue it. I am saying I think there is a fair balanced debate on this point. It is something I am looking at very seriously because I am very conscious of the problems of those parents in a market where nobody would seek to force them to work, where many would wish to be in work and the opportunities of the workplace."</p></blockquote>
This matter has been discussed and is well understood by the Minister as can be seen from his agreeable nods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall press the amendment and its twin, No. 150 which relates to housing benefit. It would provide for child care costs to be allowed as a deduction from the earnings of single parents in calculating housing benefit, just as amendment No. 130 does for income support. Ideally we should like to present the third amendment on this, which makes a similar provision for child care costs in the calculation of family credit. The Bill does not include a clause on family credit but if
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
the principle is accepted—I see that the Minister i; eager to rise to do just that—it can be applied to famil} credit by simply amending the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the amendment for a single parent wit! net earnings over £15 a week would be to add the whole of the child care costs to the amount of income suppon payable. The effect of amendment No. 150 for a single parent not entitled to income support would be tc increase housing benefit entitlement by up to 85 pei cent of child care costs. If a similar amendment were made to the family credit rules, it would increase the combined amount of housing benefit and family credii by up to 95.5 per cent of the child care costs. It wouk make work very worth while for many lone parent! who at present gain little or nothing from taking a job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
