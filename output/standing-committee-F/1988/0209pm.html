	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [This day]:</i> No. 97, in page 6, line 3, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(bb) 'Employment' in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) does not include employment at an hourly rate of pay that is less than the Council of Europe's decency threshold.".—	<i>[Ms Short.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are discussing the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 98, in page 6, line 3, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(bb) 'Employment' in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) does not include employment at a rate of remuneration lower, or on conditions less favourable, than those generally observed in that district by agreement between associations of employers and of employees or failing any such agreement, than those generally recognised in that district by good employers.".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 100, in page 6, line 32, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) to seek or accept employment at a rate of remuneration such that his net income, after deducting any work-related expenses, would fall as a result of accepting such employment."</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle (Leeds,	<div class='memberconstituency'> West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we broke for lunch, I was arguing that the Government should accept the Council of Europe's decency threshold as a basis for a statutory minimum wage policy, so that we know what level of pay people should not be asked to accept. Without that bottom limit, it is plain that the Bill will mean that employers can offer extremely low wages and that people will have to accept them or their social security will be cut off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about the average wage as if everything depended on that. The average wage is £254 a week. By holding on to the average, the Government intend to create the impression that those at the top are held in close relation to those at the bottom, and have not come too far adrift from those at the bottom. I wish to emphasise the fact that those at the top are moving further ahead. The evidence exists in recent press articles, such as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Burton chief regains title of highest paid executive."</p></blockquote>
I need not rehearse the list of highest paid directors—we are well used to it. The people at the top of the league table are moving ahead, but not the people at the bottom of the league table—the deciles of earnings well below the average wage and even below half the average wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, the Minister implied that because the economy is doing well and the average figure has
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
increased, everyone's earnings must move up with that average. If the Minister checks with the Department of Employment he will find out that that is not the case. Some wages are held level with no increases for inflation, which means that in real terms, they are reduced. Some wages are actually reduced in cash terms. I refer the Minister to an article in the Industrial Relations Review and Report on 29 January, entitled "Low Pay Increases in the Deregulated Bus Sector". It reported that the majority of pay settlements were at the lower end of the 3 per cent. to 8 per cent. range. In some instances, new employees were taken on at lower rates than existing employees for the same work. In other words, wage rates were being cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Low Pay Unit's "The Poor Decade, Wage Inequalities in the 1980s" published in January 1988, spelt out that while the average earnings of the highest paid fifth of male workers have increased by 140 per cent. since 1979, the average earnings of the lowest paid fifth increased by only 98 per cent. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the first time since the 1930s we are witnessing actual cuts in the average earnings of the poorest workers in such sectors as hotels and catering and footwear."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) told us earlier that he worked in the hotel industry in his youth. Wage rates in the hotel industry are falling. People probably earn less now relatively in that industry than the hon. Gentleman did when he worked in it. The report refers to the poorest fifth of male workers in licensed non-residential establishments such as snack bars, cafes and those selling fast food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that Lord Young said that Britain's economy was doing well and that it was useless for the Opposition to claim that we should return to manufacturing industry because the key to economic growth was the service sector. He remarked that Britain's unemployment would be totally eliminated if more people were prepared to eat out. Obviously, Lord Young was passionately committed to the sector of snack bars, cafes and fast food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sector in which the wages of people in part-time or temporary work are not rising with average wage rates, but are falling. The poorest fifth of male workers in licensed non-residential establishments earned on average £1.50 a week less in April 1987 than in April 1986.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the Minister believe that the whole block of earnings is rising when some people's earnings are falling? There is a fracture in the economic league of the earnings table, which means that people in the bottom bands are doing significantly less well and becoming increasingly poorer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report from the Low Pay Unit said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The increase in the numbers of low paid appears to contradict ministerial assertions that economic growth is bringing with it improved living standards for the population as a whole. The reality is that rewards are becoming increasingly unequally divided."</p></blockquote>
That is still the case today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of our amendment is to urge the Minister to accept the principle of a statutory
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0257">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
minimum wage. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) has campaigned for some years for such legislation, and other Opposition Members have presented private Member's Bills to that end. I presented such a Bill last year. I would not have plucked a figure out of the air, but suggested that, as the Government are so keen to promote 1992 as the year of the great Common Market, we should take on board the social provisions of that Common Market. They include the definition of a decency threshold of two thirds—66.8 per cent.— of the average wage as a figure below which people should not be expected to receive remuneration. That would enable people at the lowest end of the wages scale to be anchored to the average wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point made by the hon. Member for Stockport may have been in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a long time since I did O-level mathematics, but I calculate that if people are brought above a two-thirds level, everybody must move up and a third will always remain below. Does the hon. Gentleman not understand the logic of that simple mathematical formula?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was waiting for that point. I am always glad to receive mathematical lectures from Conservative Members. However, it may not have occurred to the hon. Gentleman that the top wages will cause the average wage to decline if the economy is not doing well. If the lowest wages are anchored to the average wage, that may limit the rate at which the highest wages rise. The average wage is pulled up to £254 a week not because my constituents' wages are increasing but because top wage earners receive rewards inordinately in excess of the average.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall (Hendon, South)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the top salary earners are often the most internationally mobile and may contribute significantly to the United Kingdom? Does he wish to encourage them to leave these shores?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have heard Conservative Members rehearse those arguments before. You will rule me out of order, Mr. Winterton, if I say that even the Government's tax reductions have not stopped the exodus of our highest trained professionals, who leave to go to America. The hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) could hardly say that they are priced out by the economy because they pay too much tax, or that international mobility has made things easier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall oblige the hon. Gentleman if he proceeds down that line of argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was merely trying to respond to the intervention, which widened the scope of the debate. The hon. Member for Hendon, South needs to reflect on his remarks in the light of what the hon. Member
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
for Stockport said earlier, about people who take low-paid jobs, in response to the contribution of my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). People who take low-paid jobs often take them through necessity and not necessarily because they want to do them or because they are in tune with their skills and, as my hon. Friend suggested, there might be a deskilling. Let us not suggest to those people that they make less of a contribution to Britain and the economy than those at the top, which seems to be the justification for giving tax cuts to the very rich. The carrot method is used for the rich, but for the people at the bottom, the classic method of beating them with a stick and penalising them for their poverty is used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to say why he is not prepared to go along with the former leader of the Conservative party and former Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. He was the one who suggested that we would need a statutory minimum wage in Britain—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hear Conservative Members decrying their leader. I wonder whether they would like to stand up and intervene and say that they now profoundly disagree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which party was Winston Churchill in when he said that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be surprised to know that Winston Churchill introduced the wages councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that Winston Churchill is the only major politician in the 20th century who has ratted and re-ratted, so he had quite a chequered political career.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I say to the hon. Gentleman before he responds that he may do so as long as his response is relevant to the amendment that we are debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: After Winston Churchill proposed the wages councils, I do not recollect any Conservative Government—and Conservatives have been in Government within the past 80 years—except this one proposing to repeal them. The Government are ratting on that promise to establish a basic minimum wage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman it talking nonsense. This Government have yet to decide to repeal the wages councils, so I ask the hon. Gentleman not to put words into their mouths. I hope that they will decide that, but they do not have a policy of repealing the wages councils.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to bring some rationale to the current debate, I advise the Committee that I have two portraits of Winston Churchill in my office and I view with deep concern criticism of that distinguished national leader.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stood up on this occasion to praise Winston Churchill and I am prepared to say that I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0258">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
praise the policies of the man, and just because he changed party, I do not necessarily disagree with the policies. I do not mind quoting what he said in 1909. Conservative Members may want to disagree with it, and the hon. Member for Dorset, South said that he thought that I was talking nonsense. It may not have occurred to him that the Government passed legislation in 1986 which dismantled some of the wages councils. Now, a consultation document suggests finishing them off altogether. If the hon. Gentleman is not aware of that, I suggest that he goes and finds out what is happening before he intervenes again in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the words of Winston Churchill. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is a serious national evil that any class of His Majesty's subjects should receive less than a living wage for their utmost exertions. It was formerly supposed that the working of the laws of supply and demand would naturally regulate or eliminate that evil … But where you have no organisation, no parity of bargaining, the good employer is undercut by the bad, and the bad is undercut by the worst … where these conditions prevail you have not a condition of progress, but a condition of progressive degeneration."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 28 April 1909; Vol. 4, c. 388.]</p></blockquote>
Those words are as relevant as they were in 1909. It is all very well for Ministers to say that we concentrate on the worst cases when they are legislating to get the best from employers. As Winston Churchill said, we must anticipate the worst. Bad employers will undercut the better ones and will themselves be undercut by even worse employers. Our amendment does not insert a figure as Conservative Members suggest. It anchors those at the bottom bracket of the wage scale into the average wage so that they do not drift far from those at the top end of the wage scale, who pull that average up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservatives are not ready to go back to Winston Churchill and support the statutory minimum wage. In Europe it is called—I assume that this is deliberate—the decency threshold. The suggestion is that there is an indecency in expecting people to accept wages that are not adequate remuneration for their work, and that do not recognise their participation as human beings and citizens of our society. It is also indecent to have an indirect subsidy to employeers through the family credit system, which enables them to cut their wage rates. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain why, when I table parliamentary questions to find out the Government's view on the Council of Europe's decency threshold, I am told that they do not even acknowledge it. Do they not accept the Council of Europe when there is so much talk of 1992? I hope that the Minister, as on an earlier occasion, will surprise us and accept the amendment and go some way to establish the conditions of progress to which Winston Churchill referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the descent into irrationality to which you drew attention, Mr. Winterton was the result of Conservative Members breaking their vow of silence. I hope that my remarks will not lead to a similar deterioration in the quality of debate. I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
silence will prevail. I was contemplating how much more productive the efforts of the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr Favell) were in his previous occupation many years ago than on this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have seen many incredible proposals from the Government but we did not expect to see an idea that most of us thought belonged to the past. In the early part of the century, after the cruelties of the 19th century, an understanding on labour relations began to emerge. It was accepted by all parties and by people of all walks of life. It is extraordinary to hear someone who was regarded in my part of the world as an extremist for events that took place at Tonypandy being compared to a rodent by Conservatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rat and rat again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ratted was the word used but only rats behave as rats. That illustrates the extrordinary change that has taken place in politics. The Church of England, the House of Lords and members of the Royal family are now regarded as being on the extreme Left and are challenging many of the things that this Thatcherite Government are doing. The Conservative party has moved so far to the Right that when, in a previous debate, I quoted Winston Churchill and the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath), there were shouts from the Government Benches of "closet Socialists". That is the extent to which the Government have moved towards political extremism and the loony Right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We heard about the mobility of labour. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) mentioned 1992. What will happen when people are needed for the grape harvest in Portugal? Where will the Portuguese look for coolies to work for half a dozen pesetas and a glass of wine a day? They will come here. Under threat of penalties, I assume that in 1992, when the great moment dawns, we shall have an army of workers to be sent to the less progressive parts of the EEC. I take that back—there are now no EEC countries which are less progressive than us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been reading about the Minister in "Parliamentary Profiles" and I tremble for his future, because he is pro-EEC. He must find the way that we have fallen behind the rest of the EEC extremely alarming. We are reverting to a cruel past. We have been left behind in terms of all the civilising reforms that have taken place throughout Europe, especially in the past 20 years. We are moving backward, and other European countries are moving forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government abolish the wages councils, which looks very likely, Britain will be the only EEC country without any minimum wage regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point later. There are so many parts of our legislation—this is one example, but there are others, especially in social legislation—where Britain is the backward man or woman of Europe. The progressive forces are in Europe now. That would have been hard to believe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0259">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>425</span>
10 or 20 years ago when we saw Europe as a kind of rich man's club. E. P. Thompson described it vividly as a crowd of middle-aged couples gathering together in a seedy hotel in Brussels for a group grope—whatever that means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us come to the Minister's point about the errant average. That is a favourite expression to use when someone wants to lie with statistics. Generally, anyone using an average in this case is attempting to deceive. We hear that expression all the time; it is put in every Government statement on pensions. We have to divide the statistics into deciles. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West says, if we are satisfied with an average figure, it encourages the Government to load more money on to the top end and take it away from the bottom, because the average still favours their point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The truth of the shift that has taken place over the past 10 years is that 9.9 million adults working in Britain are now paid below the European decency threshold. The Government may say that there is always some group in that position, but the number of people in that category has increased by 2 million since 1979. Pay rises for the highest paid one fifth of men in the work force have been 50 per cent. greater than pay rises for the lowest paid one fifth. The poorest paid one fifth of male manual workers now earns less, relatively, than the average since 1886, when the figures were first collected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a society divided unfairly by wages; this is the worst that it has been—certainly since 1886. There has been no other period since then when the gulf between the rich and poor, which has accelerated during the past few years, has widened so greatly and so quickly. Matters have not improved since that famous occasion when we were all touched by the resignation from the Government by Lord Gowrie, who confessed to a sympathetic public that he could not live on £33,000 a year, indeed that no one could live on such a salary in London. I know that it made a big impression in my constituency, in a pre-election period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has been made that wages have risen at a huge rate for those at the top. Let us consider the changes in benefits. The Government have got away with this great illusion that they are the tax cutters and that they have improved matters. However, they have cut those taxes that are most visible. Those of which we are not so conscious or which are not so obvious, such as VAT and national insurance, have gone up. There is a striking illustration of this in the publication "Changing tax: how the system works and how to change it", which I commend to Conservative Members. It gives an example of a typical family, with one breadwinner and a spouse at home looking after two children, and discusses what that represents. The Government constantly quote such an arrangement as the average, but only 7 per cent. of the population live like that, so the so-called average is a very unrepresentative indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average earnings, defined by the Treasury, of £11,700 a year are artificially boosted by the high salaries of the few. Seventy per cent. of all full-time
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
employees earn less than that. The book publishes a fascinating histogram of the groups involved which should be commended to us all. It shows the effect of direct tax and benefit changes since 1978–79 on the average net gain by income groups. These are by decile groups.

Yesterday in my constituency the stone for the Patent Office was laid. You will remember, Mr. Winterton, that almost the only opposition to it came from Macclesfield, of all places. Your name was mentioned with some honour yesterday within the constituency of Newport, West.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are happy to take average deciles. However, this striking picture shows the average effect of those changes. Those at the top, the best-off tenth of society, are better off—direct tax changes have benefited them to the extent of 30-odd per cent. All the other groups, except the final three, have lost, and lost by large amounts—10, 12 or 14 per cent. These changes have occurred in benefits, tax and wages, and have resulted in this enormous change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) will not respond to that comment, which is irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I understand your desire to keep the Committee in order, but we now see a pattern of interventions that must be out of order. You command Opposition Members not to respond to the interventions. That gives an unbalanced record of the Committee. If an intervention is out of order, it should be stopped. If it is allowed to be made, it should be briefly answered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I do not know the content and detail of an intervention until it has been made.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our concern about the clause if unamended is that it would be a charter for unscrupulous employers who will take the lead that they get from the Bill to create a spiral of wage undercutting, reduced inefficiency and great hardship.

We are becoming the sweatshop of Europe—the worst employer in Europe. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity."</p></blockquote>
The European Social Charter provides for people the right to receive:
	<br><blockquote><p>"fair remuneration sufficient for a decent standard of living."</p></blockquote>
The treaty of the organisation so beloved of the Minister—the European Community—states that one of its aims is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to promote improve working conditions and an improved standard of living for workers."</p></blockquote>
We have seen a deplorable deterioration in all work standards including those on safety and remuneration, and in the status of employed people. Their bargaining power has been taken away or weakened by attacks on the trade union movement. Individual workers have to fend for themselves, rather than argue from the strength of organisations working for them. Even the Confederation of British Industry is opposed to the threat to the wages council. Its submission on them talked about wage undercutting and inefficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) may have spoken with the authentic voice of the Government in a debate two years ago in this House. He said that although people do not want to return to Victorian sweatshops, that he would prefer it if the country was one sweatshop, hard at work instead of having 3 million unemployed. Is that the Government's view? Are we creating a society in which there is wide-scale exploitation of labour?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the mistaken beliefs behind the Bill is that the wage expectations of the unemployed are somehow out of line with reality and that they have an excessive view of what they should achieve. In a pub in my constituency the barmaid wears a badge that says, "When all else fails, lower your standards." The Government talk about widening horizons, but that means lowering standards. Sadly, unemployed people become rapidly demoralised, so they lower their standards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the problem with lowering standards in this case that, if the wages councils go, there is no floor to which those standards will fall? They will continue to fall, and wage rates will go down and down. No matter how low the wage people are offered, they will still be denied benefit if they refuse the work. That is the problem of not having a threshold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right, and we await a response from the Minister on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do unemployed people have inflated expectations about what they should earn? The Government research on the atypical London labour market said that the average minimum take home pay that claimants would accept was £118 a week. Over 20 per cent. would accept less than £100 a week, and another 40 per cent. sought less than £150 a week. The report concludes that the broad comparisons that are possible show that the unemployed people's expectations of take home pay overlap to a large extent with the wages paid by London employers to recent recruits. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that many long-term unemployed people have realistic wage expectations. That knocks aside the basis of the clause and suggests that our amendment should be accepted. That has been borne out by other studies too. Perhaps the Minister will quote studies that refute that. The Policy Studies Institute, hardly a nest of Marxists, shows that the majority of unemployed men tend to come from low-paid jobs and have expectations of similar low pay which are therefore realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the floor be? Rigidities were mentioned. Rigidities mean the right of workers to claim a wage and decent conditions and stand up for themselves. The opposite of the rigidities in the market would be total flexibility. An economy in which the employees are totally flexible to the demands of the employers would be based slavery. Is there a bottom to that? I have a case in my constituency of a waiter who earns less than £1 an hour and has to travel a long distance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The supreme cause for not accepting a job is the wages. In a case in South Wales, a man's hours had been reduced to such an extent that his earnings, less travel expenses, did not leave him enough to pay his parents for his keep. He resigned his job and was disqualified from benefit. On appeal that disqualification was withdrawn. I presume that under this clause it would not have been withdrawn and would have been justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The origin of the clause is the Government's irritation at the high proportion of cases where benefit was stopped but reinstated on appeal. The Bill will make sure that such cases are no longer won on appeal. The Minister objected to the words of the chief adjudicator on the act of reseeking work. The purpose of the clause is to change such decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our experience of employers is different from the strange people whom the Government have in mind. Many employers are thoroughly unscrupulous and behave badly towards their employees. Another case of benefit being taken away concerns a person who left a job which paid £80 for a 70-hour week. A third case involves a young married man with three children. He got a job in a supermarket at basic wages council rates and then found that he was expected to work up to 10 hours weekly overtime for no extra pay. He was disqualified from unemployment benefit when he gave up the job. We should like a clear statement from the

	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
Minister about what floor will exist. Do people have to work for nothing? That is implied here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred earlier to Wales. The thinking behind the Bill and the report that was quoted are both very London-oriented. We should consider the situation in other parts of the country. I shall concentrate on Wales, as it is typical of many regions. The Minister seems to have swallowed, hook, line and sinker, the myth of the regeneration of Wales. The Secretary of State for Wales is very energetic and spends his time trying to stir up manic optimism. He has an extraordinary vocabulary. One of his few real achievements has been to produce more press releases than any other Secretary of State before him. He issued 904 press releases—double the number that was issued a couple of years ago. I analysed the language in the press releases, and found that the adjectives used most frequently were, "colossal", "fabulous", "tremendous" and "staggering". At least one of those words appeared in every press release, and in some all four appeared. The press releases usually described the most mundane events. I published the result of my analysis, and I did not hear the Secretary of State use the word "staggering" again until yesterday. He was obviously having trouble with his equilibrium again. He then went on to use the words "vibrant", "lively" and "vigorous". It is now back to the adjective mine to find some new words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State for Wales has been very astute and has seduced the press, who believe his incurable incontinence of hyperbole. He cannot be matched. The person who writes the sketch article in 	<i>The Guardian</i> wrote about Welsh Questions one day—a rare treat. He spoke of the archaic language used by Conservative Members, and how they were lost in the past. When it comes to using superlatives, the Secretary of State is stuck in the B movies of 20 years ago. It is not even good hyperbole. It was not Welsh Members of Parliament who were criticised in that respect, as is often the case, but the Secretary of State for Wales, who is lost in a time warp. It does not help, while he is attracting a great deal of attention to Wales, to have the Secretary of State ludicrously overstating the improvements that have taken place there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the efforts of someone not a hundred miles from Macclesfield, the Patent Office came to Newport yesterday. That is a marvellous development which will mean quality jobs, high skills and good wages, but the main source of jobs to come to Wales has been the Japanese factories, which are coming because of the low-wage economy. The Cardiff business school report gave one celebrated firm's description of the work force that it required. It wanted only nice girls employed—in other words, no fat ones. Another Japanese factory got rid of its female staff when they reached 35. Even worse than that, although the imported technology in such factories is allegedly high-tech, it is 20 years out of date. One factory in Wales employs 250 people, while its sister factory in Japan employs 15. The output of the Japanese factory is double the output of the Welsh factory, where the technology is already out of date. The Japanese factory has up-to-date technology, but
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
the out-of-date technology can be put in the Welsh factory because of our low wages and because we are part of the EEC. There is a grave difference between the fragile employment coming to Wales and real jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Less than a year ago, the Cardiff business school said that it was still too early to consider that the recent events in Wales represent a turning point and a shift towards a basically stronger economy. It still felt that the fundamental weaknesses remained: employment in Wales has declined significantly since 1979 and the performance of the Welsh economy in this respect is poorer than any other region. People must stop listening to the hyperbole and look at the reality of life in Wales, which is one of low pay. The situation can only get worse if the Bill is enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The take-home pay of many thousands of workers in Wales is less than, or only just above, the poverty line, and it is far worse than that in any other region in Britain. In 1986, the Welsh Inter Censal Survey showed the high level of household deprivation throughout Wales. Over 42 per cent. of households in Wales had an income below £80 per week and in certain areas the survey revealed extreme levels of deprivation: in Rhuddlan, Dinefwr, Blaenau Gwent, Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda over half of all households had incomes below £80 per week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Am I corrent to assume that the hon. Gentleman is seeking to link his argument with the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I was coming to the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Cynon Valley, the proportion exceeded 60 per cent., making it the most deprived area in Britain and one of the most deprived areas in Europe.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in what my hon. Friend has said. Did he say that 80 per cent. of people in Wales earned less than £80 a week? I ask that because we are arguing for a decency threshold—a bottom line. The hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce), who is not here now, referred to the wages councils and the consultation document. If the Minister is shocked by those figures, he may be interested to know that the consultation document refers to the minimum rate of pay for adult workers, and expresses with some surprise the fact that wages range from as low as £1.96 an hour. If the hon. Member for Dorset, South were here he would correct my arithmetic, but that works out at £76.04 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will my hon. Friend confirm that 80 per cent. of people in Wales earn less than what the Government see as an appallingly low income?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Perhaps I should apologise to the Committee, as when I last spoke about Pontypridd, I gave some information that is now inaccurate. I said that there were two Conservative candidates; there is now only one, as the other has joined the Labour party and is working as an extra voter for Kim Howells. Mr.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As ever, my hon. Friend is giving the Committee valuable information.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to tell the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. If the candidates concerned were making statements about the low wage threshold and the free enterprise economy in Wales, I am sure that you would agree that that would be in order as it would be pertinent to this Committee. We would get a direct feedback about our discussions from the people of Pontypridd.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The candidates concerned would have to make such statements quickly to be quoted on this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of balance, I should say that the Secretary of State for Wales has had a profound effect on the balance of support for parties in Wales. The Labour party is now eight points higher in the only national poll that has been conducted since Peter Walker came to power. The only notable election result since then was in my constituency of Newport, West, where the Labour party gained four seats. That was a remarkable achievement, as we had almost every seat already. We must pay tribute to Peter Walker as he has contributed to a drop in Tory support and a vast increase in Labour support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should address the Secretary of State for Wales by his constituency and not by his name.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not mention him again. The Minister has told us how he thinks employers behave. Several comments made about earlier amendments are germane to this one. We must consider what a good, normal employer will be likely to do when faced with this clause unamended. I shall quote from someone who feels himself to be a good employer, who described in detail part of his life history in a recent debate on low pay on the Floor of the House. It would be interesting to reflect on what he would have done and how he would be affected by such a clause. I am talking about the hon. Member for Dorest, South, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When I first opened my employment agency in that town, I had to pay my staff unacceptably low rates of pay; to be competitive".</p></blockquote>
I shall be fair to him as always, and read the rest of the sentence
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I had to go against others in the same town, though I was able to pay my staff perhaps 10p an hour more than my rivals down the road. By slashing my margins and being efficient and working hard, I was able to put these people out into the market place at approximately the same rates that employers were paying previously. I was successful in putting my rivals out of business."</p></blockquote>
It is the authentic voice of homo Thatcheris. I sometimes have a fear that we have put evolution into reverse from the peak of homo sapios—the thinking, reasoning man who stood upright—through Cro-Magnon man, back to neanderthal man, who was a crouching, hairy, grunting man. Now we have homo Thatcheris, the man that sees competition as the supreme and only virtue—competition red in tooth and claw. That is the only god, the supreme virtue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sometimes when we are in the Chamber, one half closes one's eyes and sees the group facing us. There are frightening moments when the Chamber is full, we hear these grunting and braying noises from Conservative Members and see these creatures who are stunted, misshapen or elongated. One can almost believe that the process of evolution has been reversed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One must admire the Member for Dorset, South, who spoke frankly about a subject to which he clearly warms. He described someone about whom he has a great and abiding admiration. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if there was a wages council for executive or secretarial recruitment staff, possibly these would have been illegally low 	<i>wages".—[Official Report,</i> 1 February 1989; Vol 146, c.375–6.]</p></blockquote>
He found that there were women graduates who had no choice, and had no other option than to be pushed into secretarial jobs, but who were interested in achieving more executive role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The story builds up, not to the climax that we would have expected, to which the hon. Gentleman was leading when we heard the story. It does not quite reach to how he jumped on a cloud and ascended into heaven, although it reaches to Parliament. He goes on to explain how, having put all the other firms out of business, he was then able to pay his staff substantially larger amounts of money. I think that he mentioned double the going rate. He quotes that as an example of how unleashed and unfettered competition would result in better terms for the workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, after underpaying and exploiting his workers over that long period, the resulting holy grail the hon. Gentleman had to offer was that of reasonably higher wages. What happens next is that homo Thatcheris No. 2 comes along and says, "I read it in 	<i>Hansard,</i> I now know how to do it." He then moves into Huddersfield, and says that the way to get on in business is to employ some more people, pay them dirt wages, and then undercut the successor companies to that set up by the hon. Member for Dorset, South. So it goes on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great game, which is very satisfying for the entrepreneurs who make a great deal of money out of it, is being played at the expense of the workers who are defenceless and whose wages are continually cut. It is an auction to see who can pay the poorest rate. We shall see what happened in that instance a thousand times over. The clause is a charter for wage cutting, driving down wages and exploiting people in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0263">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
a way that has not been seen in our generation. It is a step back to a cruel past that should have been buried by all decent-thinking people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we are agreed that the amendments aim to ensure that we limit the range of employment opportunities that people are expected to pursue by three separate devices, which are built round the wages limits or definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall respond to the penultimate peroration of the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). Iain MacLeod was mentioned earlier and I remember him saying at a Conservative party conference that competition was only the partner and basis for compassion. One cannot deliver compassion unless one creates the resources to deliver it or, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) said, it is a fat lot of good promising the earth and delivering the International Monetary Fund. That was the experience of the Labour Government—that was why real living standards fell in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977 and only when they started trying to manufacture a pre-election boom and ended up with the winter of discontent did living standards begin to rise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister examine a little more closely the figures that he quoted—I see a great tome in front of him—and the effects on the lowest paid during 1974 and 1975 of the rent freeze, price freezes, the support for certain food industries to keep prices down and a considerable increase in the wages that the very low paid received at that time? Was it not a period of welcome redistribution that the poorest people in this country had not experienced for a long time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend the hon. Gentleman to page 85 of the latest "Social Trends" so that he can see what happened in those circumstances. All the attempts to freeze prices and wages ended in tears because it was impossible for a bureaucracy to manage that sort of system and to resist the efforts of the so-called allies of the Labour Government—the trade union movement—to bust their efforts at wage control.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Burns	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend remember that in August 1975 the lowest paid were the hardest hit when the annual rate of inflation rose to 25.9 per cent. and during the whole period of that Labour Government, prices doubled for the first time in peace time since the reign of Queen Elizabeth I?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not the social fund brought us a winter of discontent? The Minister talks of economics; that was very good economics for my constituency, where the 38 per cent. unemployed lost over £2 million from the social fund because of the rules on grants and loans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would all question the basis of the hon. Gentleman's statistics, and I am not sure that the social fund is relevant to this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I presume that when the Minister said that competition is the partner of compassion, he was saying that that would be the view of the Tory Government—that through efficiency we can be compassionate. The record shows clearly that under his Government, the combined effect of tax and social security changes is that the top 10 per cent. have gained £40 a week and that has been paid for by a loss in the bottom 50 per cent. of £8.50 per week per family. There is not much compassion attached to the Government's policy of competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the Opposition's arguments and allegations about what has happened to the low paid in our society, but first I shall deal with amendment No. 97 and the Council of Europe's decency threshold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The national minimum wage is alleged to be the Council of Europe's concept, but as I shall explain, it is not, never has been and has no likelihood of becoming, a concept endorsed by the Council of Europe. A national minimum wage, irrespective of any effect on costs, is bound to destroy jobs in the long run. It means lost employment opportunities and introducing a rigidity into the structure of wages that is bound to remove jobs for people who do not have to maintain a family or household. Some individuals may be in the business of taking jobs at wages below those which needed to support an individual and his family independently in their own home. A national minimum wage would do nothing other than destroy job opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, establishing a national minimum would totally disturb the differentials between wages at the lower end, create a wage spiral and a return to the inflationary pressures that characterised the whole period of office of the Labour Government. Therefore, I am no fan of the concept of a national minimum wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am a fan of establishing the facts about low pay in Britain. Low pay cannot be equated with a low standard of living. Many people on low pay do not have family responsibilities, or the responsibility for meeting housing costs. Therefore, they can enjoy a higher standard of living than their wage would enable them to achieve if they had those other responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition should consider the figures for households on below average incomes and see the facts. They will find that only one in 10 of the bottom 10 per cent. of earners—those on £88 a week or below—live in the bottom 30 per cent. of households. Overall, seven out of 10 of the bottom 10 per cent. of earners live in the top 50 per cent. of households. Three quarters of the bottom 10 per cent. of female earners live in the top 50 per cent. of households. There is no equation between the level of wage and the standard of living of the household in which that wage earner lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put the figure to the Minister earlier, but I should like him to endorse it. Is it the case that 4.4 million of families living in poverty in Britain are headed by a wage earner on a low wage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We had all the talk about the vast numbers of people who are in the lowest deciles of earnings and wages. My simple point is that those figures cannot be equated with the percentage of people living in households in poverty. A different measurement must apply for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke about the spiral of inflation if there was a minimum wage, but we are saying that we want employers to take less.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may mean that some companies go out of business because they cannot afford to pay wages. All employers operate in the market place and they try to pay the wages that they can afford in competition with other employers in the area in which they operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give us the figures for households? I quoted household figures for the Cynon valley, where 60 per cent. of households have a total income of less than £80 a week. Is the Minister objecting to the way that the figures are presented? I am sure that there are low-paid people in prosperous houses. Will he give us the equivalent figures for low-paid households?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman looks at the tax benefit model tables on page 68, he will see how difficult it is for anyone, even a single person, on low pay to be worse off in work than on benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill will make it easier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not in the least. The hon. Gentleman should look at the present situation and see how it has been developing over recent years. In November 1985, some 60,000 families would have been better off on benefit than in work, but the figure is now 20,000, or 0.15 per cent. of all families in the country. The same is true of the figures of 90 per cent. and over, of 80 per cent. and over and of 70 per cent. and over. All these things are moving in the right direction and will continue to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given us half the figure and we are half-persuaded by it. Can he give us the connection between the level of benefit and the level of earnings over that period? We are suggesting that the level of benefits has fallen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The level of benefits has increased: benefits have at least maintained their level and most have increased as have earnings over that period.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the level of benefits has risen but not compared with the level of earnings. At best benefits have risen only in line with prices. The Minister talked about the tax benefit model tables and unfortunately I was too busy trying to find them to follow his precise points. However, I think that he
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
will confirm that a whole range of work expenses are excluded from those tables, which has the neat effect of making them both not comparable with the figures we had until this year and look cosmetically better than they actually are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, we get back to this argument about averages. The old figures included the average of work expenses at some £6 or so. Many people have no travel-to-work costs. Others have higher figures. These figures are relevant and paint a true picture.

I am sorry that the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) is not present. I find it incredible that he can sustain an argument that people are being offered £1 an hour to work part-time in bars in his constituency. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said that people were being offered a similar amount in the hotel and catering industry, which I find equally incredible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister finds it incredible if by that he means that he finds it difficult to reconcile it with his previous views on the subject. That is slightly different from challenging me to prove that that is the case. If he thinks that it is not true, perhaps my hon. Friend and I should invite him to come to see that it is. A woman on low pay rang a phone-in in Leeds to say that her son had been offered £1 an hour. She thought that he was lying to avoid giving her an appropriate amount for housekeeping. She rang the company concerned and asked whether they paid £1 an hour and was shocked when that was confirmed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did rather better and was more economical than visiting Birkenhead to find out the facts. We contacted the jobcentre there. It has 10 bar work vacancies of which nine are part time and they all pay at least £2.30 an hour. I do not claim for one moment that the hon. Member for Birkenhead would deliberately mislead the Committee—I know him much better than to do that—but he may be out of touch with the reality in his constituency. Those are the figures today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may make that point in the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead. A week last Monday I saw a job in the window of my jobcentre at £1.99 an hour and others at £2 an hour for job machinists in the textile industry who are skilled workers. That is a fact, and I invite the Minister to ring up the Bramley jobcentre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The magic figure of £1 an hour for which people were being invited to work was imported into the discussions this morning. The figures in Birkenhead are £2.30 an hour for the 10 bar jobs that are being advertised and at least £2 an hour in the hotel and catering industry. We all hear anecdotal stories and there is always a danger with them. I am sorry to respond to the hon. Member for Birkenhead in his absence, but this is my first chance to respond to the point that he made this morning. Those jobs are paying at least £2.30. I do not for one moment pretend that that is a princely sum, but it is certainly not £1 an hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me refresh the Minister's memory. My hon. Friend did not say that every bar job in Birkenhead was on offer for £1 an hour. He said that he knew of such jobs and had been told of bar work in Birkenhead that was paying that sum. Throughout our proceedings, the Minister has been telling us how many vacancies are not notified to jobcentres. It is likely that jobcentres are reluctant to advertise vacancies offering sums as low as that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those jobs are available today in the jobcentre at that rate. There may be other people offering jobs at a lower rate, but if the jobs are available at the jobcentre at more than double the £1 that the hon. Gentleman was talking about, most people in their right minds would take those jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even if jobs are available, as the Minister says, at £2 an hour—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: £2.30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, £2.30—does the Minister think that £2.30 an hour is a living wage for somebody who has to keep a family? Does he think that in this day and age it is on to pay somebody such disgracefully low wages? Is he saying that he approves of that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, of course I am not saying that. That is a point that I made earlier to the hon. Member for Leeds, West and to the Committee. The fact that a rate is being offered for a job does not mean that an individual has to bring up his family and maintain himself on that rate. There are in-work benefits available to people. Many of the people who earn lower levels are not in independent households bringing up families in any case. They are dependents of others living in households other than their own and that is why the idea of establishing a minimum wage is absolute nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is evading the issue. He is suggesting that someone who is working as a bar worker at £2.30 an hour may happen to be living or lodging in a household—perhaps as a tenant or paid guest—where the head of that household has a considerably larger income. That is of no benefit to the person who is employed as the bar worker. It is a completely fallacious argument to say that someone might be living in a house where the total household income is far greater than the average of £2.30 an hour. Such people are individuals earning £2.30 an hour. Does the Minister honestly think that £2.30 an hour is a fair and reasonable wage in this day and age for anybody to work at or live on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not the question that the hon. Gentleman addressed to me earlier, and he has now changed the whole basis of the question. He was then talking about a man living and bringing up his family on that wage. No, I do not think it would be enough, but wages are a matter to be established not by the state but by contracts between individuals and the employers who are offering the jobs and by the effects of the market place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is regrettable that my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) is not here. I understand that there was some Select Committee visit; perhaps the Chairman of our Committee might be able to confirm that. That is certainly why he left early this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible that the Minister has been misinformed by his telephone call. For some time, we have been trying to deal with the scandal of advertisement for jobs in jobcentres at illegal rates of pay under the wages councils' orders. Time and again low pay units in the west midlands and other areas have found that that is happening. When we show it up, the Government are embarrassed and say that they will stop it. I put it to the Minister seriously that if jobs were being advertised in the Birkenhead jobcentre at illegal rates of pay, his Department would not have been informed of them when the telephone call was made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Lady says is pure speculation. I gave the Committee absolute fact.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The distribution of gross hourly earnings is also worth considering—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not the sort of person to wish to leave unfinished business from our previous discussion. He says that a wage of £2.30 an hour is suitable for a single person without dependants but not for a family person with dependants. If that is his view, how will an adjudication officer decide whether it is reasonable for a person to receive a job with such wages?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was absent this morning when we discussed how the costs of travel to work and family circumstances influence an adjudication officer. I am not in the business of saying what is a reasonable wage, as it depends on an individual's circumstances and which part of the country he lives in. The wage that a person may need to maintain himself properly in London and the south-east may be different from the wage he will need in other parts of the country. Those factors must be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for intervening, but I quoted somebody in the same position. At a symposium in Newport three or four months ago, someone who works in a welfare agency spoke about a man who travels from Llanelli to Newport to work as a waiter for £48 a week. I am happy to give the name of the person who gave that information, as I have no doubt that that job exists. After travelling expenses the man is left with £1 an hour. If he had turned the job down, would he have been caught by the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that it would depend on the adjudication officer's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not even begun the main argument yet, as I was trying to dispel some of he myths that arose in our earlier discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister dispel one more? He says that he would not care to say what is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0266">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>439</span>
reasonable wage, and we sympathise with him about making that judgment. But during our discussions last week we were informed that, as a result of how the Government intend to change the law with respect to what can be judged to be the full extent of someone's normal work, an automatic bar would apply when someone reaches earnings that correspond to the lower earnings limit of about £41. As long as someone is earning that much, that will be assumed to be the full extent of his normal work. Unfortunately, I did not bring my calculator but I work it out to be not even £2.80 an hour.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what lesson the hon. Lady is seeking to draw from that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that he does not know what is an adequate wage. But, in the "full extent normal" context, he is prepared to rule that as long as someone is earning about £2.75 an hour, that can be considered to be the full extent of his normal work. If that does not mean that the Minister thinks that that is enough money to live on, I do not know what it means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the "full extent normal" rule is separate and distinct from the subject that we were discussing today.

The other myth that I should like to dispel is the assertion of the hon. Member for Leeds, West that wages in the hotel and catering industry have been falling in recent years. The January 1989 	<i>Employment Gazette</i> shows that over the five years from 1982 to 1987, earnings in the hotel and catering industry rose by 13.9 per cent. in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the main thrust of my argument about amendment No. 97. The Council of Europe, on which the amendment is allegedly based, has never set a decency threshold. Members who were in the House last Wednesday for the low pay debate will have heard my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Employment, the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Mr. Nicholls) make that point very clearly and explain that the so-called decency threshold which was suggested by a committee of independent experts has never been endorsed by any member of the Council of Europe, nor by the Council's governmental committee on the European social charter. It has no general acceptance. I should like to clear up any possible misunderstanding in relation to the speech of the hon. Member for Leeds, West by saying that the Council of Europe has nothing to do with the European Community or 1992. The idea put forward by the committee of experts has no general acceptance in the Council of Europe. As the idea has not been taken up, it has no relevance, so the amendment should fall on that basis if no other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 97 is about setting a national minimum wage. I have explained why I and my hon. Friends believe that that would be inflationary and lead not to greater employment opportunities, but to job losses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For clarification, although I am strongly in favour of having a national minimum wage—it
	<span class='label label-info column'>440</span>
would be more just and would make our economy more efficient—the amendment does not propose that. It would mean that people could not be forced to take a job that paid less than a certain amount, or lose their benefit it they did not take it. The amendment has a much more limited objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. I know that there is a difference between us on the national minimum wage, and we shall certainly not resolve that. On amendment No. 97, as there is no Council of Europe level of decency, we cannot incorporate that point in the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's patience in giving way to interventions. Let me put the point to him another way. If a minimum is set, it affects the level of wages in the industry concerned. I recall that in the Bramley jobcentre—I make no apology for referring to it, and the Minister can ring and check the figures—the minimum wages council figure in the textile industry is £1.99 an hour. Last Monday there was one job in the window at £1.99 an hour. Other jobs for machinists in the textile industry were offering £2 an hour—lp above the minimum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister believe that if there had not been a wages council level, those figures would have been precisely 1p over the wages council minimum, rather than being much higher, because it seems rather miraculous to me? The figure has been stuck for many years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I can answer that question. However, I remember that in the 1970s, when Governments of both political persuasions attempted to have prices and incomes policies, they sought at times to give priority to those on low pay and enhance their wages. Inevitably, those above that level used to bid for higher wages to preserve their differentials. These were all familiar arguments during the 1970s, but not everyone will remember them. We saw a spiral of inflationary wage claims which did no good to anyone, least of all those who thought that their standard of living had been enhanced on a long-term basis by their treatment under an incomes policy. I urge the Committee not to go down that road, because in the long run it does nobody any good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is interesting to use the statistics thrown around debating this level of decency, which suggests that anyone who earns less than two thirds of the average must be low paid, that definition is nonsense. Let us imagine that there are only two employees in the world. One earns £1,000—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a stupid example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me explain. Opposition Members cannot understand the logic of my argument unless I go through it stage by stage. One person earns £1,000 and the other earns £100. The average is therefore £550, and two thirds of that is £368.50. If the £100 is put up to £368.50, the average is then £684.25, two thirds of which is £458.45. The figure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must deal first with the intervention from the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn). I am grateful to him for seeking to aid the Chair. I hope that he will continue to that for the rest of our proceedings. I assure the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) that I know no such thing, and I have been in the House for 15 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I hesitate to appear to cast doubt on any of your observations, but having been a Government Whip, if that was not what the Government Whip was trying to do, I do not know why he is drawing his salary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I need add nothing to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue the line taken by my hon. Friend.

Amendment No. 98 would partly reinstate provisions in the existing legislation which enable the benefit claimant to refuse to consider any employment for which the rate of pay is not the so-called going rate. Earlier, we discussed rigidities in the present system and our desire to get away from them. That is why we want to delete the concept of the going rate from this part of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want employment opportunities to be followed up by a claimant who has had his permitted period following unemployment and has been able then to look for jobs at a certain rate of pay in his former occupation. He will then be expected to broaden his horizons. We do not expect him totally to transform his job search immediately after the end of the permitted period, but he should progressively do so. The concept of the going rate is an artificial object to his doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>442</span>
The amendment would re-impose or maintain that system. That would be a great mistake and is out of touch with the Government's efforts to encourage people to take account of the growing opportunities in jobs. We are seeing, increased opportunities monthly and I am sure that the Committee is pleased to see that. Sticking to the rigidity in the present legislation will not encourage claimants to recognise that there are opportunities beyond those that they may have thought of in the first place. It will not encourage people to get back into work and begin the process of familiarising themselves with work habits and then, no doubt, being able to improve their position by promotion or by moving to other jobs. We want to free the labour market—not re-erect barriers to re-employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's words are exactly the same as those which the Government have used to describe all the training programmes that people go on for buttons. Are the Government saying now that there is no difference between work and the training programmes for which people get paid a tenner or a fiver? The difference between training programmes and work is being blunted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The vast majority of jobs will pay vastly in excess of the allowances that people can get on training schemes. We want people to have as broad a perspective on job opportunities as possible because, as I have said many times before, if people are in employment, albeit at a lower rate and in a different sector from that in which they ultimately want to work, they are more likely to re-establish themselves than if they sit back and wait for the perfect job to come along out of the blue.

Amendment No. 100 proposes that claimants should not be expected to take work that results in their being worse off than on benefit. I illustrated earlier how difficult it would be for anyone to find themselves in that position. A minuscule number—0.15 per cent. of all families—would do so. Our aim is that when people ask the employment service for advice about vacancies and job opportunities, they will be told of the benefits they will be able to claim when they are in work and thus make a provisional detailed assessment of the amount of their potential entitlement. The employment service is increasing its capacity to give that advice to claimants so that they can be clear what their position will be. We are anxious to see family credit taken up as widely as possible and are therefore arranging for fast-stream applications from claimants to be considered.

Our research shows that nearly everybody is now better off in work than on benefits. We have removed the worst elements of the so-called "unemployment trap" by reducing the basic rate of taxation, by increasing tax allowances by 25 per cent. in real terms since 1979, and by restructuring national insurance contributions to make lower paid jobs more attractive to both employers and employees. We have altered the way in-work benefits are assessed so as to base
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>443</span>
calculation on net rather than gross income and we have improved benefits for people in work. Those steps are all designed to encourage people back into employment or into employment in the first place. The artificial rigidities and distinctions that are incorported in these three amendments make them impossible to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the Minister have to say about the recent survey in Coventry? It examined the Government's leaflets, "Better off in Work" and "Cash Help" which told people that they would be better off if they accepted low-paid jobs and claimed income support on top of that. The calculations were made on rents of £28 and £24, when the actual rents were £38, and mortgages were not taken into account. The survey found that most people were worse off by £2.30 or £1.37. The leaflets did not take free milk or free meals to children into consideration. Will the Minister withdraw the leaflets and do the calculations again?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The leaflets published by the Department of Employment on in-work benefits are first class. I am not familiar with the leaflets that have been circulated in Coventry. I am familiar with the various tables on tax benefit and the information in "Social Trends" and all the other legitimate information that is published. If the hon. Gentleman sends me the Coventry leaflets we shall certainly try to analyse them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a predictable response from the Minister, but it was also gravely disappointing. We pointed out earlier the inevitable result of all the new requirements to seek work actively on a weekly basis or be threatened with a weekly loss of benefit and the deletion of the requirement that job offers should be suitable: people will be harassed and forced to accept low-paid jobs, often temporary and often part time. The Minister defended that without any shame.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 97 would not introduce a national minimum wage. It would simply prevent people who administer our benefit system from using their powers to force people to accept very low-paid jobs. As the Minister said a number of things about the national minimum wage, I shall briefly to set the record straight. He said that a national minimum wage is impossible because it would lead to a loss of jobs. How come all the other countries in western Europe can manage it? Is there some incompetence in Britain that makes it impossible. America has one as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not familiar with the circumstances in every country in Europe. I know that the so-called national minimum wage in the Netherlands has not been raised since 1983.

details obviously vary but the minimum wage exists in every other European country. Some have uprated it more than others. France went for a big uprating not so many years ago. Every other country manages to have minimum wage regulations, yet the Minister tells us that would lead to a loss of jobs in Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another argument. A study has been carried out by Cambridge Econometrics analysing our economy sector by sector, particularly the sectors where there is a lot of low pay. It suggests that where a minimum wage is brought in and properly planned and organised it leads to an increase in efficiency. Let us take the example of the textiles industry, which has been in severe decline for many years. An attempt was made to save jobs by cutting wages and it failed. The only answer to those declining, low-paying industries is restructuring, investment, training and improving wage levels. There is clear and detailed evidence that a minimum wage is possible and is better for people. It is more just. There is less inequality and it improves economic efficiency. The Government's economic strategy of competition through wage cutting is a disaster for the future of our country.

Inflation was high under the Labour Government but it was high across the world economy. Many people think that it was to do with the way that the United States funded the Vietnam war and the way that dollars were poured into the international economy. Britain's level of inflation was no worse than the average in the OECD countries. Although there has been a fall in inflation in recent years in Britain, there has also been one throughout the OECD countries. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> Look at the figures. Conservative Members are so full of ideology that they do not bother to look at any facts. The drop in inflation in Britain is lower than the average in OECD countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a great deal of truth in what my hon. Friend says. In the period 1974–76, inflation rates were comparable throughout western Europe and the United States, as Conservative Members well know if they care to cast their minds back or look it up. Does my hon. Friend agree that, with the Government's policy of high interest rates, inflation rates in Britain are considerably higher, and rising faster, than in other countries in western Europe? The free market monetarist lunatics in the Conservative party are leading us into an inflationary spiral.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be honest with my hon. Friend, I have not looked at detailed figures on the international comparisons of the past 12 months, but given what we know about what is happening in our economy and the growth in the rate of inflation, he must be correct.

see that the British rate of inflation was substantially higher than that of all of our major competitors. Not one of them came anywhere near the high year-on-year rate of 25.9 per cent. in August 1975. I do not mind how often she tries to distort the figures and talks about the average fall in the rates of inflation. The fact remains that we were then a high-inflation country and the hardest hit were the very people whom the hon. Lady is trying to protect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Lady responds, I make a plea to the Committee. In the Chamber, a debate on public expenditure and things national and international is taking place. May I request that we keep the debate in this Committee relevant? An exchange of views on interest rates over the past 15 years is not entirely relevant to the matters that we are debating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that that is true, but let me say first to the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) that I never wriggle and I think that most people would agree that I am not wriggling.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said, "Don't wriggle," and "Don't distort." I consider that to be abusive. It is fairly mild abuse but it is certainly not friendly and it is certainly not a rational exchange of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall get out the figures for the hon. Gentleman and send them to him. Perhaps we shall draw them to the attention of the Committee if the Chair would be so kind as to let us return to the subject on a future occasion. We shall have the facts in front of us and that is a much better way to proceed than exchanging abuse about what the facts really are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says, "Low pay isn't a problem because lots of low-paid people live in households headed by people who are not low paid. Isn't that wonderful?" First, we know what the statistics are, and the Minister keeps failing to respond to them. I shall quote the figures from memory; I know that they are roughly right. Some 4.4 million households in Britain are living in poverty and are headed by a low-paid wage earner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the reason why so many low-paid workers live in households that are headed by someone who is not low paid is because overwhelmingly, the low-paid people in our economy are women workers. When the Minister says that most low-paid workers live in households that are not low-paid so that is OK, he is saying that it is OK to continue the practice in our economy of offering to women low-paid, low-level employment that pays them badly and does not use their talents and skills. That is the pattern of employment of women in our economy if one looks overall at where the majority of women are working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal of pretence about the Prime Minister's newly-found greenery and her concern for
	<span class='label label-info column'>446</span>
the interests of women—I think her interest is art this week—as the Government do their polling and find that they are losing out here and there. We have heard all the rhetoric about the Government's concern for the advancement of women, the review of legislation to look after the interests of women, the need for women to return to the labour market because there is going to be a decline in the number of young workers, the need for women to train, have skills and be promoted and the provision of better child care. What the Minister has told us today shows that that is all verbiage. The Government are quite happy with the situation in which the overwhelming majority of women workers in our country will be low-paid workers and it does not matter because they might live in a household where someone else is earning a better income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that in London, the figure for the last full year for the average pay for women was £79 a week less than for men? That figure is for adult workers taken on on exactly the same full-time basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised by that. I think that women get 75p for every £1 across the economy, but when we go shopping it costs the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the statistics and we all recognise that the earnings of women, whether in the manual sector or across the board, are lower than those of males. For manual workers, from 1976 to 1979 the percentage of the male earnings for females fell from 60.5 per cent. to 59.4 per cent., whereas under this Government they have gone up again to 61.5 per cent. For all workers, the figures are even more marked than they are for manual workers. From 1976 to 1979, female earnings declined from 64.3 per cent. to 62.1 per cent. of male earnings, whereas under this Government they have risen from 62.1 per cent. to 66.1 per cent. The performance of the hon. Lady's Government was pretty pathetic in the sector about which she is levelling accusations against the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am not a Minister, I do not have a team of officials to scurry around and provide pieces of paper. But I am aware of the movement in women's wages, and the impression given by those figures does not coincide with the truth. I am also well aware of the Government's misuse of statistics and the constant change of starting dates in order to claim improvements. For some purposes it is 1979, but for other purposes it is 1983. The Government talk as though the economy did not grow annually until 1979 and that any increase in levels of earnings or spending on benefits year on year is a massive gain by the Tory Government rather than the experience of this and every other developed economy in every single year since the second world war.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to the misuse of statistics. When we debated child benefit, the

	<span class='label label-info column'>447</span>
Secretary of State for Social Security said that more than 70 per cent. of potential recipients of child benefit earned more than the average wage. I was astounded by that remark and I went to the Library and—because it has been suggested that my arithmetic may not be very good—I asked the Library to provide me with tables to justify the figure. I have before me tables that demonstrate quite adequately that, using linear interpolation, which will overstate the result, the figure is at best 48 per cent. of families. That is a long away below 70 per cent. I sent the table and the original 	<i>Hansard</i> with a letter to the Secretary of State and asked him to explain to me the figures and how they were arrived at. I am still awaiting a reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not surprised. Every week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, we see a certain well-known female politician downstairs with great sheaves of papers who, when asked a difficult question, reels off figures put together in distorted ways with different starting rates in order to pretend that everything in our country is better than it ever was. Conservative Members will defend that, but we know that in other guises our country has never been so divided. That might be good in their view, but it is extremely bad in the view of the Opposition. All the statistics show that more people are less well off than they have ever been. The divide between the top and the bottom is greater than it has ever been, yet somehow all those changes disappear from any of the statistics that the Government quote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That certainly applies to women. I cannot remember the year that the Equal Pay Act was passed—it was during the period of the previous Labour Government—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) says that it was 1975. There was an improvement in women's average rates of pay over a significant number of years. That has now come to a halt and begun to go backwards. I do not believe the impression given by the figures that the Minister quoted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Lady is incorrect. I have always supported the idea that there should be equal pay for equal work. In fact, the legislation that brought in equal pay for women pushed the average down because a large number of employers segregated women out of high-paid jobs where they were perhaps paid 90 per cent. of a man's wage to women-only jobs. The average went down immediately after that legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. I must say that I am shocked that he supports equal pay. I thought that everything that he believed in was wrong. I find that one thing that he believes in appears to be right and egalitarian.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After equal pay for equal work was introduced, a number of women in mixed occupations made gains. Some employers, of course, moved to segregate in order not to come under the legislation. That is why the movement now is towards equal pay for work of equal value which we have had to incorporate into
	<span class='label label-info column'>448</span>
our law as a consequence of European decisions. But there was a whole period of gain becaue of the equal pay legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are not concerned with facts; they are concerned only with their own ideology. The statistics are available: the gains ground to a halt, as the hon. Gentleman said, because of job segregation. However, after a significant period of gain, women could make further gains only by obtaining equal pay for work of equal value. They tended to be concentrated in segregated occupations and therefore could not compare their wages with those of men. So the hon. Gentleman is only half right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister went on to say that the position had improved also because of the drop in the number of people who would be better off on benefit than at work. One way of achieving that is to cut people's entitlement to benefit, and the Government have done that. Last Friday night, a man of 59 came to see me in my advice bureau because he had received information about his income support and was surprised to see that it had not risen. I had to explain how the Government had conned him and others with transitional protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government knew that if they had introduced the new system and chopped the money of massive numbers of people across the country, there would have been uproar. Nevertheless they chopped people's money, but transitionally protected them so that they did not actually take a cut and inflation could steadily erode the benefit. In that way, claimants would gradually get used to a lower level of benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once I had explained that to my constituent, he said that he already had little respect for the Government but now had even less. That man had worked all his life—from the age of 14 until six years go, when he was made redundant. He spent his redundancy money on setting up a little business, but it went bust. His mother, who used to live with him, died two years ago, and now he has nothing. Although he has worked hard all his life, he now finds that even his small transitional protection has been eroded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another constituent aged 53, who has been unemployed for four or five years, was offered seven weeks' work. He went to the jobcentre informally and asked whether he could take the seven weeks' work and was told that it would cause no trouble. The work was not particularly well paid, but the man wanted to work. When he went back on to benefit at the end of the seventh week, he was £3 a week worse off and had lost his transitional protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister cannot say that people's benefit is better than in the past when every week we meet people who are becoming worse off and losing their transitional protection. The Minister then has the cheek to quote tax benefit tables to show that fewer people who work would be better off on benefit. But there have always been people who prefer to work, even though they would be better off on benefit. The hon. Gentleman read the figures quickly and the only one that I caught was that previously 60,000 workers would have been better off on benefit and that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>449</span>
number had reduced. He then admitted, under pressure from my hon. Friend, that the Government had fiddled those tables, too, and taken out the average costs of getting to work. The Minister says that it would be unfair to include average costs of getting to work because some people walk and others take a bus. Therefore the Government have taken account of none of the costs of getting to work and pretend that everyone who would have been better off on benefit in the past is now better off working.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is unfortunate because, although he is perfectly fair, the fact that he mentioned the subject of bar rates in Birkenhead shows how his officials' minds work. He seemed to question the integrity of my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) by suggesting that bar work was available at £1 an hour in his constituency. I regret that my hon. Friend is not here and I hope that we can return to the subject later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The going rate for 16–18 year-olds is £35 to £50 a week, and many young people earn £50 from bar work. Before the abolition of the community programme and the introduction of the employment training scheme, which pays just a few pounds more than benefit, most of the advertisements in jobcentres like my local one were for community programme places. They offered rates of some £40 or £50. That was sometimes for part-time work, so the hourly rate was just over £1. That is a low rate, although some young people and women work for £1 an hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my advice bureau work, I sometimes have to ask people their incomes to fill in a form, or because of some bureaucrat with whom I have to work. The averge rate that women give is £60 to £70 a week. When men say that they earn £150 or £160 a week, that is considered a good wage. At that level they have no entitlement to family credit, but it is not a princely sum to earn when they can expect little improvement over their working lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is my experience of the miserable rates for which people are working, and young people and women work for as little as £1 an hour. But let us not get stuck on £1 an hour; £2 an hour is not enough either. Nothing less than £3.80 is enough—that is the standard that our amendments suggest and we stand by it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister concluded with a brave statement of the Government's free market philosophy. He said that it was not for the state but for competition and bargaining between individuals in the economy to say what it a reasonable wage. We have heard the Winston Churchill quote, but the Government are not even neutral. They are not leaving the matter to the free market in tune with their philosophy, but are adopting numerous measures, including the Bill, to try to force down wage levels. So let us not have lies of falsity. The Government are in favour of low pay and will use the employment service to push people into low-paid work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party believes that the free market is useful and is better than other mechanisms at distributing, say, consumer goods, but its excesses
	<span class='label label-info column'>450</span>
need regulation so that it can serve people in social communities. However, Conservative Members are obsessed with the free market and think that it produces perfection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have, for some time, pretended that the Council of Europe's decency threshold is meaningless. That is simply false. They may not wish to abide by it, but it exists, everyone knows what it means, and it is a target.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder how the hon. Lady can conceivably call it a Council of Europe decency threshold when the Council of Europe has never endorsed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 of the European Social Charter, to which this country is a signatory, enshrines the right of people to receive
	<br><blockquote><p>"fair remuneration sufficient for a decent standard of living".</p></blockquote>
The Council of Europe invites committees of experts from its member states to advise on the targets that would implement the aims of such conventions. The Government have not signed a document approving the decency threshold recommended by the committee of experts, but they are a signatory to the European Social Charter under which they promise to strive for fair levels of remuneration for workers. The Government know that that is the status of the Council of Europe decency threshold, but pretend that it does not exist because they are not in favour of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We used to be a signatory to an International Labour Organisation convention requiring minimum wage protection for the most vulnerable workers. That is an international, not just European, treaty signed by some 60 countries, including many poor countries. However, when the Government exempted young people from the protection of wages councils, we had to resile from our signature to that convention while poorer countries are still signatories and can comply with the requirements. Britain cannot, because we are no longer willing to protect the wages of our young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not have any falsity. There are international treaties and international standards, yet the Government are so determined to encourage low pay that they are resiling from international treaties or ignoring our obligations under them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now deal with the statistical point demonstrated so ineptly by the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce), who I see has now gone—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sorry; he is here. It was incredibly inept to try and make his point, which is a true point, by asking us to imagine that there were only two people in the world. If there were only two people in the world, I do not think that there would be wages. There would be problems other than wage levels to worry about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not claim to be an expert in mathematics, but I think that all Opposition Members are numerate. They know that using an example with only two people confuses the hon. Gentleman's argument. It makes me suspect that the hon. Gentleman has had the point put to him in the past, but has not fully understood it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is right that if we sought to reach the target of the Council of Europe's decency threshold, we could not reach the proposed level immediately. The national minimum wage would have to be introduced at a lower level and phased in, with encouragement given to low-paying sectors to invest and move up market. That would be good for our economy and competitiveness. It would take a minimum of five years to reach the Council of Europe's decency threshold for all workers in Britain, but it is entirely achievable. However, once there, we would be in a statistical trap: the average would move up and, if we kept chasing it, it would keep moving up. The hon. Gentleman is right. We understand his point and even agree with it. That is why the Low Pay Unit has given a similar definition, but, to avoid the trap, it uses the median rather than the average. There are simple statistical ways of avoiding the trap. The hon. Gentleman has a point, but using two people as an example is not the best way of explaining it. There are other ways of dealing with the argument, which is not as devastating as he appears to think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that amendment No. 98 was unacceptable because it would reinstate the existing right to refuse a job which does not pay the going rate. He said that the Government were trying to delete the concept of a going rate. They want people to broaden their horizons and look for any job after the permitted period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is not accurate in describing the change that he wants to introduce. The framework of the existing law is that, when people become unemployed, they are allowed three months to look for a job within the professional skill level and background that they had previously. After that, they are expected to broaden their horizons and look for jobs in other fields. They are expected to look at any job, but not one that pays less than the going rate for a decent employer in the district.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to use the employment service to force people into rotten, low-paid jobs that no one wants because they pay less than the going rate. Once that happens, unemployed people will be forced into low-paid jobs which will results in the spiral of undercutting of wages, speeded up by the public employment service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are expected to broaden their horizons at present. The change that the Government want to introduce is not broadening horizons but lowering wage expectations. Let us call it what it really is. The Government want a change. They want to iron out
	<span class='label label-info column'>452</span>
a rigidity and get rid of the motion in our legislation that if a job does not pay the basic, decent going rate in an area, an unemployed person will not be forced to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are getting rid of that provision, so that unemployed people will be forced into taking jobs that are so low-paid that no one would would take them otherwise. The Government will force the unemployed into taking them by threatening to withdraw benefit. That is why the Minister will not accept amendment No. 98. Let us not use words to mislead: this is nothing to do with rigidity, or broadening horizons. It is about giving the state the power to force the unemployed to accept extremely low-paid work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 100 says that no one should be forced to take a job that pays less than the benefits to which he is entitled. As we all know, benefit levels are based on studies of the basic minimum that people need to keep alive. On benefit, they live on a basically decent and healthy way, but with no frills. We are asking for something very simple: no one should be forced to take a job that will pay less than the absolute minimum necessary to keep him alive. The Government are saying that they cannot allow that. The Minister argued this morning that this proposal was no change to what had always been the situation in the past. That, too, is misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today we discussed the deletion of the word "suitable", but I shall not go over the debate at length. In the past, no one could be requried to take a job unless it was suitable. The concept of suitability included the level of remuneration. Therefore, people could not be forced to take jobs at rates of pay that were lower than the level of benefit on which they needed to live. We have lost "suitable" and the situation is transformed. The fact that the Minister will not accept amendment No. 100 means that people will be as harassed and threatened by the withdrawal of their benefits on a weekly basis—it will not happen just once a year—into accepting jobs, which, as we know from the notes of clauses, could be part time or temporary, which pay them less than they are entitled to on benefit—that is, the minimum amount required to keep themselves living at a decent standard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had our debate, and the Minister has rejected all our amendments. I do not have much respect for the Government anyway, but it shocks me that on and on they go, treating people in this intolerable way. The full impact of the proposals will not hit the streets until a couple of months after the Bill is enacted. We shall then see a process of erosion. At first, people will not be forced into accepting the lowest of the low, but over time, as wage expectations lower and people get more desperate, things will get worse and worse. That is the Government's shameful strategy. We should not treat our people like that. The economy will not benefit from it either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The debate on the low-pay threshold—on which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short spoke so well—is logically followed by a debate on the suitability of work and the authority on which the appropriate Department officials will recommend people for jobs and the suitability of those jobs. The heart of the Bill is that people who work for low wages and in bad conditions, who lose their jobs and do not live well on benefits, will be pressured by the Bill into accepting low-paid jobs that are not suitable for them, and are often in dirty and dangerous conditions. I invite anyone who doubts my word on that, and doubts the word of my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood about the levels of low pay now prevalent in inner cities, to come with me to my constituency this evening. I shall show them places where people work in dirty, unsafe and dangerous conditions. I shall show them the places where people are forced to work for slave-labour rates of pay. I am anxious that, because of the powers that the Government take unto themselves under the Bill, people will be not only encouraged or recommended but forced to take such work in dangerous conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 90 would delete section 20(1)(d) of the Social Security Act 1975, which lays down one of the grounds for disqualification for unemployment benefit. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"he has without good cause refused or failed to carry out any official recommendations given to him with a view to assisting him to find suitable employment, being recommendations which were reasonable having regard to his circumstances and to the means of obtaining that employment usually adopted in the district in which he resides".</p></blockquote>
There are two reasons for removing that paragraph. Even if claimants are expected to accept jobs at unfairly low wages and in substandard conditions, it is quite wrong that any Government Department or agency should recommend anyone to seek such jobs, thereby openly condoning the actions of bad employers and acting as their recruiting agent. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>454</span>
would be wrong even if there were no penalty attached to failure to comply with such recommendations, but, officials may use the penalty of the loss of benefit for up to six months—a fine of £900.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employers are not fined for making people work in dirty, dangerous, unsafe and low-paid conditions, and plenty such conditions can be found. Such employers are the gods of the free-market economy, and are told that they are doing a good job. Employers should have a duty to give employees secure, guaranteed, permanent employment and a decent level pay. The Government are removing any such protections, and they are already only minimally enshrined in legislation. Instead, poor people are being fined for refusing to accept jobs in such conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for deleting the paragraph is that we have already been told in previous debates that the penalty for failure to carry out official recommendations on job finding will be having one's benefit cut off under the "actively seeking employment" test. We have also been told that a first offence may be dealt with by administering a caution rather than a fine, whereas section 20 imposes a fine of up to £900. Is it on for there to be a double jeopardy on unemployed people? They will get a caution under clause 7, and under clause 9 they face a potential fine of £900 if they do not carry out the Department's recommendations. That is inconsistent. It is strange that the Bill is so badly drafted that the amendment is necessary, but, perhaps it is intentionally drafted that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put some points to the Minister, but I do not want to take too long because I am aware of the time that we have spent on previous discussions of issues not too far removed from the issues that we are debating here. We can bandy statistics around all evening, and no doubt we shall, about the number of vacancies registered at jobcentres, the number not registered at jobcentres and the compatibility of those vacancies. The June 1988 figures for London show that there were 35,052 vacancies. The unemployment unit's telephone poll of VAT-registered employers in London—which tok a legitimate sample of around 1,000—found that, if the figures were extrapolated, there would be approximately 150,000 vacancies in Greater London. That includes jobcentre registered vacancies and others. At that time, registered unemployment in London was at least twice that figure. Therefore, there is a considerable mismatch between all known vacancies and all unemployed people seeking work. That presupposes that people seeking work would be able to find work suitable to their experience, skills or aspirations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thinking behind the clause is that unemployed people actually like being unemployed and so the Bill is designed to force them into employment and force them to seek work. I know many unemployed people. I meet many in my surgery, as I am sure do other hon. Members. I do not know of any unemployed people who actually enjoy being out of work. We discussed this earlier, and we shall no doubt do so
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0274">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>455</span>
again. Unemployed people do not like the humiliation of having no job to go to and the resulting loss of self respect. Therefore, the Bill is fundamentally misconceived and ill thought out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, the Minister hit the nail on the head when he said that it was partly an economic question of providing work for people. I agree with that, but it is also a question of society as a whole recognising its responsibility to everyone. In the past, the social security system recognised that society as a whole had a responsibility to everyone, because it created a safety net. Since 1979, the safety nets have been got at, first with a pair of scissors, then with a pair of shears and finally with a mowing machine, and now it barely exists. In case anyone believes that the safety net is still there, the penalty clauses in the Bill will be invoked to force people to take unsuitable jobs at which they are unskilled, and in which they have few prospects and are unlikely to get any training. If they refuse those jobs, they lose benefit. The Bill is a charter for an unhappy, inefficient workforce and for low pay. It is also a charter to ruin the aspirations of unemployed people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployed people may have skills that are not in demand, at the moment. For example, watchmaking used to be quite a thriving industry in south Islington and Clerkenwell. It then went into long-term decline because of competition from Japan and other countries, with cheaper watches being brought in and so on. The skills also declined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will someone who lost his job in a mechanical skill industry like that be told that unless he takes any job that is offered, he will be treated as someone who is not actively seeking work and not accepting suitable employment, which is decided for him by local officials? Will he be forced to take some other job in some other industry, where the prospects are possibly extremely dim? He may wish to hang on to try to get a job commensurate with his skills, so that he can develop his own ability. What is so offensive about the penalty clauses in the Bill is that they do not give people the opportunity to develop and think about what they are trying to do. The pressure is on to accept any job at any level of pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was much discussion on the last series of amendments about the European decency threshold, which my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood proposed. I am a strong supporter of the principle of the national minimum wage. I am sponsored by the National Union of Public Employees, and it strongly supports it. It could hardly do anything else, as a large proportion of NUPE members work in low paid jobs. These are often part-time and temporary jobs for contract cleaning and contract catering companies in the school meal service and the Health Service. The bargaining power of such workers is extremely limited and so they are often forced to accept very low wages. Only through the statutory imposition of a national minimum wage and national minimum conditions of life will those people receive the kind of protection that many others seek for themselves. That is why my union supports it. My union also supports the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the powers of officials to send people to very low paid jobs. We
	<span class='label label-info column'>456</span>
have heard anecdotal evidence of wages of £1 an hour, £2 an hour and slightly more than that. No member of the Committee would be happy to earn less than £5 or £10 an hour for the work he or she does. No member of the Committee would be particularly happy at the end of an 80 hour week as a Member of Parliament to receive only £160. My arithmetic is not brilliant, but I am numerate and I work out that a 40 hour week at £2 an hour comes to £80 per week. While an individual might get some benefit beyond that in the form of housing benefit or, depending on whether he has children, child benefit and so on, it would be a low wage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Behind the clause is a desire to hand power to local officials to tell people to take jobs. They will force people to work for £1.50 an hour as a presser in the clothing industry, or £2 an hour as an early morning cleaner or £2.20 as bar staff. They will tell people that if they refuse, they will lose benefit and will be fined £900. That is not the job of local officials. They should not be given such a total power over claimants that they can force them to accept totally unsuitable work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that officials should take all sorts of other factors into consideration. I believe him, but the Bill does not say anything about them. It gives local officials an enormous discretion. The whole trend in current social security legislation is towards discretionary powers and endless regulations, only some of which are debated in the House, and usually decided by a negative resolution. I know many officials who work in employment and social security. They do not want this discretion—they do not like it. They do not want to play God over claimants. They would prefer to work with claimants to try and help them rather force them into taking unsuitable jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept that it is wholly wrong for officials to be given that power and that the Bill is wrong to enforce people to take employment that is suitable. That condones bad employers, low wages and deskilling work when we should be encouraging people to take suitable jobs and take part in training schemes to move into industries that have prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government came to office in 1979 on a claim that Labour was not working. Even after 22 changes in the basis of calculating unemployment figures, unemployment is still double the level of 1979. The Government are obsessed with reducing unemployment figures and pushing people into unsuitable jobs. They are removing all the safety nets and if people will not accept the jobs offered, they become non-persons. We heard from the Minister last week that there are 750,000 non-persons in this country. They are neither working nor registered as unemployed, so they receive no benefit and are dependent on someone else. The Government claim that they want to get rid of the dependency culture. What is more of a dependency culture than not giving people the benefit that is rightfully theirs and forcing them to become dependent on someone else? I hope that the Minister will understand what our amendment seeks to do and accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must tell the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) that the clause does not condone bad employers and it is not about pushing people into unsuitable work, nor is it about rates of pay, to which he referred and which have been covered at considerable length in previous amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 90 and 91 seek to limit the circumstances in which someone may be disqualified from the receipt of unemployment benefit. Amendment No. 90 would remove the provision dealing with someone who, without good cause, refuses or fails to carry out an official recommendation or suggestion as to how to pursue the opportunity of a job. The purpose of such a recommendation is to assist that person to find work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a long-standing provision. It is not a new one that has been invented by the clause. When there is good reason for believing that a course of action would be fruitful in the search for employment, a claimant should be expected to take it. It cannot be right for someone to receive unemployment benefit if he is placing obstacles in the way of securing work, or is not following up ideas that have been put to him. It is not an unfair provision if we bear in mind that the clause provides for the claimant to show good cause for refusal or failure to follow up those recommendations. If he can show such good cause, he will retain his unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 91 would remove the provision introduced by the Employment Act 1988. If someone refuses or fails to take advantage of a place on an approved training scheme, he will be disqualified from unemployment benefit. No such training scheme, apart from the youth training scheme, whose potential participants have no entitlement to unemployment benefit, has been formally approved. I can only reiterate the assurance of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment. Employment training is not approved training in this sense, and he does not, at the moment, intend to make it so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The power is important. When accepting a training place rather than remaining on benefit, which is clearly the right step for an individual claimant, it is consistent that there should be a penalty for failing to take that step, as there is for failing to take up an employment offer without good cause. My right hon. Friend would need to be satisfied about the quality and relevance of training before giving it formal approval and bringing it within the scope of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would be a backward step and would suggest to claimants that, without good cause, they could ignore advice from the employment service on how best to achieve a return to work. That would not be consistent with the Government's intention to ensure that people pursue every sensible avenue to obtain a job. The provision applies where jobs are available to be pursued. I ask my hon. Friend to reject the amendments if the hon. Member for Islington, North presses them to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>458</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we feel strongly, otherwise we would not have tabled the amendments. Does the Minister agree that a claimant who did not accept an employment benefit officer's recommendations would be cut off under the actively seeking work test? The clause contains an element of double jeopardy and double provision to injure claimants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I do not believe that officials would seek to put claimants in double jeopardy as he suggests, but I understand his fear. I will come back to the Committee on this matter because I want to be certain that my reply is accurate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The efficiency and suitability of many of the training schemes into which claimants are encouraged is open to question. What considerations will be taken into account if claimants refuse to go on schemes that they consider to be unsuitable, and to provide poor quality training, and which, are in reality, nothing short of cheap labour?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have covered the question. Only one training scheme is approved—the youth training scheme—and it cannot apply in the circumstances to which the amendments refer because young people on YTS are not entitled to unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Currently, no other training scheme is approved, so refusal or unwillingness to go on one could not be used to show that a claimant was unwilling to take good advice. The argument would have to be carried further. If a scheme was unsatisfactory and claimants could show that it did not suit them, they would have good cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the end, the adjudication officer would have to weigh up the matter. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State said earlier, we cannot determine how the adjudication officer will use his discretion in a particular set of circumstances. The facts will be different in each case and it is the adjudication officer's job to arrive at his decision independently. There is currently no training scheme, approved in the formal sense that can be cited in disallowing benefit. However, refusal to take up a place on such a scheme might, in future be a factor that the adjudication officer would take into account, bearing in mind the reasons that the claimant gave for not taking up the recommendation. The decision would depend on those reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
