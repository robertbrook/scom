	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 140, in page 57, line 17, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'17A. In paragraph 4 of Schedule 10 to the Income Support (General Regulations 1987. at the end there shall be added the following subparagraph—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(c) a person as his home where that person was regularly and substantially engaged in caring for the claimant or the claimant's partner at a time when the claimant or his partner was occupying the whole or part of the premises.".'</p></blockquote>
I remind the Committee that the title of the schedule is "Minor and Consequential Amendments". The amendments we considered earlier today were minor; they did not involve large amounts of money but they would have made a great deal of difference, particularly those relating to the attendance allowance. The compensation we sought from the Government was much less than was offered in compensation to chicken farmers—much less, perhaps than the briefing errors that are now handed to the Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A principle is a stake on amendment No. 140. It will cost the Government some money. We ought to make sure that we do not take a carer's home away when the person he or she is looking after goes into long-term residential care and does not return home. Such carers may lose the home they have lived in for a long time. The value of a person's former home counts as part of his or her capital when calculating income support. After the great gaffe during the introduction of the social security changes last year the Government eventually agreed to raise the capital limit. No one with capital over £6,000 is entitled to income support, so the value of their home is usually enough to cancel any entitlement. Conservative Members argued quite forcefully in the Chamber that the limit ought to be higher, but they lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A constituent of mine reached retirement age, having taken out a retirement pension 10 years earlier. When he retired he decided to cash in his pension, which took him over the £6,000 limit. He tried to sort the matter out at the DSS but was told that he was not entitled to income support as he had too much capital wrapped up in his home. The officers told him to take his wife on holiday and spend some of his money. Unfortunately, they did not know that his wife was bedridden, that he was caring for her and that they had been unable to go on holidary for years. In those circumstances, it is ludricrous that the limit should make life more difficult for people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Difficulties can arise when people go into residential care. They may be regarded as temporarily absent from their home for a period of usually not more than
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1082</span>
12 months, during which time the value is disregarded. Once the 12 months period is past and the absence from the home becomes permanent, its value is taken into account. There are only two exceptions to that rule: first, where the premises are occupied by a relative who is over 60 or incapacitated, and, secondly, where they are occupied by the claimant's wife or husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendment would add a third exemption. If the home were occupied either wholly or in part by a person who had looked after the claimant, that home would not be taken into account. If the value of the home is to be measured against income support, the carer may have to move out so that the money on the home can be realised to pay for a residential place of care. That is unacceptable. It is unreasonable that people who have cared for disabled, sick or elderly people for many years but who do not happen to be over 60 should be compelled to leave what has become their permanent home. It is also unreasonable that an elderly carer who is not a relative of the claimant should be forced to move out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should provide a third exemption to ensure that carers of people who have moved to a hospice to die do not lose their homes. We should amend the Bill here an now. The amendment should be accepted. It would not cause the Government economic problems. The Minister has often said that we should wait for more information, such as the OPCS survey. I wonder whether digging for more information on the social picture is the real issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we dealt with the provisions relating to the availability for work test, we had the impression that the Department of Employment was the driving force behind the Bill. But the later stages, minor amendments to schedule 6, are Treasury driven. I hope that the Minister will stand up to the Treasury and demand that minor but basic adjustments to social security are made. They will not cost the Government massive amounts of money but they will make a real difference to the people who are most in need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listended carefully to the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). I recently had a case to which I do not have an answer. It would help if the Minister could deal with the matter when he replies. A spinster daughter has looked after her father for many years. He is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is incapable of making any decisions. He has now gone into an old people's home. His daughter, who has given up 40 years of her life to look after him, fears that whe will lose her home because it will have to be sold to meet the cost of keeping the father in the old people's home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 140 would allow the value of a claimant's former home to be disregarded in income support if it is occupied by a person who once cared for the claimant and/or the claimant's partner. Property is disregarded rather more liberally now than it was under supplementary benefit, or previous Governments. It will continue to be ignored when it is occupied by the claimant's husband or wife, or by an aged or incapacitated relative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1083</span>
Although I appreciate the merits of particular case, it would not be right in general to extend the disregard to younger, healthy relatives or to friends who will often be able to provide for themselves but who may at some point have provided care for the claimant. It would be wrong to enable them to gain from the claimant the use of a capital asset while the claimant has to apply for benefit to support himself or herself. Therefore I cannot accept the amendment as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I have said, I accept that there may be real hardship in particular cases. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell), unbeknown to me, has come up with the sort of example that occurred to me when I saw the amendment. There are some difficult cases—they may be small in number—where as my hon. Friend suggested, a single daughter who has always lived with her parents and who has nursed them through a period of incapacity might be in danger of losing the home that she has known for many years because she is not yet of retirement age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To assist the hon. Member for Leeds, West and my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, I shall look more closely at what is possible and desirable. Any proposal would certainly be less widely drawn than the hon. Gentleman's amendment, but I should like to ensure that we are not missing out any difficult cases, such as the one mentioned, where there is particular hardship that could be remedied by a minor change in the rules. With that concession—it is only that I shall look at the issue, and there is no guarantee of what the conclusion will be—I hope that the hon. Gentlman will be willing to withdraw the amendment, at least at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was almost predictable. I emphasise only one point. I am glad that the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) gave the example that he did. My hon. Friend's are reminding me that it is his best speech in the Committee. I agree with him. I know that it is not an isolated and difficult case; it is quite common.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we receive the OPCS surveys—some are coming through now—we already know that disabled and sick people are among the poorest groups in society; by and large, they are not the richest. What is more, those who care for the sick and elderly tend to be among the poorest people. They have part-time, temporary and low-paid jobs, as "Social Trends"—The Government's own document—clearly illustrates. It is not as though we are asking for wealthy, people to be exempted. We were told that child benefit would go to the wealthy, but the majority of the people who care for other people are in difficult circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sometimes bridle at the way that a home is referred to by the Government, although the description is not confined to the Government. From my long experience of housing, I have become convinced that a house should be turned into a home and that that should be the heart of our community. However, the description used is not "home" or "house"; we are down to the Under-Secretary's phrase—"the use of a capital asset". I remind him that that is someone's home. If he cannot support the amendment, he is saying that some-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1084</span>
one who looks after a sick person will lose his or her home. That is what it means. If does not mean that he or she can move round the property market and make a killing as a result of the sick person—who could be a parent—going into a hospice, hospital or elderly person's home. Such people could literally lose what has been the family home for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister speaks of looking more carefully, but when will he turn his gaze to policy making? Between now and Report, will he consider the matter and bring forward an amendment to take account of the circumstances that we have outlined? If he can reassure me on that point, I shall look favourable upon withdrawing the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did refer at one point to the home as a capital asset. I am sure that if he thought about it, the hon. Gentleman would concede that the carer for whom that dwelling is not his home, or has not long been his home would come into the purview of the amendment. I used the word "home" when I referred to the particular example that my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) mentioned, where undoubtedly it was the home. There are distinctions to be made. It is possible that the carer, not the claimant, would be the beneficiary of the change. The carer is likely to be younger and perfectly fit. The claimant would not lose out, unless the carer was his daughter, in which case he would be concerned about her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that it is not the claimant who loses—that is the basis of my case—but the carer. Why should a person be penalised financially and lose his or her home for caring for someone who goes into a hospice, an elderly person's home or into hospital? We should support carers as positively and as practically as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We should, but not every carer falls into that category, which is why we should consider the definition carefully. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman whether an amendment can be tabled by Report. However, it does not depend on the OPCS report. It is more a question of the needs of the infirm and disabled and of justice for carers in particular and special circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it were simply a question of hard cases, and if we could use the social security rules to appeal in hard cases, I might be able to withdraw the amendment. However, the law is as it stands, and carers are penalised. We have not yet had the debate on the Girffiths report, which recommends that there should be more care in the community. If a person cares for someone at home, and that person moves on, the carer will be penalised. 1 ask the Committee to support the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For Fins-bury Park, not Finsbury, Mr. Winterton. There is a world of difference between them. It is one of the ironies of history that Finsbury Park started out as a suburb of Finsbury, but Finsbury is now wealthy and Finsbury Park is poor. Such things are probably due to the market economy. I hold all Conservative Members responsible for the privations of Finsbury Park.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to move amendment No. 316, in page 57, line 17, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"17A.(1) In regulation 14 of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987—
	<ol>
	<li>In paragraph (1). after "19' there shall be inserted the words 'or to whom paragraph (3) applies'.</li>
	<li>After paragraph (2) there shall be inserted the following paragraph—</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) This paagraph applies to a person who—
	<ol>
	<li>is aged 19 but less than 20;</li>
	<li>is a person to whom regulation 12 would apply if he were aged less than 19;</li>
	<li>attained the age of 19 after the last day of the summer term preceding the college or school year applicable to his course, and</li>
	<li>during the two years immediately preceding the beginning of his course was neither in remunerative work within the meaning of regulation 5 nor available for employment within the meaning of regulation 9.'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) In regulation 61 of those regulations, in the definition of 'student', after the words less than 19' there shall be inserted the words or to whom regulation 14(3) applies'.".</p></blockquote>
When moving this amendment during the final innings of the Committee, I feel as though I am coming in to bat at number eight against two demonic slow bowlers on the Conservative Benches. Amendment No. 316 deals with young people. It is promoted partly by the Child Poverty Action Group. Young people aged 19 completing their basic education—GCSEs, A-levels or vocational courses—at school or colleges of further education lost entitlement of benefit in April 1988 when supplementary benefit was replaced by income support. The amendment would allow 19-year-olds to complete their education under broadly the same conditions as those that applied under supplementary benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Young people my constituency have lost out as a result of the new regulations. They can no longer
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1086</span>
receive any benefit with which to complete full-time basic standards of education which are a passport to higher education. It is essential that everyone should be able to complete their basic education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the supplementary benefit scheme it was assumed that most young people completed their basic education before they reached the age of 19. However, it was later recognised that some young people may require an extra year. That is quite common, for reasons such as illness, bereavement and family problems, or difficulties over learning a new language if the student has recently arrived in Britain, or simply because of late academic development. The regulations were altered so that supplementary benefit could be paid to 19-year-olds to give them the opportunity to their complete secondary education. They were often able to claim benefit. The qualifying rule was that the student in question should be 19 and should have spent the previous two years continuously engaged in full-time non-advanced education. The law was, therefore, beneficial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Changes to the regulations in April 1987 meant that some young people at school or college, living independently, were entitled to supplementary benefit in their own right after reaching the age of 19. They were young people who were orphans, with no one else acting in the place of parents; estranged from their parents; not being supported by their parents, because their parents were sick, in prison, or unable to enter the country; parents, who had a child living with them; disabled, and therefore had a reduced chance of finding a job. Those are important categories. Orphans, with no one acting for them as parents, who wished to complete their secondary education had to be able to live independently. They had to leave the children's home where they were living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is tragic that a growing number of children in Britain are forced to leave home as young as 15 or 16 because of horrendous family disputes. We discussed that issue a few weeks ago when my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) moved a series of amendments to help them. Those children are not supported by their parents, because they are unemployed, sick or in prison. The number of people who will not be supported by their parents in future might grow when every adult over the age of 18 living with their parents has to pay the poll tax. The head of the household will be severally liable for the collection of that tax, even if there is a reduced rate for people who are unemployed or studying. The number of 19-year olds who are entitled is not enormous, but it is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before 1987 those young people were awarded "extra-statutory" payments so that they could finish their courses. That provision was in force from April 1989 onwards. In its report to the Social Security Advisory Committee the then Department of Health and Social Security justified the change of entitlement under the law:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the extension of benefit rights to some young people whose parents are unable to maintain them in non-advanced education is a recognition that the State should in these cases step in to enable a young person to make the decision to continue in education, rather than opt for unemployment."</p></blockquote>
The main thrust of our argument in support of the amendment is the then Department of Health and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1087</span>
Social Security's statement, made only four years ago. I hope that the Minister will support us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April 1988 the introduction of income support reversed the position for 19-year-olds on their own. The changes made it impossible for parents to claim benefit for a 19-year-old dependant who is still at school or college. In other words, only three years after the DHSS said that it supported young people being able to continue their education as a choice rather than having to seek work or unemployment benefit, the Social Security Act 1988 reversed that provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the income support regulations, claimants with dependants at school or college can obtain benefit for them until they are 19. From their 19th birthday, benefit will not be paid. For a family on income support, that means a loss, from 10 April 1989, of £27.40 a week from their basic benefit. That loss will be at the expense of other members of the family, or the youngster must give up his or her education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a family where a 19-year-old wishes to continue his or her full-time education and there are younger brothers or sisters who are also at school, tension will be caused by the Government's change in the regulations. The young person will no longer receive benefit to enable him to continue his education, he will thus become a complete burden on the family. If the young person gave up his education and sought benefit as an unemployed person actively seeking work, he could get benefit. If he found a job, he would have an income. It is wholly unfair that that relatively small group of young people should be penalised and prevented from continuing their further education.

I want to deal with the case of young people living independently; that is increasingly common. They will be in an even worse position. Under the income support regulations they are not entitled to any benefit once they reach the age of 19. If they are at school or college full-time, the Government have suggested that they should seek grants from the local education authority. The Child Poverty Action Group says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is unlikely that LEAs will be able or willing to meet the needs of the considerable numbers of 19-year-olds who are affected. Moreover, any help that is given will be discretionary, rather than as of right, as it was under SB."</p></blockquote>
That is important. A young woman in my constituency who is just over 19 wishes to complete her A-levels at a further education college in London. She is separated from her parents, with whom she has a difficult and bad relationship. It is in her interests to live apart from them. She has a flat of her own. She ought to receive housing benefit and I hope that she eventually she will, but she is not entitled to any benefit for the purpose of study. She does not qualify for income support. Moreover, she cannot get a grant from her local education authority because its discretionary grants budget has been cut year after year. It is very difficult to obtain a discretionary award. A lot of persuasion and letter writing to the LEA is required. Unfortunately, competition takes place between mature students who legitimately wish to take a course of study and 19-year-olds who are stuck in this unfortunate trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the student in my constituency is successful in obtaining help from the local education authority, she
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1088</span>
may be able to complete her A-levels, but she has now lost so much time and benefit that she has had to borrow a great deal of money from friends and relatives. She feels that she can go on no longer. She is a promising student and hopes eventually to study medicine or dentistry. I fear that unless we can get help for her so that she can complete her education at that FE college, she will have to give it up, work in a shop or restaurant, and possibly return to studying later. Anyone who has tried to return to full-time study after several years' work will know that it is extremely difficult. She is a bright and promising student who should be able to offer a lot to the community and wants to do so. But sadly she will be a victim of this change unless our amendment is accepted.

I hope that the Government understand the spirit in which we move the amendment. We are asking for no more than the Department proposed in its April 1985 report to the Social Security Advisory Committee. Many of us have heard of young people who are deterred from entering two-year courses at school or college because they would be 19 years old when they finished the course. Thus a 17-year-old who has just completed GCSE or O-levels would enter the equivalent of sixth-form eduction, would be over the age of 19 by the time that that finished, and would therefore be financially penalised merely for reaching the age of 19.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Justification for that was given in a letter from the Minister to the Child Poverty Action Group in June 1988, which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Incomee support is intended to meet the day-to-day needs of those who cannot support themselves for reasons beyond their control and those who choose to remove themselves from the employment field to pursue education must look to the education authorities for funding."</p></blockquote>
These are nice words and it is easy to pass the buck. The local education authority to which I am referring is the Inner London education authority which, for most of the past 10 years, has received hardly any support from the Government for its activites. It has been severely penalised, has had to increase rates accordingly, and has subsequently been rate-capped. Considerable cuts are made every year in ILEA'S budget. ILEA is now run by the Government on an annual basis. Its rate is decided not by its members or by inner London ratepayers, but by 650 Members of Parliament who debate an order for one and a half hours, late at night, and take a whipped vote. That is not a satisfactory way to decide the needs of the largest education authority in Europe. I know that ILEA is to be abolished, but that is the current position. It is not sensible to say that students must look to education authorities to pay them because, in most cases, education authorities will be unlikely to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everyone must accept the importance of young people completing their education so that they can find jobs or prepare themselves for higher education. We are told that there will be a skills shortage in the next 10 years and that the demand for skilled and qualified labour is growing. But the provision is disfranchising a substantial number of young people from being able to pursue an education to which they have a right.

I do not know how much the amendment would cost, as I have not had the chance to find out or calculate it myself. However, investment in education is crucial and the Bill gives an opportunity to put right something that went badly wrong in the previous Social Security Act. In 1985 the Government supported the contention that 1 have put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment to the income support regulations changes the definitions of "young person" and of "student" in relation to people age 19. The effect of redefining "young person" would be to enable a family to claim an income support dependency addition for a 19-year-old in full-time, non-advanced education. The amendment would also permit 19-year-olds in full-time education to receive income support in their own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the major objectives of the reforms that came into force last April was to simplify by applying common rules to all benefits. Under the new scheme the upper age limit for dependency was brought into line.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was felt that the most appropriate level for a common ceiling was the long-standing child benefit upper age limit of 19. Wherever a line is drawn, it is inevitable that some people feel that they are, unfairly, on the wrong side of it. But by the age of 19, young people are past the age of majority, and most will have completed their secondary education—although I accept that some, for various reasons, have not—and have become independent of their parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All young people of 19 and over in full-time education are classed as students, and the recent White Paper on education has reaffirmed the Government's view that it should not be a function of the social security system to support students in either advanced or non-advanced education. As the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) correctly said, that is the responsibility of local education authorities, which have discretion to make awards. They are well placed to make judgments in such circumstances—more so than the Department of Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment, or give the hon. Gentleman any encouragement that it may be possible to do so if it is modified. Responsibility for the matter belongs to the local education authorities under the general oversight of the Department of Education and Science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, North has raised an issue which is of the utmost importance to a small number of individuals. I shall draw the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science to what the hon. Gentleman has said. However, I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minsiter for agreeing to draw the matter to the attention of the Secretary of State for Education and Science. If the Secretary of State was minded to introduce regulation to guarantee that all people would receive the necessary financial support if they were independent to complete their secondary education, that would be a step forward. However, knowing and loving the right hon. Gentleman as we do, I have my doubts that he is about to do that. In fact, it is extremely unlikely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that this was a discretionary matter for the local education authority. In reality, discretion-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1090</span>
ary awards vary from place to place, simply because they are discretionary. There is no rule or mandate to apply. Some local education authorities believe that ensuring that everyone achieves the basic standard of education has a high priority. I hope that all education authorities believe that. Some may take the view that young people should have achieved what they were supposed to achieve before the age of 18, irrespective of the problems that they may have faced. In those cases, the authorities may not give them a discretionary award. Some authorities may decide that it is better to give the money to mature students who wish to return to full-time education. Those are difficult decisions. I have sat on the education authority of a borough council, making decisions about discretionary awards. It is heartbreaking. We had to decide, for example, whether someone could go back as a mature student to complete a degree course when there was a perfectly good reason why he or she did not complete the course before. We had to decide whether it would be better to give that money to someone else doing a second degree which might lead to valuable medical research, or whether it should go to a young person who had not been able to finish school for some reason. We wanted to ensure that everyone could complete some sort of education, but heartbreaking decisions had to be made. It is unfair that local authorities should be put in that position, and it is doubly unfair that they are not given the necessary financial backing to do the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister's words mean that he accepts our argument. He may say that it is not the function of the social security system to fund students beyond their 19th birthday. But that is an arbitrary figure—why not 18, 17, 16 or 21?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great interest to the Minister's argument that the age limits must be consistent. He said that child benfit ceases at 19 years of age, a dependency addition should not be paid beyond 19 and that as someone of 19 has passed the age of majority, he will be independent of his parents. The reason for paying a junior rate of benefit to someone under 25 and not taking account of whether he is living in his own household is that the Government claim that everyone is dependent on his parents until the age of 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend puts the point extremely well. Who is dependent and who is independent, and at what age? The age of independence varies. I discussed that with the Minister of State, Home Office who was concerned that a 25-year-old coming to this country could not live independently. He said that he should be able to. I asked him whether his 25-year-old son lived independently, as I had watched him write a cheque for a large sum to help him out. The age of independence varies because it depends on attitude, relationships and so on. You are shaking your head or nodding in agreement, or perhaps in sympathy, Mr. Winterton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps a bit of both. I look forward to receiving a letter from the Secretary of State for Education and Science to say that he accepts the point that I am making. I hope that he will introduce regulations to

ensure that local education authorities fund 19-year-olds to complete their secondary education and that he will fund the local authorities accordingly. I suspect that that letter might be some time in coming, although I am sure that I shall receive an early acknowledgement of the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the meantime, we could amend the Bill to cover the unfortunate young people who wish to complete their secondary education. If the Secretary of State for Education and Science informs me that he intends to introduce regulations to guarantee secondary education for all people up to and including the age of 19,1 shall support the Secretary of State for Social Security in amending social security law to withdraw part of what might become the Social Security Act 1989. However, it is better to be safe than sorry, so we shall press the amendment now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to add two or three points. First, living in someone else's household does not make a person dependent. Secondly, I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Islington, North ask the Government to limit local authorities' discretion and provide a common set of rules to which they must adhere. Thirdly, I repeat that I realise that there are problems for some 19-year-olds and possibly some 20-year-olds. The amendment would not eliminate all the problems, but those of young people remaining in education after the normal or extended school leaving age of 18 should be dealt with by this Department which will judge educational needs and exercise discretion sensibly. The debate has been useful because it has highlighted a real problem and I shall pass it to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. I am sure that the hon. Member for Islington, North will soon receive a letter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek to limit local authorities' discretion to make payments to 19-year-olds and make them mandatory with appropriate funding. Their discretion would then be what I call the proper area of discretion, which is to decide whether to fund mature students or people doing special courses in adult education, some of which are worth while and some of which are not. Some are of zero benefit to the community. It would be possible to draw up regulations that take account of the education authorities' views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to receiving the letter from the Secretary of State, but I prefer to press the amendment now. He can hassle his right hon. Friend in the Department of Education and Science, who can pick up the burden at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 141, in page 57, line 40, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"18A. In section 33(10) of the 1986 Act, at the end there shall be added the words 'and may take account of any other guidance'."</p></blockquote>
The amendment will remove any doubt as to whether the social fund officers can take account of guidance that they receive from sources other than the Department of Social Security. There has been much argument and many accusations made over the past few months, and I shall come to that shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 33(10) of the Social Security Act 1986 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An officer shall determine any question under this section in accordance with any general directions issued by the Secretary of State and in determining any such question shall take account of any general guidance issued by him."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State's directions and guidance are published in the social fund manual. In addition, the Act provides for general guidance to be issued by area social fund officers and it requires them to take account of that guidance as well. When a social fund officer's decision is reviewed by a social fund inspector, the inspector is also required, by the Act, to take account of guidance issued by the Secretary of State and the area social fund officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 12 December 1988, the National Union of Civil and Public Servants issued a small, but comprehensive document entitled "Supplementary guidance to social fund officers". The document deals with the priorities set out in the social fund manual, including those on local office budgets, monthly profiles, consistency, general guidance, capital, maternity expenses, medical needs, budgeting loans and many other things. Many people found the document useful and it was well-received by social fund officers who found it a helpful addition to the official guidance. However, the document provoked an ill-tempered circular to local office managers from the director of the regional organisation at the Department of Social and Security. He was miffed by the extra guidance even though the officers found it useful and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) muttered in my ear as she sat down, so do we. The director of regional organisation said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is not the function of a trade union to offer guidance to their members in this way and such material has no status…. There is… a statutory basis for the guidance issued by the Department on behalf of the Secretary of State and any attempts by the Union to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1093</span>
persuade SFOs to act otherwise than in accordance with the Secretary of State's guidance could be actionable in law… .The NUCPS circular contains misleading and factually incorrect information. Moreover, it calls upon SFOs to ignore the constraints of the Social Fund budget. It also asks them to ignore the Department's advice to be consistent in their decision making. You should instruct your staff not to follow the advice in the NUCPS circular in any respect."</p></blockquote>
One is tempted to say, "Come back Stalin, all is forgiven." It is a hard-hitting document, but the officers have found it useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The union does not accept that the supplementary guidance is either misleading or factually incorrect, but as the director gave no details of the alleged inaccuracies it is unable to comment on that accusation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The director's circular, on the other hand, is grossly inaccurate. The supplementary guidance does not
	<br><blockquote><p>"call upon SFOs to ignore the constraints of the social fund budget".</p></blockquote>
On the contrary, it specifically says that payments must not exceed the national budget; that SFOs must have regard to the local office budget and take account of the guidance in the manual; that they
	<br><blockquote><p>"will of course endeavour to keep within their annual budgets";</p></blockquote>
that, before the local budget is overspent, the manager should request an increase, as advised in the manual; and that if SFOs consider it necessary to exceed the local office budget they should first raise the matter with their line manager. How anyone could interpret all this as
	<br><blockquote><p>"calling upon SFOs to ignore the constraints of the budget"</p></blockquote>
is a mystery. The most charitable explanation is that the director had not actually read the document he was criticising.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor is it true that the supplementary guidance asks SFOs to ignore the Department's advice to be consistent in their decision making. What it does say is that concern about consistency must not prevent them from making payments that might have been refused, as being of low priority, earlier in the year. In a situation where a substantial part of the money available for community care grants looks like being unspent at the end of the financial year, that must surely be good advice) but, in any case, it is in no way inconsistent with the guidance in the manual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the supplementary guidance differs significantly from the manual in emphasising the distinction between the Secretary of State's directions, which are binding on SFOs, and his general guidance of which they are required to take account but which they need not follow where it seems inappropriate in a particular case. It repeatedly draws attention to parts of the manual which read like directions but which, on closer inspection, turn out to be only guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quickly go through some of the so-called directions. They remind me of the new feature in 	<i>The Guardian</i> about what people did not say, such as the one about Moses who came down from the mountain and said, "These are only guidelines"! I shall give a few examples of the many quoted in the supplementary guidance. Paragraph 4158 of the manual says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Crisis loans may only be awarded for living expenses for more than two weeks in exceptional circumstances."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1094</span>
Anyone reading that would assume that it was an instruction which had to be complied with. In fact, it is only guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6215 says that a clothing grant can be made up to a maximum of £150. The clear implication is that the £150 maximum cannot be exceeded, but that too turns out to be only guidance and not a binding direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6541 says that a grant for reconnection of gas or electricity may be awarded
	<br><blockquote><p>"to families containing a disabled child or a child under 5".</p></blockquote>
the implication being that such grants must not be made in other cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 6461 says that when a relationship has broken down a grant may be awarded to help one member of the couple to move if they have lived together for three months, if there are children, or two years if there are none. In each of those cases, the supplementry guidance makes it clear to SFOs that what is said in the manual is not a binding direction but only guidance which they must take into account but should not follow if it is inappropriate to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 141 does not specifically refer to guidance issued by trade unions or other bodies. It makes the point that SFOs are and must be free to decide for themselves whether to take into account any guidance that becomes available to them from any source other than the Secretary of State or the area SFO. At present, little non-official guidance is available, but over the next year or two a growing body of literature will be produced by responsible outside bodies, of the kind that already exists in relation to social security benefits and that is used by both adjudication officers and appeal tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, tribunal members are supplied with two volumes published by Sweet and Maxwell, setting out the Social Security Acts and regulations with extensive guidance on their intepretation. It has never been suggested that the guidance in these books cannot be taken into account, although there is no statutory authority to do so. Such authority is simply not necessary, any more than a court needs statutory authority to take account of the standard legal textbooks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to quote a few examples that have been sent to me from Sheffield social services. The Association of Directors of Social Services anti-poverty working group, which monitored the social fund, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Examples are coming forward from a number of areas about rigidity of interpreting or using the powers to give assistance under the Fund.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As would be expected a number of these examples relate to Community Care centres where applications for grants have been refused and loans offered instead. Social Services clients who have been refused grants include a mother suffering from quite severe mental illness seeking assistance to set up a new home and a disabled elderly person in receipt of regular home care services asking for a grant for a washing machine. Both these cases appear to be well within the discretionary powers as set out in the guidance.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Other examples of rigidity appear to be more arranged upon the deficiencies of the scheme itself rather than the insensitive or inappropriate use of discretion. This particularly applies to some of the refusals or crisis loans."</p></blockquote>
The following example is given:
	<br><blockquote><p>"One woman who lost a purse was refused a loan on the grounds
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1095</span>
that her husband who was away from home at the time was not available to sign the repayment agreement."</p></blockquote>
We are obviously unhappy bout such examples. If the Minister accepts that amendment No. 141 is unnecessary and that the regional director's circular of 10 January 1989 was an aberration and should be withdrawn, the amendment could also be withdrawn. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When is a guideline a hard and fast rule? The answer is, when it is attached to a cash limit. The problem of the social fund originates in that cash limiting. At that point the money becomes hard money. There is no discretion: there is no soft money with which to use discretion. The guidelines inevitable become rigid. It is useful to have a budget heading that is known to be constantly underspending. It puts slack into the budget and enables other areas to be extended. The limits on the social fund are causing severe problems. Will the social fund be mentioned in the Government's television advertising campaign about what is to be available in the form of social security benefits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall start with the points made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie). I believe that he was arguing less for the amendment, which permits social fund officers to take other guidance into account, than for one which would give other organisations the right to have their guidance communicated to and considered by social fund officers. That is a rather different proposition and I would resist it much more vigorously than I must resist this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman based his case on the NUCPS supplementary guidance that was sent to social fund officers. Management quite rightly felt that it usurped its management functions and reacted strongly, as was shown in the letters and circulars that he read out. It felt—and I support it wholeheartedly—that it is not a proper function of the union to advise staff how to do their job. If the union had points to put, there was an established procedure for doing so. In flouting that well understood convention, the union made good relations much more difficult than they would have otherwise have been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Lady wish to intervene?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put it on the record that I have never heard such pompous rubbish in all my life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is now on the record. What I said is also on the record. I think that the management was quite right to consider that the full and well written guidance that the union sent out to social fund officers without any reference to departmental management was an arrogation of a management function that properly belongs to management. There are avenues for putting genuine union worries to management. The hon. Gentleman said that he was particularly con-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1096</span>
cerned about evidence that some social fund officers were treating guidance as regulations that had to be abided by. Management was already aware of that and has also issued its own observations, as have the social fund inspectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not affect the management's position or what it would say if the matter came up again. It would no doubt be useful in emphasising that management has the right to give its guidance on the guidance issued by the union. That is what it did in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable a social fund officer, when determining any question relating to an application for a social fund payment, to take account of any advice that might be available to him or made available to him, by anyone at all. Under the law as it stands, a social fund officer is bound, in determining any claim, to act in accordance with any general directions issued by the Secretary of State and to take account of any general guidance issued by the Secretary of State. Indeed, the law provides only for guidance issued by the Secretary of State to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the law and the directions, the social fund officer has discretion to decide claims as he thinks right. He must take the Secretary of State's guidance into account but he will also bring to his decision his common sense and his experience of social security, he will also bear in mind the comments and opinions about particular cases and about the way in which the social fund is operated, expressed to him by social workers, the representatives of charitable organisations and the other bodies and individuals with whom social fund officers need to be in regular contact. A growing caucus of articles, booklets and reviews of the operation of the social fund is now being published. I hope that social fund officers will read them and exercise their mature judgment. It will help to inform them about their responsibilities within the law, having taken the Secretary of State's into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend resent—as I do—this constant knocking of social fund officers by Opposition Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, although I think that Opposition Members would say that they are knocking the social fund, not the social fund officers. The officers have made a great success of operating a new type of social security scheme—one with discretion. The social fund is meeting needs that could not be met under the old single payment system, because the officers have the discretion to exercise their own judgment. Naturally it takes time to get used to a new system, but I am impressed with the speed of the officers' adjustment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not knocking the social fund officers, who seem to support our view. When we take up cases on behalf of our constituents, the reply is often that the officers would like to assist but the rules are too rigid.

hon. Gentleman should recognise that. Thre is no restriction on social fund officers as to the advice that they may receive and reflect upon, although they must take the Secretary of State's guidance into account. Having done that, a social fund officer is required to use his judgment as to how to exercise his direction. In that sense, the amendment is redundant. It would merely permit him to do what he is not prevented from doing now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must ask my hon. Friends to resist the amendment, not merely for the negative reason that it is redundant but because it would not be right to elevate any other advice to a standing similar to that of the Secretary of State, who is responsible to Parliament for the Department and the social fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be absurd and unhelpful to accord formal status to advice that might be hostile or supportive, accurate or inaccurate, clear or muddled, foolish or wise, without distinction. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Member for Heeley will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. I agree with the Minister that the reply was negative. If trade unions are mentioned to any Conservative Members, Front or Back Bench, they seem to think of devils and think such people must not have an opinion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course they are entitled to opinions, and there are avenues for expressing them. However, to give a whole programme of management action to social fund officers without reference to the Department is arrogating a management function which even some Opposition Members would agree does not belong to a union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quoted a case where the accusation made by the regional director was inaccurate. Nothing in the supplementary guidelines goes against the manual; in some cases, it has to emphasise and give guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about SFOs who are, no doubt, members of the same union. If the people at the sharp end cannot use the advice of their organisation on how to work these complicated guidelines, we are in a sorry state. No criticism is intended of the officers, certainly not of the trade unions, who are tantamount to being the same people and the same group. However, often such guidelines would be useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Minister has listed ways in which the SFOs can use their discretion; indeed, I was getting excited about that. However, one would think that SFOs throughout the country never need reminding what their powers are and how much discretion they have. The Minister has now put it on record and we shall circulate it to some of our SFOs and tell them not worry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More than once people have ased whether SFOs needs reminding. There is plenty of evidence to show that they do. My right hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East (Mr. Orme) received a letter from the Secretary of State dated 2 February 1989 in which he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do acknowledge that there may have been some overstrict
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1098</span>
adherence to my general guidance in certain cases. My officials have written to local officers on this subject and we are considering changes to the guidance to make it clearer and to stress that the guidance is not to be interpreted as a strict set of instructions as to when help should or should not be given."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State might have had the grace to acknowledge that the National Union of Civil and Public Servants had already drawn those facts to the attention of SFOs two months previously and had received a threatening letter from the regional director for its pains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has not defended or justified the letter sent to the union, nor has he convinced us that everything is fine in the interpretation and implementation of the present guide lines. However, we have been assured that there is flexibility, and, the Minister has listed examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 297, in page 57, line 40, at end insert—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>"Overpayments</i></p>
	<p>18A. In section 53(1) of the 1986 Act, at the end there shall be added the words 'unless the period during which the overpayment occurred ended before the coming into force of this section and in the obtaining and receipt of the benefit the beneficiary, and any person acting for him. throughout used due care and diligence to avoid overpayment'.".</p>
	<p>The Amendment was tabled because of the number of cases to which the Cornwall money advice and welfare information project has drawn over attention. About 200 parents of severly disabled children have been asked to repay attendance allowance that they claimed in good faith between 1979 and 1985.</p>
	<p>Everyone accepts that, in principle, if a person claims benefits to which he is not entitled the Department should have the power to recover the money, although most overpayments are the result not of fraud but of mistakes, misunderstandings or, at the worst, carelessness in failing to report a change of circumstances or not making the tenor of that change sufficiently clear for the Department to realise what had happened. The Social Security Acts lay down rules for deciding whether, in a particular case, the circumstances justify requiring the claimant to repay money.</p>
	<p>Until 1987, there were different rules for supplementary benefit and for other benefits. The supplementary benefit rule was that the Department could recover an overpayment if the person had misrepresented, or failed to disclose, a material fact. Even if that disclosure or misrepresentation was innocent, the Department could choose to use its discretion to forgo repayment.</p>
	<p>For other benefits the rule was completely different. An overpayment could not be recovered if the claimant could show that throughout the period in question he or she had used
	<br><blockquote><p>"due care and diligence to avoid overpayment."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>The payments in question are payments such as the attendance allowance. In the Cornwall case, provided that the parents could show that they had done all that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1099</span>
could reasonably have been expected or them to ensure that they did not receive benefits to which they were not legally entitled, they could not be forced to repay the money.</p>
	<p>In the Cornwall cases there is no argument about the facts. The parents involved were wrongly adivsed of the effect of the attendance allowance regulations and there can be little doubt that they would have satisfied the test. The matter turns on a fairly arcane point—whether someone ceases to be entitled to an attendance allowance when the person for whom the allowance is paid is away from the home for a certain time. The rule is the 28-day rule, whereby if the recipient of the attendance allowances goes into hospital or into a residential home for 28 days his entitlement to that allowance ceases and he must requalify by being back in the home for another 28 days or so.</p>
	<p>The parents in the Cornwall cases were advised, as far back as 1979, that that did not apply to children going from their homes into respite care for a short time and not for as long as four weeks. That advice was incorrect. The period of 28 days is cumulative. Since those severely disabled children were going into respite care for one, two or even three days a week, their entitlement to attendance allowance was speedily exhausted. Substantial sums were received through overpayment. That happened because parents were wrongly advised about the law. No one disputes that the parents and the local social services department were under a complete misapprehension.</p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>However, since all that happened, the Social Security Act 1986 has put the tests for overpayment on all fours for all benefits, so that it is no longer possible to argue lack of due care and diligence as an excuse for an overpayment of attendance allowance. As usual, when the Department has chosen to apply a universal test, it has applied the most stringent one.</p>
	<p>We resisted the change in the rules when the 1986 Act was debated because we recognised that a more stringent test would be applied. It was not realised then, and I did not realise afterwards, that the new rule could operate retrospectively. People who claimed benefit before April 1987, obeyed the law, and conscientiously tried to avoid having to repay benefit because it was incorrectly claimed under the law are now required to repay it because they did not comply with rules that did not exist at that time.</p>
	<p>I understand that, in answer to a written question from the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Taylor) this week, the Minister said that the new role would not be applied retrospectively because it would apply only to decisions made after April 1987. That is chopping logic. Overpayments occurred long before 1987, wrong advice was given and taken and benefits were received long before the change in the law on overpayment was made and even before the intention to change the law was announced.</p>
	<p>The purpose of the amendment is not to make wholesale changes in the law but to establish that due care and diligence could still be used as a defence with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1100</span>
an overpayment that took place before April 1987. An overpayment that took place before that date should have the law as it stood then applied to it and not the law as it stands now. That would not permit a retrospective decisions but would determine that where people stood in law when they received the overpayment is where they should stand now.</p>
	<p>Several parents of severely disabled children are being asked to repay hundreds, and often thousands, of pounds purely because they were ill-advised about the law. When people suggest to me that the Government have made a mistake, I reply that they have not made a mistake, that they knew perfectly well what they were doing and that they chose to take away money from people. This might be a rare instance of when the Government did not intend the law to apply retrospectively. We believe that it should not, and the amendment would make the law fairer than it is now.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the reasons behind the amendment and why the hon. Lady's points are becoming important. Although I understand that, from the hon. Lady's perspective, the legislation might appear to be retrospective, technically it is not retrospective because all decisions made on or after that date have been taken on that test, irrespective of when the payments were made. We could argue about that, but I hope that I can persuade the hon. Lady that this is not the most appropriate time to pursue the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of us would disagree that having two separate tests under the old system—one for lack of due care and diligence and the other for misrepresentation of facts—was confusing. We now have a single test that applies across the board. I do think that anyone wants to return to the previous confusion. The social security commissioners are due to consider a case on this matter. At the same time, and independent of their consideration, we are urgently considering whether it is right in these circumstances to pursue the question of recovery of overpayments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the hon. Lady and I have the seen how these matters have been discussed in the press. I should like further time to consider these cases. I understand that the parents may feel aggrieved and believe that they have been treated less than generously. I shall consider the arguments carefully, but I cannot go further than that this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am still of the view that it is retrospection to reclaim benefits that were paid some years ago, when the law was different. I am confident that no one will ever convince the parents of those children that it is not retrospection to reclaim benefits under the law as it has since become. However, I am encouraged to think that the Minister's observations mean that perhaps that injustice will be remedied. We are prepared on this occasion to give the Minister a little time to deal with the matter, but if the matter is not dealt with before the Bill completes its passage through the House, we may wish to return to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some facts may still be unclear. Before we come to a view, I should like to be sure of the background.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind the Minister's further observation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 323, in page 58, line 11, at end insert—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>"Credits for unemployment</i></p>
	<p>19A. In regulation 9(3) of the Social Security (Credits) Regulations 1975, after sub-paragraph (b) there shall be inserted—</p>
	<p>'or</p>
	<p>(c) would have been such a day if he had not received in respect of that day a payment in lieu of notice or of the remuneration which he would have received for that day had his employment not been terminated,'.".</p>
	<p>The amendment would put right an anomaly in the regulations regarding contribution credits. When someone becomes unemployed and receives pay in lieu of notice, the period coverred by that pay does not count as a period of unemployment for benefit purposes. That means that wages and unemployment benefit are not paid for the same period. As the whole point of pay in lieu of notice is that the person will no longer be in employment, the employer is not liable for national insurance contributions for that period. Unless the individual starts a new job immediately, there is a gap in his or her contribution record which would normally be filled by credits.</p>
	<p>Under the present rules, credits cannot be awarded in those circumstances because, while the regulations provide for credits for weeks of unemployment, the period covered by pay in lieu of notice is not a period of unemployment for national insurance purposes, although it is in practice, and for all other purposes.</p>
	<p>The case which brought the anomaly to light concerned a constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon). Mr. Adam of West Boldon, Tyne and Wear, was made redundant in March 1986 at the age of 58. He received 12 weeks' pay in lieu of notice. In April 1988 he became ill and underwent major surgery, from which he is still recovering. He claimed sickness benefit, but was told that he was not entitled to it because of the gap in his contribution record which resulted from the period when he received pay in lieu of notice.</p>
	<p>That seems entirely incorrect. It is an anomaly in the regulations. If someone is unemployed, his former employer has no liability to pay contributions on his behalf, nor does the state have any liability to place contribution credits. For people like Mr. Adam who have worked a full working life, few things cause more anger and a stronger feeling of injustice than being told that because of a minor anomaly in the law they cannot draw on the contributions that they have paid for many years. It is wrong that such a gap should exist. In Mr. Adam's case it was 12 weeks, but it could be longer. During that time no one is liable to pay contributions. That fact will almost certainly not be drawn to the attention of the individual involved, who is unlikely to realise that the resulting gap in his record will cause difficulties. Only a minor change is needed to rectify the anomaly and that is the purpose of the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reply briefly. We also realise that there is a problem. It is not a universal problem
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1102</span>
because the future entitlements of people whose earnings have been high enough to give them a full year's contributions will not be affected. It will not be simple to find a suitable cure for cases such as that of Mr. Adam. There are operational difficulties, to which we are trying to find a satisfactory and speedy solution. I shall not suggest that the hon. Lady does not press the amendment because when I last suggested that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) pressed it to a vote. The hon. Lady described the problem accurately, but I regret that the cure is not as simple as she suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It would make it a criminal offence where personal information that has been given to the Department in confidence for social security or other purposes is disclosed without lawful authority.

I think that members of the Committee know that, with the repeal of that section, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has made it clear that he intends to legislate on personal information that is held by the Inland Revenue. This is a parallel provision for information that is gathered by my Department for social security purposes. It is an entirely beneficial and proper protection for those who rely on the social security system to ensure that personal information about them is not revealed by those who are employed by the Department.

which is, under the subsection, the Secretary of State or someone authorised by him. It has been suggested to me that that appears to mean that the Secretary of State or one of his officials may authorise the disclosure of any information about anybody, which rather undermines the purpose of the new clause.

	<br><blockquote><p>"51a (i) Any claim for benefit shall be treated as a claim for any other benefit to which a person is entitled and. on receipt of any claim, it shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to send to the peson information about other benefits to which that person or any member of his family may be entitled.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(ii) on request the Secretary of State should advise whether that person or any member of his family is entitled to any other benefit.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>51B. It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State to make arrangements with a view to ensuring that adjudication officers and other officers of his concerned with the administration of this Act exercise their functions in such manner as shall best promote the welfare of persons affected by the exercise of those functions by ensuring maximum take up of benefits to which a person is or may be entitled.".'.—	<i>[Mr. Kirkwood.]</i></p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Brought up, and read the First time.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take my cue, briefly. The new clause gives the Trappist Members on the Conservative Benches a chance to redeem themselves slightly for their lack in seizing opportunities that have been hurled at them day in, day out from the Opposition Benches in order to try to ameliorate the position for claimants. I wish to rehearse some of the arguments behind the new clause, because if we are moving towards getting claimants actively to seek work when they are claiming unemployment benefit, the least that the Government can do is actively promote the maximum take-up of benefits. That is the basis on which the new clause rests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to assess the up-to-date position on take-up, because we are still waiting for the 1985 figures to be released. I understand that they will be published shortly, and they will show what the position was then. Because there is no other evidence available, I shall adduce the evidence of the figures produced for 1983–84. They are instructive and I draw the Committee's attention to two examples of the level of take-up as shown by the Government's own figures. In 1983–84,76 per cent of those eligible for supplementary benefit claimed and that meant that 89 per cent of total expenditure was taken up. Of course, the balance was left unclaimed. The benefit is substantial, £8.40 a week. The figures were given to me by the Child Poverty Action Group—I notice that the Under-Secretary looks panic stricken—and it has a good record in working out such figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other example that I wish to use—I could cite
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1106</span>
more—is that of family income support, which was the system that operated in 1983–84. The figures show that 54 per cent of those eligible claimed and the 65 per cent of the total potential expenditure was taken up. That comes to £7.10 a week left unclaimed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not recollect that during Social Security questions earlier this week it was stated that family credit take-up is now ahead of budget and that the Government are committed to a further campaign in a few weeks time? In the few minutes that remain, he might congratulate the Government on both those counts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I gently suggest to the hon. Gentleman that we are talking about two different things and two different years. I quoted the figures for 1983–84 when the family income support system was in place. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows that the family credit system was introduced by the Social Security Act 1986. I know that attempts are being made to increase the take-up of family credit and I support all efforts made in that direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1983, the last year for which figures are available, the take-up level was 54 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman makes the mistake of listening to the interventions of Conservative Members, he might bear in mind an article that clearly has not been read by the hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall), which suggested that the latest figures show that the take-up of family credit has just gone down again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: History will show how successful the Government have been but the target was originally 60 per cent and I bet a used Scottish pound note—we still have such civilised things north of the border—that when the Government figures eventually appear they show that the level of take-up of family cedit is nothing like 60 per cent. I happily make that rash wager with Conservative Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Burns 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Make it a fiver.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot afford a fiver. I am not a Scot for nothing. I am being provoked, Mr. Winterton, but I am doing my best to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The low levels of the take-up of benefit are worrying. The Government argue that the new structure is simpler. I accept that, but it is not an excuse fo shuffling off the responsibility to take every opportunity to maxi mise take-up. I know that the Government are engaged in a new advertising and information cam paign and I welcome the fact that some £5 million will be deployed in April. But when that is compared to the amount that went into extolling the virtues of "Sid"—some people may regret finding Sid and passing the message to him—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am being provoked from all around. I have missed my 6 o'clock train, so why should I worrry?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I welcome the extra money to be spent on advertising, we must bear it in mind that substantial sums have been deployed by other Departments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1107</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us are still searching for old, hissing Sid, but we have now found a new culprit: the Government are spending £25 million on advertising water. I had hoped that the water service would remain public, but they want to privatise it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the hon. Gentleman aware that, although £5 million is better than nothing, the Government are still penalising local authorities for trying to spend money in that way? That is a serious matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. The resources that are deployed to provide extra information are still inadequate, despite the Government's new plans. Not only are the sums inadequate, but I understand that the Government's priority may be to give information about family credit because it is difficult to increase take-up of that benefit. But other benefits also deserve attention and I hope that the Government will not concentrate all the extra money on trying to promote futher elucidation of entitlement to family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government may say that DSS offices in different areas have different priorities, so it would not be appropriate to have central direction and standard provisions in each integrated local office. However, the Public Accounts Committee found the reverse: it was worried about the different levels of provision, infomation and advice that were made available. In Scotland, the pilot projects and schemes that were undertaken by the Scottish Office and the section of the Department responsible for Scotland show that take-up campaigns can be extremely effective and produce worthwhile results. If the Minister does not have evidence of that work, I shall happily send him my information on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could argue that lack of knowledge is not the whole story and is not a significant cause of low take-up. Again, that is not borne out by evidence. The experience of Government Departments leads to the conclusion that lack of knowledge is clearly a contibutory factor. For all those reasons, the Government have a duty to increase the work that must be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could also say, philosophically, that people are entitled not to take up benefits; they do not have to have benefit cheques stuffed down their throat, and they should be allowed the freedom to choose. But we must ask why people are not claiming benefits to which they are entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one in the Opposition is in favour of fraud. Anyone who commits fraud should be brought to book. However, without wishing to enter deeply into party political arguments, I suggest objectively that the Department places too much emphasis on trying to redress social security fraud. The publicity in the tabloid press and the Government's view that claimants are part of the dependency culture do not help to achieve better take-up levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People whom I should expect to know better are ignorant about how we deploy expenditure figures. The figures for the coming years are based on the best estimate of spending on social security. That takes into account the likely take-up of benefits. The Treasury and the Department do not budget on the basis of a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1108</span>
100 per cent take-up. That puts the argument on a false basis. There are cogent reasons for considering actively and urgently how to maximise the take-up of benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause provides flexibility. The Government should do more to achieve full take-up of benefits. I was interested to read the evidence given by some of the civil servants from the Department when they were questioned by the Public Accounts Committee. A civil servant called Mr. France made it clear that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parliament has not required the state to advise people as to the best way to claim".</p></blockquote>
He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if Parliament required the state to do it then the state would do it."</p></blockquote>
Later in the proceedings, he made it even clearer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If we were required by law to encourage people positively to claim, go out into the highways and byways, then we would do it. but the law does not actually require us to do that."</p></blockquote>
That is a powerful statement of the Department's view and it is up to parliamentarians to pay attention to it. The new clause would redress the balance in favour of claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed new section 51 A(i) would provide that the date of the first claim for a benefit would be treated as the date of a subsequent claim for other benefits. That is straightforward and could not be simpler. If a lone mother claimed child benefit and discovered only subsequently that she was entitled to lone parent benefit, the date of the claim for the lone parent benefit would be the date of the original claim for child benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause would require the Department to send information about other benefits to claimants who may be entitled to them. The National Audit Office's report on quality of service found that targeting of information about supplementary benefit to the unemployed when they signed on worked extremely well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Proposed new section 51A(i) would cover claimants who get severe disablement allowance and who might also be entitled to mobility or attendance allowance or both. The proposed new section 51A(ii) could easily be implemented by sending every claimant a copy of the excellent booklet "Which Benefit?", with which I am sure members of the Committee are familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New section 51A(ii) would also shift the onus of ensuring maximum take-up to staff acting for the Secretary of State and would require them to advise claimants. That is not an attempt to belittle or replace independent advice, because the excellent facilities of the Child Poverty Action Group, the citizens advice bureaux and similar organisations, law centres included, would still be required. Clearly, people no longer look to the Department of Social Security for information and the Department does not provide advice. However, that view may be changing because the Department has issued some statements in the past. It would be helpful if the Minister said whether that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The DSS may say that it will get into legal trouble by
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1109</span>
giving advice because difficulties could flow from any duff advice and people might lose out as a result. However, in the past, the Child Poverty Action Group, the law centres and other independent bureaux have never found giving advice a problem, so it should not trouble the Department. No doubt the Department's insurance premiums are fully paid up. As a solicitor who pays nearly £1,000 a year to obtain professional indemnity, I know that there are ways of obtaining indemnities if they are needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Potential claimants need encouragement and it is legitimate to complain that the Department does not encourage people enough. That function should be carried out by DSS offices. The DSS sends out officers, who are very helpful in my part of the world. They make home visits and perform much valuable work. It could be made more valuable if officers were given a clear, specific, legal remit to take on an advisory role as well as responding to questions about entitlements to individual benefits, whoch, at the moment, claimants must specifically seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the new clause is to make the Department consider taking on that new role. The purpose of new section 51B is to reinstate the old welfare responsibilities in the broad sense, which the Secretary of State formerly had under section 27, I think, of the much loved Supplementary Benefits Act 1976—the old "S" manual with its 16,000 paragraphs of pure poetry. The old "S" manual is much missed. It described the welfare function as including the provision of
	<br><blockquote><p>"a prompt, accurate, courteous and humane maintenance service".</p></blockquote>
That element is largely missing from the new system under the 1986 provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion—[hon. Members: "Ah!"]. The subject is important. I understand the constraints on time, but I hope that the Committee will consider the ideas in the new clause. It aims to ensure that people who actively seek work also benefit from a Department that is actively seeking maximum take-up, and that that is seen in future as an integral part of promoting claimants'welfare.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee, but I wish to put on record the fact that, on numerous occasions, the Opposition have argued that we deplore the removal of the Department's former role as a agency that felt that it had a duty to ensure that people received all the benefits to which they were entitled. We deplore even more the growing tendency to suggest that the rights to which people have contributed are in some way charitable payments, and the Government's tendency to remove those rights and sometimes replace them with charitable payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the view expressed by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that the welfare role that was carried out by the Department at one time should be restored and improved. There is little doubt that the Department has a golden opportunity to do so if it is prepared to put the investment in new technology to good use, and to use the staff released to carry out the welfare role. The new clause that was so ably moved by the hon. Gentleman is welcomed by the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully support the new clause proposed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1110</span>
by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). The Department has a responsibility to inform claimants or potential claimants of the benefits that are available to them. That work is partly done by a number of excellent organisations such as citizens advice bureaux, local authorities, other advice agencies and a number of pressure groups which produce excellent briefing and guidance material. In some senses, they are doing the work that should be done by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Department claims that leaflets are readily available and has advertised that there is a free phone number one can ring if there is a shortage of supplies, the difficulty is finding out what that number is. The lack of information on social security matters is a serious problem. Although I am glad that £5 million is being spent on advertising, it is essential that the Department should be required to make that information readily available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) mentioned the possibility of new technology releasing people to do extra work on promotion and advising, and I support her in that. New technology ought to release people from humdrum jobs, which can easily be done by machine, to improve the personal contact and the local service that the Department offers. I suspect that the Department will not do that but will consider closing inner-city offices, as is proposed in London, and opening offices elsewhere. During the earlier stages of the Bill we discussed the problems caused by the lack of translation facilities. We discussed the need for people to be informed of their rights. I support the clause because it would help to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Half the time the Department and the Government seem to act as though they are doing everyone a favour in having a social security system and paying people. That is not so. It is a right that people have. It is a right for which the rest of the community and people in work pay through taxation. The dissemination of that information is crucial. As I have pointed out many times, translation facilities are needed in my constituency and information needs to be promoted. There is a lack of resources for the local authority and others to do that, and that gap could be filled by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the £5 million but I do not know whether it will be enough. It is much better if the Department is required to make it clear what services and benefits are available and to advise people. If that requirement is not placed upon the Department, this Administration or future Governments could easily not spend that money and not advertise those services. Clearly, it benefits the Government financially not to advertise those services because there is a lower take-up of benefits as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All hon. Members share the concern expressed by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) to see that everyone knows about and claims the benefits to which he or she is entitled. We have had rather more success in that respect than he implied with the figures that he gave. The survey data—I think that it is the same survey that he cited—shows that about £9 out of every £10 entitlement to supplementary benefit was claimed. There will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1111</span>
always be those who choose not to claim, because their entitlement is either for a short period or for a small sum. That is why the amount claimed in expenditure terms always looks healthier than the numbers who may just come into the ambit of a benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Department does all that it can to ensure that no one who has an entitlement fails to claim it through ignorance. Under the much simpler system that we introduced last April, individuals can see clearly what they are entitled to, and it is thus more likely that they will make a successful claim. The take up of disability benefits has increased rapidly in the past few years. I have no doubt that the changes and improvements that we will make when we have studied the OPCS survey reports—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I warn the Minister that people who think that the new system will be a super-duper 100 per cent improvement have to bear in mind that there is an internal take-up problem with the premium. If people do not have the right advice, they may not get the premium to which they are entitled. That does not show up anywhere in take-up of benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The whole system of premiums makes it easier, and more likely, for people to get their full entitlement. That was the thinking behind the matter. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman mentioned it. Part of the exercise was to allow individuals to be passported from one benefit to another, and for premiums to be awarded at key ages. That was the object of the exercise. Entitlement is sometimes overlooked and missed, but it is more difficult to do that now. I do not find many cases of passported benefits not being awarded. I should be interested to know if the hon. Gentleman has any examples of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disability side of the benefit system is complicated and difficult. Although the number of claimants has risen greatly over the past few years, and we have been successful in getting more people to claim, the system needs some changes to make it easier to see what there is to be claimed and therefore easier to claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department offers a system of interchange-ability of benefits, so that the application of one benefit —say, sickness benefit—can also be regarded as an application for an allied one, such as invalidity benefit or severe disablement allowance. The hon. Gentleman mentioned child benefit, and a claim for this may count as one for one parent benefit. A separate claim does not have to be made, as the claim for one can be regarded as a claim for another. It may be possible to extend the system further, although it would not be possible to go further and undertake to tell every claimant—as this new clause would require—about other, disconnected benefits to which they or any member of their family may be entitled. The Department would not have enough information to take on that duty and discharge it effectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be in claimants' interest to create the impression that they could leave it to the Department
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1112</span>
to tell them about claims that they might successfully make. We cannot go beyond the interconnected benefits at this point. If we tried to do so, and lulled claimants into the idea that they would be told that they had an entitlement, the claimants would not benefit and take-up would suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the forseeable future, the onus must be on the claimants to make a claim, though I recognise the Department's obligation to run a comprehensible as well as comprehensive system of benefits, and to make them as widely known as possible. Local offices should readily give advice when asked about possible entitlement, and they seek to do that when asked. Computerisation of the Department, is in its pilot stage and will start to go national in the autumn. It will make possible integrated benefit sections in local offices, and a policy to look after the whole person, rather than the segmented one as at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will make it far easier for staff to advise any person who claims benefit as they will need to know about the whole range of benefits that are available to a greater extent than they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I reading between the lines if I detect a suggestion that, when computerisation and the holistic approach come on stream, it will be possible to advise people that they are entitled to other benefits about which they have not directly asked?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We give that advice now. However, computerisation will enable the staff dealing with a claim to have the claimant's entire benefit record in front of them. They will see the whole picture. Paperwork and filing will largely be a thing of the past and the staff will have a broader knowledge of the whole range of benefits. At the moment, staff need to specialise, but that type of specialisation will no longer be necessary. There will be real gains to staff in being able to give advice on the whole range of benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said. She knows that a reduced number of staff will be needed, but the Government are determined to ensure that the reduction will take place through natural wastage—that will be in the interests of the staff—and that there will be enough staff to perform the proper functions of the office and give advice when the claimants come in.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the greater information that the Minister has given us, but I shall him on two points? First, will the computer file on each claimant contain a summary of the benefits to which the claimant may be entitled? Clearly the file should contain enough information to enable the staff to calculate whether the claimant is entitled to, for example, premiums or other special benefits. Secondly, will the staff be instructed to inform the claimant of all the benefits that he might receive, waiting for the claimant to ask? Even today, many people are reluctant to ask for the benefits to which they are entitled. They may have a vague idea about it, but they are very nervous about asking for it. If the staff have to explain the position to claimants, that will be an important step forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Staff are not able to divine what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1113</span>
additional benefits an individual might be entitled to if they do not have the information about the grounds for qualification in front of them. In future, staff will have a fuller picture of a claimant's record on a VDU screen and the claimant will also be able to see that. Therefore, it is much more likely that the staff will be able to give broader advice. However, I must emphasise that it is up to the claimant to state relevant facts that would not otherwise come to light unless by luck during conservation or by some divination by the member of staff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to come back on this, but is important that I understand the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the claimant would be able to see the VDU screen. That would be ideal, but in reality, many inner-city offices are fortress-like, and I do not think that the staff would be happy at the idea of the claimant sitting down alongside them. There have been too many attacks and too much violence in offices. The atmosphere is such that in many inner-city offices the claimant and the member of staff are not able to sit down together, although new administrative methods may improve the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman, and in our exchanges on inner-city offices, he particularly mentioned the Archway tower offices. Some of the offices in central London are not suitable for the provision of a good service. We expect to move out of those offices and find more suitable premises. Even in the offices that the hon. Gentleman has in mind, it would still be possible to see the monitors through any screens that may be present. The whole-person approach of offices in the future will be well developed and members of staff will make a great effort to understand the needs of individual claimants. However, unless they have been given information to suggest that an individual may be entitled to a particular benefit, they cannot be expected to mention every benefit every time. In the system that we are moving towards, it is more likely that members of staff will be able to give better advice, which is what they want to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) is right to suggest that there is sometimes a shortage of leaflets. We are trying to rectify that. It is not a simple problem of an inadequate number being distributed. Through our offices and the other organisations mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, we are distributing many more than we have in the past. That is part of the exercise, to which the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire referred, of making benefits and entitlements more widely known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1114</span>
Nothing much is to be gained from the requirement in the second part of the proposed new clause to reproduce the welfare provisions in the Supplementary Benefits Act 1980. Declaratory words made sense when quasi-independent bodies such as the Supplementary Benefits Commission and the unemployment assistance board existed. Now that the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament for the whole system, hon. Members are not slow to bring to the attention of Ministers any shortcomings that they find. Repeating words in the Act will not make much difference, although they will take up a few more lines of legislative space.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clause proposes that the Secretary of State should ensure that adjudication officers exercise their functions in a particular manner. It is the function of adjudication officers to ensure that the law and the regulations are applied objectively and fairly. That means, 	<i>inter alia,</i> that claimants will get their full entitlement as adjudged by the adjudication officer. It is not for the Secretary of State to oversee their decisions as they act independently of him. The chief adjudication officer must keep an eye on how they fill their important, but essentially circumscribed, quasi-judicial role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot accept the new clause although I accept the hon. Gentleman's aims and much of what he has said. I also accept the need to make the range of benefits more widely known and to give full and helpful advice to claimants. My hon. Friend the Minister of State shares that view and has been promoting it for longer than I have. The changes that we have in train, such as those emerging from our consideration of the OPCS survey reports, will produce a more rational and comprehensible system. The operational strategy leading to the computerisation of the Department will make strides in the right direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply can be summarised by saying that computers will solve the problem and that we should not expect an answer until the OPCS survey has been produced. We have heard that defence, alas, all too often. I realise that there are difficulties and take some comfort from the Ministers expressions of support for the principle behind the new clause. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdrawn the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Bill, as amended, to be reported.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I am trying to put on a red nose, but I cannot make it stick. In doing that I am not simply putting the Committee in the mood for whatever festivities or relaxation you may have in mind immediately you have said your final "Order, Order" on this Committee, Mr. Winterton, but drawing attention to the fact that we have an opportunity tomorrow to show that in this country we retain our sense of humour and our sense of generosity towards those around the globe who are less fortunate than we are. Perhaps by putting on the red nose I have guaranteed some sort of donation towards Comic Relief day, which is tomorrow. However, I want to make one or two more serious comments, so I shall remove my red nose lest it detract from the sincerity, or be seen to detract from the sincerity, of what I am about to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that Social Security Bills are controversial. There are strong feelings and emotions across the Committee. Therefore, it is immensely important that the conduct of the Chair is firm and concerned with order, but also good humoured. If I may say so, I believe that you, Mr. Winterton, and Mr. McWilliam, Mr. Lofthouse on one appearance and Sir Paul Dean on another, and, occasionally, members of the Committee who stood in for the formal Chairman, have all conducted our affairs within those parameters. We are deeply grateful to you and to all of them for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute also to the learned Clerk—who I am sure has guided you, Mr Winterton, and other members of the Committee as we have proceeded through our business—and I thank him for his work. I thank also the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters, the attendants and the police, who have played their usual unobtrusive but important part in the conduct of our business. I pay tribute to the ever-changing cast of officials from the Department who have advised my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and myself. It has been a complex Bill, and we have had as many officials on duty as we have had hours in Committee. That has been important and valuable for us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay glancing tribute, too, to the principal adviser of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1118</span>
the Opposition who has ensured a very high quality of debate and who has, it would be fair to say, forced my hon. Friend and me back on our stumps from time to time, although at the end of the day we believe that we have carried the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can all be grateful to the usual channels, the two from the Opposition and my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Fallon), who have managed so to arrange our affairs that they have been conducted within relatively civilised hours, as well as to my hon. Friends who have been judicious in their interventions in the debate, but quite extraordinarily effective when they have uttered. I also pay tribute to the Opposition for the spirit in which some very difficult matters have been discussed. I pay particular tribute to the hon. Member for Derby South (Mrs. Beckett) who has, as ever, shown her immense experience in these matters and fought her corner vigorously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On this point of order, Mr. Winterton, I pay special tribute to the Chair as well as to all the others that I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I always think that this is like the litany of the saints. I should like to associate Opposition Members with the Minister's remarks particularly with regard to you, Mr. Winterton, and your colleagues, the learned Clerk and all the officers who helped to man the Committee, the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters, the police, the attendants, and so on. We also associate ourselves particularly with the Minister's remarks about our adviser, who, as we have said before, is a host in himself and enormously valued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am immensly grateful to my hon. Friends for all their help and support. I particularly commend in his absence my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West, (Mr. Flynn) who is across the Atlantic, although he may be on his way back by now. He has only recently succeeded to his present eminence, if I may put it that way, and has given me great help and support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, too, have appreciated the spirit in which the Committee has worked, and the debates have been conducted, although Ministers may not have been able to accept our amendments as frequently as we have felt would have been justified. As I have said, we are especially grateful to you, Mr. Winterton.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. I make these thanks to you, as Chairman, unanimous. More than most, members of my party need the protection of the Chairman, particularly if, like me, they weigh 9 stone 6 lbs. We do not have as many friends around us as the other two major parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay special tribute to the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), particularly as we managed to get through the Committee stage without a guillotine. Social security matters are contentious and it is to the advantage of hon. Members of all parties if we can debate technical and difficult matters without a guillotine. It is thanks largely to the hon. Lady's judgment and the workings of the usual channels that that has been possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can think of no two people whom I would rather
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1119</span>
visited my home and assessed my benefit than the Minister for Social Security and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security. I am sure that there would be no chance of getting shortchanged. I should get everything to which I was entitled. Unfortunately, the Committee has suffered the same thing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In responding to those points of order, I should like to say that from time to time it appeared to me that the only person taking stick was the Chairman of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join with the other members of the Committee who have paid tribute to the officials of the Department, to Tony Lynes, the adviser to the Opposition, and to all those who contributed to what I believe has been a very constructive Committee stage of a controversial but important Bill. That included the 	<i>Hansard</i> reporters, the attendants and the police. I thank, above all, the learned Clerk, John Rose, for his friendship and sound advice. A Chairman could have no better Clerk than John Rose, and I am very grateful to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to say how much I have appreciated the support and assistance of my co-Chairmen, Mr. John McWilliam, Sir Paul Dean and Mr. Geoffrey Lothouse. I thank members of the Committee for their tolerance and forbearance and for their immediate reaction to any request or instruction from the Chair. Above all, I echo one or two of the comments in the points of order and thank hon. Members for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1120</span>
humour of the Committee, which has resulted in a very good debate. The evidence that the House will have before it when it considers the Bill during its remaining stages will be useful and ensure that debates are based on knowledge rather than ignorance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to make a serious point in view of some recent press publicity and the point of order in the House on Tuesday. The Chair's independence is of the utmost importance in the House and in Committee. It must never be called into question, and it is worth making strenuous efforts to uphold it. The Chair must be not only independent but seen to be so. For that reason, my fellow Chairman, Mr. John McWilliam, and I willingly took no part in the selection of amendment No. 295 or of new clause 2, as was made clear on the selection list, and we willingly stood down from the Chair when they were debated. I hope that all members of the Committee will agree that, in that way, we did all that was necessary to maintain the impartiality of the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank all members of the Committee for their co-operation in making this a most enjoyable Committee to chair. I hope that, once we have concluded our business, we can adjourn to the next room to mark the end of the Committee stage in friendship. So often in these Committees, hon. Members gain a knowledge of other colleagues in the House that they did not have before, and that is a valuable exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
