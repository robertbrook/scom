	<div class='title'>UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT: REQUIREMENT TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT ACTIVELY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed [this day]:</i> No. 41, in page 4, line 41, at end insert "or engaging in education or training".—	<i>[Mrs. Beckett.]</i></p>
	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 46, in page 4, line 47, at end insert "or is undertaking a course of education or training which will enhance his ability to obtain employment".</p>
	<p>No. 50, in page 5, line 6, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(ia) circumstances in which a person undertaking voluntary work in the course of a week shall be deemed to be actively seeking employed earner's employment for all or part of that week;".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my reply to the matters raised in this brief debate will not be entirely unhelpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by registering what is essentially a negative point. Unemployment benefit is designed precisely to provide short-term income for those who have lost wages because they are out of work and who seek a return to work. I start with the principle that benefit should not be a means of subsidising study, training or voluntary work. Therefore, it is difficult to accept an argument for exempting the groups mentioned in the amendments from the requirements which will apply to everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) rightly stated that a person is deemed available for work on any day on which he is engaged in providing a service, so long as it is reasonable for him—subject to 24 hours' notice—to take up a job, attend an interview for a job or an interview with the emploment service. "Providing a service" has been interpreted as covering voluntary work as well as caring for a child or a sick or elderly person. That takes us one step further. It is a reasonable concession in relation to the availability rule, but it does not mean that voluntary workers should be exempted completely from the requirement to actively seek work. If such a concept were accepted, it would mean that unemployed voluntary workers were not really seeking a return to full employment and therefore—to revert to my original principle—unemployment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>200</span>
benefit would not be appropriate to their circumstances. However, I accept that the majority of voluntary workers undertake useful work which, in some cases, may even enhance their chances for future paid work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I conclude, I should say that it is commendable that the unemployed should avail themselves of training and education opportunities and perhaps gain qualifications which may help them back to work. An unemployed claimant can receive benefit while he is studying, training or providing a voluntary service—provided that he remains available for work. To qualify at present, he needs to show that his commitment to his voluntary work—except in the 24-hour concession—or to education or training does not prevent him from attending job interviews or taking up immediately any suitable job offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) spoke about the 21-hour rule. I know that I am on dangerous territory, Mr. Winterton, because that rule applies not to unemployment benefit but to income support. We may have an opportunity to discuss that later. But, we have carried through the rule from supplementary benefit into income support, except for the point which the hon. Lady properly made about 16 and 17-year-olds. Therefore, people on income support can still study under the 21-hour rule. However, I see that you are getting restless, Mr. Winterton, so I shall not pursue that subject now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding—I might be wrong—is that although the bulk of those studying for under 21 hours were on supplementary benefit—now income support—those on unemployment benefit were equally entitled to study when in receipt of benefit. However, I see heads shaking. Would someone who was in receipt of unemployment benefit and who was available for work not be allowed to study for up to 21 hours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The test would be whether that person was available for work. If people are prepared to give up their studies immediately, they are judged to be available for work. That, in essence, is my argument on the three categories suggested for exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why someone who is engaged in voluntary work, training or education cannot also fulfil the criteria that I outlined on actively seeking work. I do not see why looking at newspaper vacancies, applying for jobs, investigating the local labour market and actively seeking work cannot go hand in glove with the three activities that I mentioned. After all, they do not go on 18 hours a day. They will take up only limited parts of the day and other hours can be spent actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make my next point tentatively. If someone is pursuing a course of education or training or even voluntary work that is interpreted as helping that person to seek work—it would be a matter for judgment and eventually for adjucation—it might in some circumstances be taken into account and enhance the other steps that that person was taking in actively seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>201</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give an undertaking that the regulations will deal specifically with people who are studying while on benefit? As Restart has been tightened, people studying for 21 hours have found themselves more and more pressurised to go into schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ask the hon. Lady not to press me for an undertaking now. I advanced the idea tentatively. I wish to consider whether it will be better put in regulations or in guidance from the chief adjudication officer, but I sympathetic to the argument. Perhaps not all forms of study would be judged as enhancing someone's ability to return to the job market, but I shall look sympathetically at ways in which that consideration can be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the position on Equity, which represents 41,000 professional performers who are vigorously looking for work all over the country and in Europe?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am familiar with the Equity case although I am not sure whether it arises under this amendment, Mr. Winterton, or under another amendment. I have seen Mr. Plouviez's submission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are actively seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But they are not in education or training or doing voluntary work, so I may get into trouble if I seek to address the question under this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) that the Minister is right. It is inappropriate to refer to the matter under this group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In essence, people can be engaged in these activies and still seeking work and, in certain circumstances, these activies might conceivably be judged as helping them in actively seeking work. I hope that the Opposition will not press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are genuinely grateful for the Minister's assurances, so far as they go, and we look forward to more detail when he has had time to consider the idea and the best way of implementing it. However, the Minister's case that people on benefits should not seek to be trained or educated is smashed to bits by the structure of the employment training scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thrust of the Government's provision for training for unemployed people, targeted in particular at the long-term unemployed, is to encourage them to take up employment training which pays them on the basis of benefit plus provision. They are working and training because they receive benefit and they get £10 in addition to cover the expense of getting to work. Our benefit system has shifted significantly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Prior to the launch of employment training, schemes had grown by stealth. There had been intelligent use of resources and much application and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>202</span>
effort, and unemployed people who found themselves unskilled and outside the labour market struggled to be able to study to enhance their abilities and qualifications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Stories from my constituency show admirable dedication. A project there is funded under the opportunity for volunteering provisions. The Government intend that it should actively encourage people to volunteer because it helps to bring back confidence and provides contact with others and a chance to get back to work. Such schemes need to be secure in order to encourage people to enter and take courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many young black people enrolled in the scheme and there were special provisions for young black women. I recall that four young black women with small children participated in the scheme and did short informal courses. They went on to Handsworth technical college and did further courses for a year or so under the 21-hour provision and eventually obtained a qualification in social work. They are now superb social workers because people who have experienced the difficulties of a hard life tend to make better social workers than those from more privileged backgrounds. It was a superb effort. The flexibility of the 21-hour rule enabled people to enhance their opportunities for employment skills, talents and education. The Government did not publicise the schemes sufficiently and did not encourage people to enrol. We know that people without skills are much more likely to be unemployed and have greater difficulty finding work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Government have opted for employment training, aiming at a massive 600,000 people a year and basing their proposals on benefit plus for people who go into workplaces to work and train, they should consider the possibility of applying equal treatment to people who are living on benefits and studying. I am talking not of malingerers but of those who take serious courses with the aim of obtaining a qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conditions vary in local offices. Some think that people who take a course that has a qualification at the end—O-level or City and Guilds examinations —are not available for work because they aim to obtain that qualification. Others are more generous, saying, "As long as you apply for any job if we draw a suitable vacancy to your attention, you may go on." This provision is seriously threatened by clause 7. The phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"actively seeking… employment in any week"</p></blockquote>
could easily be interpreted—unless the Government provide otherwise—as making it impossible for someone to attempt a course of study of, say, a year's duration which might lead to a qualification. There is already evidence that tightening up under restart is leading to courses of under 21 hours being called into question and people being forced into much lower qualification under an employment training scheme, or forced into a job club, when they were attending a college and might have obtained a City and Guilds qualification or something similar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the Minister's undertaking but I must ask him to re-examine his reasoning that people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>203</span>
receiving benefits should not consider studying. Employment training is now based upon training whilst on benefits. Many courses in local colleges are of a much higher level than those provided by employment training. People who wish to take up the 21-hours option should be treated as being as worthy as those who accept places on an employment training scheme. I ask the Minister to consider those facts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we genuinely want a non-dependency culture, we should encourage people who are receiving benefits to study and to become educated to enhance their life opportunities and opportunities for employment. It is an important option. It is difficult to obtain national figures of how many people are taking it up. The best estimate that I have seen is approximately 100,000. I know that the figure for under 18 year-olds was 30,000 but that option has been ruled out, which is disgraceful. In some part of the country, the provision is more developed than in others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier, in my local college, which is in an area of much poverty with a registered male unemployment level of 30 per cent., three-quarters of the students are studying under these provisions. If the Government do not make careful provision, they will wipe out serious education, training and life opportunities for people who receive benefits, do not want to receive them but want to enhance their training and educational opportunities to work and contribute to society. Will the Minister look more generously at this possibility?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In essence, the change from available for work and seeking work does not affect this judgment. Previously, people in these circumstances would have to be available for work and therefore willing to give up their courses, voluntary work and so on at short notice to take up a job offer or go for a job interview. I am saying that people can pursue those activities while actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ladywood makes a serious point. I am not as familiar with this as the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) with her previous ministerial experience, but there are various schemes within the education system for mature students to retrain and perhaps to follow routes other than reliance on unemployment benefit for support. Clearly, unemployment benefit is, and has been, a benefit pending a return to work and to qualify a person must be ready to go back to work quickly. Nothing has really changed about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps there are other avenues to be explored, and I hope that the training opportunities available to unemployed people will not be limited to employment training but will encapsulate other opportunities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that there ought to be other means of support. There probably are, but because those other means of support have been so reduced by the Government, this usage has grown up. The vast
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>204</span>
majority of part-time students who draw unemployment benefit on some days and not on others and who come under the 21-hour rule or draw income support, would probably, in a happier age, be drawing a discretionary grant from their local authorities. Thanks to ratecapping, reductions in the rate support grant and the whole panoply of legislation that has flowed from the Department of the Environment in recent years, fewer students have the opportunity to pursue what were once perfectly acceptable courses because support is not mandatory and few authorities give much in the way of discretionary grants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision has grown up to fill a hole in support for students. I wholeheartedly endorse the proposition that people who study ought not to have to draw benefit. If better provision were made available to support students in their studies, that would not be the case. However, we are faced with the position where people who would like to study are not able to obtain grants, or work, and have to do the best they can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that benefit purists tend to take that view—I do not abuse that—but the provision for discretionary grants, outside of compulsory grants, has always been patchy and varied between areas and has depended on the local authority saying that someone is an OK person and can have a grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My preference is for a universal entitlement to study if a person is receiving benefits. We would then have a non-dependency benefit system and open access to education. That is a better approach and goes beyond anything that my hon. Friend the Member could put forward today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand my hon. Friend's point. My own preference is for an extension to the system of mandatory grants, not for an extension to a provision to enable people to study on benefits because that is always questionable and lays people open to the charge that if they are students, the DES should pick up the tab, and not the Department of Social Security. That is my preference, which is widely shared, and I am sure that my hon. Friend will not dissent. The best option is an extension of grants for a wider range of courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. GEOFFREY LOFTHOUSE 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>The Minister said that the point about people engaged in voluntary work was frightfully good, as was the point about people engaged in some form of part-time education, whether under the 21-hour rule or elsewhere. I realise we are in a bit of a hole on this and so I shall say that the law as framed will not make any difference. What the Minister said did not give us as much comfort as it seemed, uncharacteristically, to give my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). In this context at least, it is not the Minister's intentions that I doubt, but his ability to carry them out in the context of the Bill.</p>
	<p>I am strengthened in my wariness and concern by the way in which availability now works. I am sure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>205</span>
that my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood and other Committee Members will have experienced some of the problems that arise under the existing system. Whatever the Minister may say about flexible judgments, and other soothing words, harsh judgments can be made precisely by the exercise of the subjective judgment of the adjudication officer to whose experience, expertise and so on the Minister referred this morning.</p>
	<p>I am strongly reminded of two cases I dealt with in my constituency. A simple query arose about whether a woman following a course was truly available for work, which resulted in her losing most of her benefit entitlement for many months while she waited for her appeal to be heard. I emphasise this point because it is important to keep returning to it. The question was not simply about her being offered a job, but whether, if a job came along—there had been no sign of one for two years or so—would she be available?</p>
	<p>The second case is more disturbing in the context of the Minister's remarks. A young man who was one of the long-term unemployed did not set out to study while he was unemployed—he tried to find work. He was unsuccessful, as so many other people have been in recent years. Because that young man was unemployed and reluctant simply to continue looking for work when there was no prospect of him getting any, he tried to improve his employment chances by studying. He became more and more involved and went further into the education system. He did so legally and in the framework of continuing to be available for work. Indeed, he continued to look for work and emphasised that point to me. He was anxious to find work and was angry when it was suggested that he was continuing to look for work when work was not there for him. That young man finally got to the stage, when I saw him, in February or March where he was about to take his A-levels. He had shown sufficient initiative to obtain a place at university if his A-level results were good enough in the autumn and he was looking forward with enormous joy, excitement and relief to the prospect of no longer being long-term unemployed, obtaining qualifications that would ultimately lead him back into work and ceasing to be part of the dependency culture, which the Secretary of State dislikes so much.</p>
	<p>At this point that young man was called in for a restart interview. His availability for work was discussed and he said he was available and continuing to look for work. He had to concede that there might be a couple of days in June when he hoped he would not be called for a job—one was not on offer—because he was taking his A-levels on those days. If he got his A-levels he hoped that it would be goodbye to the DHSS for ever. Because he was frank enough to tell the restart interviewer that he hoped that he would not be called for a job—at least on those few days, although he was available most days—his benefit was called into question. In fact, we succeeded in maintaining payment of his benefit because most of the time he was available for work and looking for work, had made the most of the opportunities that had come his way, and had pursued a course of study
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>206</span>
which he hoped would benefit him and society as a whole.</p>
	<p>That is what happens when there is an unsympathetic or unthinking interpretation of the law—and that is even before we come to the question of whether or not a person has actively to be seeking work every week. The Minister said that he hoped that officers would be sympathetic enough not to disallow benefit just because someone who had been looking for work for five weeks, for some reason was not looking for work in the sixth week. However, he made it fairly plain that it was wrong for that person not to be looking for work in the sixth week. He said that activity was expected every week, no matter how hopeless it had proved in the preceding weeks and months. It is a classic example of the law not saying what the Minister implies that it might be twisted to say. Surely the purpose of changing the law is to make it more difficult for people to spend their time on things other than actively seeking work.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, because I know of cases that have been treated equally harshly. However, I am optimistic that, because of the undertaking that the Minister has given to consider some form of regulations or advice, things will improve and instead of patchy treatment, we can expect proper treatment of people in all parts of the country who are genuinely studying. Perhaps I am too optimistic, but an improvement may result from that undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Experience suggests that my hon. Friend is too optimistic, but I am always willing to be pleasantly surprised, and I shall be delighted if that happens. I hope that the Minister will introduce regulations to put the matter on a better footing, with discretion used less harshly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that it would be nice if the study being undertaken could be interpreted as helping people in their active search for work. However, the law does not say that, nor will it say that. I should be delighted if the regulations said that, but I somehow doubt it. The Minister is saying, "We have a very good case, but let's keep our fingers crossed and hope that the law will allow this useful provision, whether in relation to voluntary work or study, to continue." I hope that we have drawn from the Minister something which can be regarded as an assurance, especially on voluntary work and provisions for study, and which can be written into regulations. Perhaps we can have draft regulations to show what will happen, along with some idea of the guidance that the chief adjudication officer may give. But, as things are, we are no further forward in our pursuit of reassurances that will stand up, and I have learnt from experience that quoting what the Minister says in Committee butters no parsnips.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The test on "actively seeking employment" would apply only if the claimant had been notified of any suitable job vacancy by the jobcentre in the previous seven days. If the system is to be fair, the burden of proof should fall not just on the claimant but on the jobcentre and the adjudication officer as well. If an officer feels that there is not enough proof that a claimant has been actively seeking work, he has the power and responsibility to take away the meagre benefit from the claimant and his family, he should produce evidence and send the claimant on a job vacancy search, knowing that there is a vacancy. The onus should not just be on the claimant to prove that he has been all over the place looking for but failing to find a job. There should be an onus on the adjudication officer also. For the claimant to have to do that every week in which he is claiming benefit is most unfair and can be costly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Telephone calls are expensive, and I am not sure how one can prove that one has picked up a phone every day or every week to ask companies whether they have a vacancy. Travelling around looking for jobs that are not there costs money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that the test is fair, because it is incapable of being administered in a fair and proper manner that will benefit the claimant. That is why we want some form of safeguard, taking the burden
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>208</span>
of proof away from the claimant and putting it back on to the adjudication officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is costly to travel around looking for jobs that are few and far between, and the benefits that accrue to claimants are hardly generous. They do not provide claimants with a decent standard of living or allow them to go to the theatre or cinema. Claimants can just about look after the family, but their standard of living is low, and there is little left for any other activity, including going out to look for jobs, telephoning for jobs, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Transport costs have increased considerably over the past few years. I have a constituency office in the middle of Sheffield, and people come to see me there for all sorts of reasons—not just about jobs or benefits. Since the deregulation of buses, the cost of travel has increased greatly, and people now find it more difficult to come to my office because of the increased bus fares. As a result, I go to their homes or their area to get the information that I need. Since deregulation, bus fares in Sheffield have gone up no less than 700 per cent. I only wish that benefits had increased by 700 per cent, to match the extra travelling costs that are involved in looking for jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would not prevent the Government from introducing the test in any shape or form, but they would shift part of the burden of proof from the claimant back to the adjudicating officer, who would have to show that a claimant had been told of at least one suitable vacancy within the past seven days. It would be unfair to say, "We don't know whether there are any vacancies. It's up to you to try and find them and to prove that you've applied for them and that you haven't got one." People who are out of work and living on the meagre benefits system are under enough pressure without the extra burden of having to prove that they are actively looking for work when jobcentres are not or do not want to be responsible for monitoring the job market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would make the test a little more fair. They are only a modest proposal. They would not mean that claimants did not have to look for jobs but that, in the first instance, jobcentres would know whether there were any vacancies and would be obliged to advise claimants of at least one a week. The test of whether a claimant was looking for a job could still be applied, but responsibility would be shared. A claimant who is frustrated at not finding a vacancy will at least be understood by the officers interviewing him. They, too, will have to look round for vacancies. They will know whether the job market is good or bad, so they will have a better understanding when they have to decide whether someone is swinging the lead or is genuinely having difficulty in finding work and in proving that he has been actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our proposal has two sides. Officers will understand claimants' frustrations and dilemmas, and claimants will know that officers are au fait with the job market and, we hope, there will be less aggro. If a claimant cannot find a vacancy, the officers will have to prove that they have found one and send him or her to apply for it. Otherwise there should be no repercussions. It is difficult for people to prove
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>209</span>
that they are looking for work, especially in areas where there are few vacancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendments, especially amendment No. 34, if officers dealing with a claimant could not find any vacancies they could not penalise him for not being able to find a job or for being unable to prove that he could not find a vacancy. Without such a provision, the test would be not just unfair but unjust and would cause all sorts of aggro. It would be an example of the faceless bureaucracy that does not understand what is happening in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would make officers understand what it is like to look for work in areas of high unemployment, where there may be job advertisements all over the place, but not suitable vacancies. Officers will never understand that unless they have to produce one suitable vacancy to each claimant every seven days. Then they will share the burden and the responsibilities and will understand what it is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Minister will say that the amendments, especially amendment No. 34, would render the test ineffective because most job vacancies are not notified to jobcentres. That is a fair argument. We are frequently aware of what his responses will be, although we are often unhappy with them, but this one at least we understand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will say that amendment No. 34 will make the test ineffective. In anticipation that our amendments will be accepted, we have tabled amendment No. 47, under which employers would be obliged to notify jobcentres of vacancies, which is a good idea. If employers are prepared to advertise in the local and national press, to inform the jobcentre of a vacancy will involve them in only a little more work. Surely the Government will jump at the amendment, which might prove that jobs were available and that claimants were not prepared to take them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should accept amendments Nos. 34 and 35. If they do I, with great integrity, will personally guarantee that we shall vote for amendment No. 47 to ensure that the other two amendments run smoothly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will consider the amendments seriously. They would not make radical changes or destroy the Bill, but would make it easier to operate for both claimants and officers. It would stop the aggro that is likely to arise when an officer is accused of not understanding the job market or
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>210</span>
when an officer thinks that a claimant is not doing his best to find work. Under the amendments the test would at least be fair, although we do not agree with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 47 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any employer who advertises an employment vacancy or notifies an employment agency of such a vacancy shall, on the same day, notify a prescribed local centre of that vacancy if he has not already done so and shall inform that centre when the vacancy is filled".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this amendment and others linked to it is to ensure that all live vacancies are notified to jobcentres. It is the other half of the Government's proposal. A great many vacancies are filled swiftly by word of mouth and we are not concerned with them, but all other job chances should be made accessible to the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few long-term unemployed people get the chance to apply for most jobs. The overwhelming majority of vacancies—91 per cent.—are filled by job changers. Failure to appreciate that fact seems to have distorted much of the Government's thinking. Most vacancies are filled by people moving from one job to another and the number of vacancies filled by unemployed people is as low as 2 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that the Government intend to force the jobless into a constant active search for work, even in areas of high unemployment, it is sensible to insist that all vacancies are made known to jobcentres. The other side of compelling the unemployed to search relentlessly for jobs is to ensure that firms publicise job opportunities to those in greatest need of a job start.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the system started there has always been a case for compulsory notification of vacancies to jobcentres, but no Government have taken the step. The reintroduction of the genuinely seeking work test greatly strengthens the case for compulsory notification, which would in turn weaken the case for a genuinely seeking work test. The two hang together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 amounts to an admission that the employment system has not operated effectively for many years. The Beveridge report, that great beacon of sense, reason and authority so well read by the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham), who quoted from it on Second Reading envisaged a system in which labour exchanges fulfilled a role that they never have fulfilled. He wrote in 1930, just after the abolition of the genuinely seeking work test:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In so far as this condition"—</p></blockquote>
that is the genuinely seeking work test condition—
	<br><blockquote><p>"has been held to require that to keep in benefit a workman must not simply register at an Exchange for work, but put up some kind of show at least of looking for work in person by going round the factory gates, it marks a complete break with the policies (ie the Labour Exchange Act) of 1909. In them and in the [unemployment insurance] schemes of 1911, Labour Exchanges and unemployment insurance went together as two halves of a single programme.</p></blockquote>
The exchanges were set up to abolish the demeaning and wasteful process of workers hawking their labour from one employer to another.

<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>211</span>
5.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expectation was that setting up labour exchanges would reduce unemployment to a minimum by a streamlined method because employees would have an instant point of contact with employers which would lead to recruitment. Insurance was to maintain the few men and women it was believed that there would be in rare intervals of unemployment. It was believed that before long, so much marketing of labour would be done through exchanges that any test of the reality of unemployment and the need for benefit would be unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exchanges would have been doing their job supplying work and little benefit would need to be paid. If every vacancy were notified to an exchange as soon as it arose, it would be impossible for any workman to draw benefit for even a day after suitable employment was available. The unemployment fund would be completely protected in that way. Until the exchanges reached that development, in Beveridge's view it was better to take the risk of the occasional loss of funds by a few idle workmen than to drive all workmen on the fruitless journeys so familiar in that decade and to perpetuate the disorganisation of the labour market. The genuinely seeking work condition implied; an admission, that the exchanges did not control the labour market sufficiently for the purpose of testing unemployment, that they would never do so and that the hawking of labour, so emphatically condemned by the Poor Law Commission, should continue indefinitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1930, Beveridge expressed the fervent hope—It was repeated this morning by Alan Deakin, author of the book "In Search of the Scrounger" published 12 years ago—that the rule would
	<br><blockquote><p>"not ever rise from its dishonoured grave".</p></blockquote>
Beveridge did not repeat those arguments in his 1942 report on Social Insurance and Allied Services because it was not thought possible that any Government would consider bringing back a rule that was so discredited. He wrote then:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The only satisfactory test of unemployment is an offer of work".</p></blockquote>
Since then, things have moved in the direction opposite to that envisaged by Beveridge. One of the three underlying assumptions of his report was the maintenance of full employment. The Minister spoke about levels of employment and unemployment. We do not accept that the levels can be compared with those of 1979 because of the difference in the way that the figures are counted. The so-called refinements of the unemployed figures since then—there have been 22—have been designed to reduce the total number of claimants without necessarily creating jobs and have destroyed the possibility of achieving, an accurate measure of unemployment. In giving the new figure, which is scarcely understandable because of the routine distortions and fiddles which have been introduced, the Government should also quote the figure based on constant counting methods which were used in 1979. On that basis, unemployment is indeed going down: three months ago it fell below 3 million for the first time. Our judgment will be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>212</span>
distorted unless we realise that there is that mammoth total of unemployed. The Government do not help their case by insisting that their figures are an accurate representation of unemployment as it was measured in the previous decade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this Government, the assumption of permanent mass unemployment has been accepted. They do not have to worry about the 3 million because that figure can be fiddled away until it is at an acceptable level. It would have seemed incredible in the 1970s that 2 million unemployed could be described as acceptable. The Government are still pushing the myth that such a level of unemployment is OK and that the problem is fast disappearing. It is nothing of the sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The thinking behind that view might have been confirmed by the Rainer Scrutiny Report, "Payment of benefits to Unemployed People", published in 1980. That report led to the abolition of the requirement to register at an unemployment exchange or job centre. It stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Given the fact that only a minority of the few available jobs were being notified to the Jobcentres, registration has become a meaningless ritual."—</p></blockquote>
Are we now saying that registration of jobs at a jobcentre is a "meaningless ritual" but that everyone must carry out a search for jobs that possibly do not exist? Compulsory notification of vacancies would change all that. It would create an effective employment service and at the same time an effective means of testing availability for work. It may be the perfect scheme for testing the availability for work. The Minister may argue that such a change should be made by employment rather than social security legislation and if so, the Employment Bill offers a suitable opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 47 does not require that every job vacancy should be notified to the jobcentre because we are aware of the rapid way in which many jobs are filled and therefore vacancies remain for only a short time. There is no point in insisting that vacancies taken by friends or relatives of the employer and advertised only by word of mouth should be notified. The amendment would require notification only when an employer was already taking steps to advertise the vacancy or to seek applications for it through a private employment agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence from surveys, including those carried out in London where there are many private employment agencies, is that few unemployed people use such agencies. They are organised to concentrate on those changing jobs rather than on the unemployed. It is reasonable and fair that if a vacancy is advertised at a private employment agency, it is also advertised through a jobcentre. The employer would have only to notify the jobcentre simultaneously, a relatively simple, straightforward operation which would cost little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment refers to a "prescribed local centre", leaving open the question of whether job centres in their present form, or another in future, should be used for this purpose. The essential principle is that anyone seeking employment should have access to the full range of suitable job vacancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

On Second Reading, the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East commented to my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) that if she had looked further in the Beveridge report—one of the great problems with Beveridge is that he wrote so much and lived so long that we hope we are talking of the same report—
	<br><blockquote><p>"she would have seen that Beveridge suggested that 13 weeks was the longest period in which people should withdraw benefit before compulsorily attending a training centre."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Did not Beveridge say that the danger of providing benefits, which are both adequate in amount and indefinite in duration, was that men, being creatures who adapt themselves to circumstances, may settle down to them?"—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 10 January 1989; Vol. 144, c. 725.]</p></blockquote>
I have a long quotation which I shall not burden the Committee by reading. We do not agree that that is what Beveridge meant in his report "Social Insurance and Allied Services". Beveridge made those comments in the context of a proposal to pay unemployment benefit at subsistence level without a means test and without any limit of duration. None of those recommendations was adopted. Beveridge proposed attendance at work or at a training centre as a condition after six months, not 13 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His comment was made in the context of the assumption that full employment would be maintained. His assumption was always that employment would become a permanent state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He wrote that a provision for cash benefits was
	<br><blockquote><p>"impracticable if it has to be applied to men by the million or hundred thousand."</p></blockquote>
The work or training condition therefore has no relevance to present conditions and, in conditions to which it was relevant, Beveridge would have wanted unemployment benefit to be paid without limits of duration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 61 to section 17 of the 1975 Act would require a claimant to show that he is "actively seeking employment". Clause 7(2) is more specific. It requires the claimant to be "actively seeking such employment" which, in the context of the Clause means "employed earner's employment." As "an employed earner" for this purpose means someone who is neither employed under a contract of service nor pays income tax under schedule E, it does not include someone who is self-employed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to enable a person who is actively seeking self employment to satisfy the "actively seeking employment" test. The use of the term "employed earner's employment" in the availability conditions is entirely reasonable. It simply means that a person who is drawing benefit cannot stipulate that he will work only on a self-employed basis, which would obviously be an unreasonable restriction on his availability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 7 creates an entirely different situation. The Government now say that, to qualify for unemployment benefit, a person must be both available for employment as an employed earner and actively seeking employment. The Opposition oppose that additional condition. If the Government
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>214</span>
cannot be persuaded to drop it, we can see no reason why a person who is actively seeking to become self employed should not be regarded as satisfying the "seeking employment" test. Increasingly, many unemployed people are looking at the possibility of going it alone and setting up as a one-person business on a self-employed basis. They often have Government encouragement and, in some instances, the benefit of enterprise allowances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a person has a realistic prospect of setting up in business and is actively pursuing that aim, why should he be expected to pursue, at the same time, other perhaps far less hopeful alternatives because of the Government's obsession with frenetic activity to seek work that perhaps does not exist? Is it fair on employers to compel people to apply for jobs which—if they get them—they will want to relinquish after a short time when their plans for self-employment materialise? Under the amendment, a claimant would have to be available for the employment and actively seeking either employed earner's employment or self-employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 62 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any employer notifying a prescribed local centre of an employment vacancy for the purpose of subsection (2A) above shall at the same time provide a written undertaking not to discriminate against any person that is older than another person or persons or on the grounds of the duration of his current or past spell or spells of unemployment".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is important. It ties in with a point that was made in an intervention this morning, when we heard about the new crusade that the Government have discovered, especially for workers over 60. There has been an explosion of enthusiasm for what seems to be a good cause, although the need for a decade of retirement and the necessity of finding fruitful work for elderly people have been around, and been discussed, for some time. However, there is serious difficulty for, and considerable discrimination against, the long-term unemployed, especially those in the older age groups. That is apparent on the jobs market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper "Employment for the 1990s" acknowledges that employers seem reluctant to recruit the unemployed but does not emphasise sufficiently the extent of the discrimination. Clearly there is discrimination. Our view on that is reinforced by the figures and the evidence of job advertisers, who point out that workers will not be considered unless they can produce recent references and proof that they have become unemployed recently. It is not simply a matter of job search activity by individuals. The labour market is highly fragmented and often discriminatory in many ways. The older unemployed and the long-term unemployed have limited strategies and choices for jobs. It seems right that that should be taken into account in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that unemployed people must show that they have tried to find work. Again, we return to the question of judgment. What will people have to do to prove that they are trying? Will it be decided that it is good for their morale for them to seek jobs that they know do not exist? Does it make
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>215</span>
sense to tell the same people each week that there are no vacancies for them on this meaningless merry-go-round? Do employers realise that the same people will apply week after week? Will staff of jobcentres say to people, "There are no vacancies at that firm, but you should go there because that is the only way that you can show that you are actively seeking work"? It cannot be in the interests of claimants or anyone else to follow that futile ritual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said this morning that there was a punitive motivation behind the idea—that people were being punished for being unemployed. It goes back to the view that unemployment is created by the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not feel that the proposal will catch anyone who works and signs. How on earth can it? Someone who evades detection can easily produce bogus evidence in future. The Minister's description this morning suggests that it will be possible for the skilled, plausible evader to continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision gives the official a new power to make a decision—again, on a subjective basis. Having weighed the evidence, or lack of it—perhaps imperfect evidence or evidence that is not routinely checked—he can then say to a person, whom he may dislike for all kinds of reasons, "You are not actively seeking work. You failed to prove to me that you are doing so and I disallow your claim."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the process involves an assessment of the claimant's personal qualities. How can it be any other way? It brings us back to precisely the same problem that has been encountered time and again in the past—a judgment has to be made on the state of mind of the person seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

His proposal would narrow the meaning of the clause so that only someone who does not follow up a vacancy of which he has been notified can be disentitled to benefit, but the objective of the clause is to require the claimant actively to seek work. I accept that a claimant's unwillingness to follow up a suitable vacancy of which he has been notified is one test of his willingness to take a job, but it is not a test of whether he is doing all that he reasonably can to find one, which is the object of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe—and it was argued extensively this morning and during the previous sitting—that claimants should be required to use their own positive efforts and initiative in their search for jobs. That the overwhelming majority do so is common ground between the two sides of the Committee, although the Opposition suggested that that was not true of those on the Conservative Benches. Of course, there is argument because no one knows exactly how large a proportion that minority is, but we believe that the minority should be under an obligation to do what most unemployed people do on their own initiative—to take thought and action themselves to find openings to get back into employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There appears to be no difference between the two sides of the Committee on the belief that the unemployed should actively seek work in whatever way they can. But the Opposition believe that it is wrong to deprive people of their money when there is no chance of their getting a job. It should be a condition that the public employment agencies make them an offer of a job before they are deprived of their money. That is the difference between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference between us is the Government's belief that people should actively look for work. There is no difference between us in the belief that, if there is no work to be found, no one should be deprived of his entitlement to unemployment benefit or income support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wrong. He said that there is no difference between us in the belief that, if jobs exist, people should seek them. But the clause and the Bill will apply irrespective of whether jobs exist. That is the major difference between us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that both sides of the Committee agree that no one should be deprived of benefit if there are no jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wrong about his Bill. It suggests, in effect, that people should be deprived of their benefit if they will not seek work. But the new test does not take into consideration whether the search for work is likely to be productive or whether there are any jobs. The Minister misleads the Committee; the Bill relates to someone actively seeking work, not to whether there is a realistic chance of finding it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That consists of taking appropriate steps. If there are no jobs and the local jobcentre knows that to be so, the claimant cannot be expected to take appropriate steps—they are not there to be taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does that mean that the Minister accepts amendment No. 47? If the jobcentres are to know that there are no jobs, surely all job vacancies must be reported to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, we shall come to that amendment. But, alas, it is not one that I can accept. I understand the thinking behind it, although I believe that it is mistaken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are getting quite excited. If we heard the Minister correctly, he said that no one would be penalised if there were no jobs in the area. That is comforting, especially for those in areas of high unemployment where there are no suitable jobs. Will the Minister now explain how he will guide his officers—in all the regions, with their different economic structures and job opportunities, or lack of them—to make a judgment about each individual client in the job shop, and so on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman that for each individual client, because the jobcentre officials need to tailor their advice to a client's particular needs and circumstances, which will be different in each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, the hon. Gentleman spoke about people having to pay massive fares in a fruitless search for jobs. Taking "appropriate steps" means those that it is possible for someone to take, given his circumstances, the locality, and so on. The amount that would need to be spent on fares is one consideration that would be taken into account. But plenty of job searches can take place without expensive fares being incurred. The worry so particularly expressed by the hon. Member for Heeley is exactly the type of consideration that would be taken into account in the claimant's individual circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish that there were plenty of jobs because then the problem would not arise. Does the Minister agree that there is no need for the clause because the Social Security Act 1975 provides a law
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>218</span>
on availability in that respect. Does the Minister further agree that this measure is just a jackboot tactic against the most vulnerable people in society?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a jackboot tactic. The provision will enable officials at jobcentres to help and guide individually the people whom Opposition Members say are among the unemployed, all of whom would like to be in work. There will be no problem if all are genuinely seeking work. They will automatically and on their own initiative be doing all that is required of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) asked about the 1975 Act, but it is not sufficient. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister of State said on Second Reading, and as my hon. Friend the Minister of State repeated this morning, decisions on appeal have shown that at present individuals need only make themselves available for work by signing on. Action can be taken if a claimant does not follow up a job opportunity that is put in his or her way or unreasonably refuses a job offer, but the present rules contain no requirement to actively seek work, as provided in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister realises that the clause refers to restricted availability in relation to work. When someone says that he or she does not feel fit enough to do the job offered, what medical officer will decide on that person's psychological or mental fitness? Surely we do not expect people to take jobs where they will work as cheap labour. The Minister is saying that he wants to hound people into jobs that pay sweatshop wages. We oppose that objective and the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to hound anyone. We will not do so and the Bill will not lead to that. We want to encourage people into jobs and to show them that they have a responsibility to seek work on their own initiative. The question of whether a person is fit for work arises now, and will not be affected by the Bill. The primary evidence for that comes from the individual's doctor. Someone's state of health is exactly the sort of factor that would have to be taken into account. The procedure should be tailored to the individual's practices and needs and to the locality. To make sweeping generalisations ignores the need to exercise sensitivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What would the Minister say about the figures for 1988, which reported 339,000 jobs and 506,400 unemployed claimants? Is the Minister looking to give them unemployment benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow the hon. Gentleman's question. Will he repeat it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were more people claiming unemployment benefit in 1988 than there were jobs. Obviously, some people without jobs are not claiming unemployment benefit. What are the Government doing about those figures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>219</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that one does anything about past figures. The clause seeks to encourage, to give incentive to and, in the minority of cases where obligation is required, to oblige those who are unemployed to actively and imaginatively seek work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall take the Minister back to two observations that he made a few minutes ago. First, he said that there was agreement on both sides of Committee that people should not be deprived of benefit if there were no jobs. If so, the amendment can easily be accepted and there is probably no need for the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Minister talked about someone who was taking steps to look for work but found that there was none. The Minister said specifically that if job circumstances were difficult and if there really was no work, there may be no appropriate steps for that person to take. The hon. Gentleman also referred to high fares and to health, and said that all those factors would be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to press the Minister, but that is not what his hon. Friend the Minister of State said this morning. My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) asked about someone seeking work in an area where there was none.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There were 300 vacancies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend said that there were 3,000 unemployed people and 300 vacancies, so in effect there was no work and no point in a 59-year-old miner looking for it. My hon. Friend asked the Minister of State specifically about someone who, after a number of weeks of actively seeking work in those circumstances, stopped looking for a job because he knew damn well that there was no work and that he was wasting his time, getting bitter and frustrated. My hon. Friend asked whether that person would nevertheless be required to continue to seek work for, say, an extra week or for a long period. The Minister of State did not reply, "Oh no he won't because we will take local labour market considerations into account and we will be sympathetic and understanding." Instead, the Minister of State replied, "Yes, he will have to go on seeking work to show that he is at least making an effort and trying to look for work," although the hon. Gentleman explicitly accepted my hon. Friend's argument that there was no work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government intend that no one will lose benefit under the Bill if, realistically, no work is available—I am sure that they do not—will the Minister say when the adjudication officer will decide that there is effectively no work available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady tried to create a difference between me and my hon. Friend the Minister of State. My reply was about circumstances where there were no jobs. My hon. Friend's reply was about circumstances where there clearly were jobs. My hon. Friend said, among other things, that the decision would depend on the nature of those jobs. A claimant would have to take the steps available to him in the circumstances. My hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>220</span>
Friend was commenting on a different situation, not on the hypothetical argument that I answered, that there were no jobs at all. There are few places where there are no jobs at all. If there are such places, there will be no steps for claimants to take in that locality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So the Under-Secretary is saying that if a theoretical vacancy is on the books for only two days, people in the locality will be required to actively seek work. In the unlikely event that literally no jobs are ever said to be available, not even those that the Government are sure exist but cannot describe because they do not know what they are, perhaps a claimant would not be deprived of benefit. If that is what the Under-Secretary is saying, I agree. He and the Minister of State are saying the same thing, and it is unacceptable in both cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is trying to take the argument to absurd conclusions. The clause requires that local staff at the jobcentre and the adjudication officer should act sensibly in the light of circumstances in the area. They will make the judgment of reasonable people on the basis that, of course, there are vacancies to be pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case cited by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), it would matter very much what the 300 jobs were, for how long they would be open and what the nature of the work was. All those questions must be asked, but they cannot be answered in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The adjudicating officer has the tremendous responsibility to make his judgment according to the types of vacancies, the cost of travelling to them and so on. Our amendments would make the adjudicating officer's job much easier because they would place on employers an obligation to tell him about the job market and how many jobs there were. Surely he can make a better decision on the basis of information about vacancies supplied to him by employers than on the basis of vague statistics published every other month, which are probably irrelevant to the job market pertaining.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps this is a good time to move on to the amendment to which the hon. Member for Newport, West spoke, but first the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) wishes to intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has again said something that is inaccurate. In discussing the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), the Minister referred to the lack of discrepancy and to looking into whether there were suitable vacancies for that 59-year-old ex-miner. As the Minister knows, suitability has always been part of the framework for our social security law, but that suitability for vacancies and offers will be wiped away by the Bill. After a short time, suitability will go out of the window and people's qualifications, age and so on will not matter. They will have to take any job. Therefore, the Minister has misled the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>221</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I did not mislead the Committee. The hon. Lady has misunderstood the import of the legislation. It is designed to act sensitively for the individual and to take into account his needs, state of health, experience, age and locality. Those are the exact considerations that need to be taken into account to judge whether people are taking reasonable and appropriate steps to obtain employment. Therefore, I do not accept what the hon. Lady said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 47 requires employers to notify a jobcentre of any vacancies that they are advertising or registering with an employment agency. At first sight, the amendment has its attractions as it appears to maximise the information available to people about job opportunities in a convenient way. But in practice it would not have that effect. Job agencies in the private sector, and the advertising media, have built up expertise, readership and connections in their specialist areas that jobcentres do not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would not be a good use of resources if jobcentres were to try to duplicate that. If they tried to make use of the information that employers were obliged to send, they would have to organise themselves differently and develop the type of expertise that other agencies have. It would be a long time before jobcentres did it as well and, meanwhile, most active job seekers would continue to use other sources, agencies, advertisements and so on. Some people might be persuaded not to use other sources if everything was communicated centrally. They would see a great spine of postcards, a notice board and so on at the jobcentre, and not go to other agencies, look at advertisements or make inquiries about jobs. That would be to the detriment of their job prospects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have only to think about nursing or secretarial staff agencies to know that people seeking such jobs are well catered for by them. It would be difficult to impose a notification rule on employers for some jobs and not for others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with interest to the Minister's argument, which is rather specious. Many provisions in the Bill are based on the findings of the London labour market, but the Government have ignored the bit about the ignorance among employers. The findings were that employers were simply unaware of the potential pool of suitable people whose qualifications and experience might be available to them. The Minister argues that because employers do not know about those people and, perhaps, entertain some prejudice against them, they are unwilling to look for them. He says that the obligation should be placed on the unemployed to pursue jobs through different means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is a valid argument that this group of people with the potential to satisfy vacancies should be put in touch with those vacancies, why should not that valid argument apply both to employers and to the unemployed? Why is it always only the unemployed—who, by definition, have fewer resources available to them than employers—who have to bear that burden? Why should the employer not also bear the burden? All that an employer has to do is notify the local jobcentre about a vacancy
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>222</span>
at the same time as he notifies the agencies. The amendment does not call upon an employer to take any major steps, so why is the Minister so concerned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not all that has to be done. If all the job changes were notified to jobcentres, that would create a huge task. It would involve assembling and ordering—especially in specialised areas—those jobs in such a manner that advice and help could be given in the same way as it is given by specialised agencies. It would be a nightmare to try to distinguish between the types of jobs for which employers were obliged to send notification and those for which they were not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The job agency sector has grown up and evolved in the past few years and become a complex and sophisticated service. It cannot be readily transferred, reproduced or even backed up just by passing the Opposition's amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot get away from the fact that employers ought to, and do, use the jobcentre when they find that it is a good source of recruitment for them, but, likewise, those who are without a job should look to the agencies and all the other places where jobs are advertised to find suitable employment. The jobcentre's role is to help, advise and point to the places where people might look for jobs that will suit their experience, age and position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of bringing the job seeker and the job together is not simplistic enough to be well served by producing a huge load of job notifications. If it worked and employers obeyed the new regulation, the result would not be the service that the hon. Member for Newport, West was thinking about. It was an attractive idea when the hon. Gentleman started telling us about it, because it would be wonderful if jobcentres had all the expertise and skills, and also took the form that he envisaged. There would be a one-stop centre displaying all the jobs available in the locality but, unfortunately, it is not that simple.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is obviously coming our way. We have certainly half convinced him and, encouraged by that, may we ask whether he agrees that the job carried out by agencies is specialised and separate? Private agencies tend to specialise in groups of people such as nurses. They employ people on an agency basis and part-timers whom they farm out. They run energetic campaigns to attract nurses and send them out to hospitals. That is specialised work, which is very different from that which jobcentres do. In the main, jobcentres cater for people at the lower end of the employment market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that if the amendment is accepted—we are hugely optimistic about that—the specialised agencies will carry on in the same way as they do now. They will provide a service that jobcentres have never provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment asks for a small change in the legislation. Employers will only have to send two cards instead of one. That will not create active work for the jobcentre. It will simply record where the jobs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>223</span>
are, and it will not be required to promote those jobs in the same way as private agencies—their profits depend on that. It wil keep a catalogue of those jobs, which is easy to do in these days of hi-tech— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Member who is not a member of the Committee withdraw beyond the Bar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The alternative is that unless that information is collected, how on earth can the adjudication officers or the Government decide that no jobs exist? The Minister said that when no jobs are available, people will not be asked to actively seek work. How will such information be obtained unless all job vacancies that are likely to exist for more than a few days are reported to a central body, the jobcentre? That system worked well in the 1950s and it works well in other countries such as Sweden. If jobs are registered, the humiliation and harassment of the unemployed, which will result from the test becomes unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. He appeared to retreat from his initial idea that there were many specialist jobs that need not be notified. If they are notified, which would be a substantial exercise, it is no good putting them in the bottom drawer of a desk and not bringing them out. By the hon. Gentleman's own admission, it is not a task that the jobcentre could efficiency undertake. Rather than my going towards him, he is coming towards me in recognising some of the complexities of the proposition that he tabled blithely, optimistically and with the best of intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said earlier that in this country we had never obliged employers to register vacancies at an employment agency. But, as he has just said, that was done in the 1950s. I may have midunderstood his earlier remark.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members, including the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) have invited Conservative Members to learn from history. We have learnt from history, as is demonstrated by the way in which the clause is framed. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will also learn from the scheme in the 1950s, which was not successful. It was dropped not because it worked well, but because it worked badly. The hon. Gentleman said that his proposal would not apply to jobs that were filled by word of mouth, but more jobs would be filled informally than they are now if there were such an obligation and that would not help job seekers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the 1950s the job market has evolved. Interviewing and the filling of jobs have become sophisticated processes. What was once a bureaucratic nightmare which did not help the job seeker would be even worse and more unhelpful today. I accept what the hon. Gentleman seeks to achieve, but I cannot advise my hon. Friends to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is drawing an incorrect analogy in talking about the 1950s, when there was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>224</span>
relatively full employment. It was more a matter of vacancies pursuing people than the reverse. To adduce that the system did not work efficiently then is irrelevant. When there are few vacancies which may not be suitable and many unemployed people it is essential for them to have places of contact where they can rely on obtaining maximum information. As my hon. Friend said, the Bill imposes a test and it is not good enough for the Government to say casually, "This might be a bit difficult and inconvenient. We are not sure that it will work well. It may inconvenience the private employment exchanges that are making a lot of money. We do not want the Department of Employment to develop this expertise." If the Department of Employment is so rotten at its job and cannot develop that expertise, it is disgraceful for the Minister to put the onus on unemployed people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Newport, West said, jobcentres have great skills in placing people in certain types of employment and in certain jobs. The jobcentres and other agencies have developed specialist skills. That is not to say that jobcentres cannot develop those skills further. No doubt there are areas in which jobcentres have been especially successful in impressing employers that they are a good source of recruits. The Government believe that employers should use the methods which they find successful. It is the role of agencies, including jobcentres, to provide advice, backing and information to facilitate job seekers in finding jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Newport, West remarked that few of those on the unemployment register went to the specialist private agencies in London. That may be so. Such agencies may deal with the type of work for which there is no shortage of vacancies. It is the objective of the clause that proper advice will be given about which agencies to choose and where to look.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. NICHOLAS WINTERTON 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>Attractive though it may be, no system would enable an individual to go to one place to learn about all the available opportunities. It would be a mistake to encourage the unemployed to take that view. That is why the Government cannot accept the amendment.</p>
	<p>The second part of amendment No. 62 seeks in effect to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of age. Such discrimination is unfair and destructive of the morale and self confidence of those on the receiving end. I sympathise with arguments advanced by Opposition members of the Committee that it is a problem which should be solved.</p>
	<p>Members of the Committee will have had the sad experience of hearing unemployed people at their weekend surgeries explaining that the reason they have no job is that they are over a particular age. That is their stumbling block in finding work.</p>
	<p>It is unfair, shortsighted and wasteful of employers to refuse to consider applicants because they are older. In doing so, they are doing themselves a disservice too. They are losing a valuable pool of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>225</span>
skills and experience. The amendment encompasses similar arguments which apply to those who have been out of work for a long time. Many of them have much to offer and their confidence and expectations will have been sapped by being without a job. That is why the opportunities provided by the restart programme and the extra incentive and assistance that the clause will provide—from job clubs to training—are so important. They are the route back to work which is difficult for them to take at one bound when they have been out of work for a long time.</p>
	<p>The government believe that employers should make full use of the talents of older workers and those who have been out of work for a long time, especially as the number of young people declines. That was emphasised in the White Paper published by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment and in his recent speeches. The Institute of Personnel Management equal opportunities code covers age discrimination and the institute seeks to combat prejudice among its members.</p>
	<p>The training programmes run by the employment training department are open to people up to the age of 60—beyond in some cases. As the number of young people declines, there is a huge practical incentive to all employers to consider older workers to fill their vacancies. There is a similar incentive to the long-term unemployed to persevere in their search for employment.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want the record of our proceedings to be accurate. Two groups of people are targeted in the employment training scheme: a guaranteed group of younger people, and another target group of people up to the age of 50. It is not a case of outlawing all the people coming on to the scheme, but they are downgraded. People over the age of 50 do not receive priority on the scheme. So, the Government are pushing older people to one side in their own schemes, and do not expect them to come back actively into the labour market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spoke from memory—accurately, I think—and had no intention of misleading the Committee, but shall look into the facts. Certainly the hon. Member for Ladywood is right in saying that when the schemes were introduced they concentrated on people who had been unemployed for a long time and on younger people. The reason was obvious and logical—those people had more of their working lives to be wasted in unemployment than older people. But, I do not believe that it was ever the intention of the Department of Employment to ignore or underestimate the needs of older people. Many of its training schemes have them very much in mind, and the age limits show it. I shall come back to the matter, because I want to be quite sure that what I have said to the Committee is correct.

Demographic trends are the most effective pressure to fairness and good sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) wish to introduce another pressure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening with growing incredulity, because the Minister is admitting much, if not all, of our case, that the employers are at fault. They are turbid and lazy, they go to the instant private agency down the road and do not bother to send an extra card to the jobcentre, they discriminate against the long-term unemployed and the elderly, they rarely hold interviews and have a low percentage of replies. People are angry when they see cards on display in both private agencies and jobcentres that put a very low top age limit on applicants. Yet, in this great attempt to bring together the jobs—real and mythical—and the unemployed, where does the pressure come? It comes down on only one side—the unemployed. The unemployed get the lash. Where is the pressure on the employers to make sure that they register all jobs? Where is the pressure to outlaw discrimination? It has been done in America, where there has been a law on age discrimination for 20 years, as was said earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the clause becomes law, the whole situation will change. If the unemployed are told that they have to prove that they are actively seeking work, employers must balance that by making sure that they tell jobcentres and the unemployed that jobs are available. Are we to tell the elderly who have been rejected, written hundreds of letters and had doors slammed in their faces, "Now you have got to get out and keep looking, keep trying even though there is only one Japanese factory in the area looking for labour"—probably for young women—"even though you will not know what half the vacancies are because they never reach jobcentres"? No pressure is being put on anyone except the unemployed, and that is unfair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is that demographic trends are putting very real pressure on employers, and that will be far more effective than any amendment that we might pass in this Committee. Those trends will have the effect on attitudes that we all want. It is no secret that there is a prejudice against the older applicant. In some places, the prejudice is greater than in others, but it undoubtedly exists. But, those demographic trends present a particularly good opportunity for change, and there are many signs that they are having an impact. I shall give two or three examples in respect of job clubs and the long-term unemployed. Texas Homecare is undertaking a recruitment drive to fill vacancies with those who have been unemployed for more than six months. Greenwich health authority is considering a similar approach and the possibility of adopting a job club. The Yorkshire Electricity Board, Sainsbury, Marks and Spencer, the BBC, British Home Stores and other organisations now realise—not out of total altruism—that their interests and those of the long-term and the older unemployed are linked. That is the most hopeful sign of all. I suggest to the hon. Member for Newport, West that it is much more useful than anything that we can say in Committee and any amendment that we might make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>227</span>
Nevertheless, useful things can be done. But, I do not believe that adopting the amendments and requiring employers to sign a declaration before they can use the recruitment facilities of a job club will meet and combat the prejudice which we all know exists. That is partly because employers do not discriminate simply out of unreasonableness or a dislike of older people—indeed, many are themselves in the higher age group—but because they think that their companies' interests require the recruitment of younger people. They believe that younger people have more energy, learn more quickly and are more flexible. Those of us who know older people who have changed their jobs realise that that is not so. Indeed, older people have experience. More importantly, jobcentres try to persuade employers who register with them to put aside unreasonable, pointless or unjustified age limits and to bring to their attention the qualities and contributions that older employees and the long-term unemployed might make. I believe that the jobcentres' approach is the most sensible way forward. That, combined with the pressures arising from demographic changes, can go a long way—and, in due course, the whole way—to solve this problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment. However, as this is a matter for the Department of Employment, I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman's comments and our debate reach my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have left amendment No. 61 until the end as it was the last to be tabled and I have not had time to examine it closely. As I understand the amendment and what the hon. Member for Newport, West said, it would widen the concept of actively seeking employment to enable the test to be satisfied by someone seeking self-employment. That proposal has advantages. I applaud its objectives. Indeed, one of our aims is to encourage benefit claimants to consider new areas of work. For some claimants, self-employment will be appropriate and desirable. However, my worry is about whether the proposal would provide too much scope for abuse by deleting the word "such".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to take the amendment away to consider it. I should also like to come back and say that we could accept it or, if not, find another way in regulations to achieve its aim. However, I make no commitment now that we shall find a way. But, if the hon. Gentleman is willing, I suggest that that amendment should not be pressed further so that I may give it such consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to return briefly to amendment No. 62 and the issue of whether it is necessary—the Minister argued that it was not—to require employers not to discriminate against older people. He said that demographic trends would be the most effective pressure, that they would be far more effective than anything that the Committee could do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I direct the Minister's attention to the case of Mr. Peter Warner of Etwall in the constituency of Derbyshire, South. He is a classic example of the real world as opposed to the theoretical world in which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>228</span>
Ministers currently live. The Minister, and other Ministers, have spoken consistently of the need for people to persevere in their efforts to seek work. Mr. Warner persevered. He has an engineering background—something which used to be a genuine badge of merit—and a successfully completed apprenticeship at Rolls-Royce. He worked in the Royal Navy and in engineering for many years, until 1985, when he was made redundant and remained unemployed for a year. He then broadened his horizons—as the Government wish—and became a stationery and mail clerk at a building supplies firm in Derby—from which he was again made redundant last August.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He says that he has applied for 28 vacancies and none of the applications has been successful. To his delight, the Department of Employment put him in contact with the postal deliveries supervisor for his area who seems to have had a lot of trouble—Conservative Members believe that this is prevalent—finding someone to carry out postal deliveries in Mr. Warner's area. There was urgent need for a postman and he was invited to start work on the following morning, which he duly did at 5 am. He is an enthusiastic man and was pleased to be offered the job. He worked for some days, and signed off. Later in the first week of his employment, he was informed by the Post Office that as he had completed the application form after having officially started work, they had only just discovered that he was 58 years old. He was 58 in October and began working for the Post Office in January. Because he is 58 years old the Post Office cannot keep him in the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He did a postal round to help to clear up the mail. He is precisely the sort of assiduous, well-meaning and hardworking person about whom the Government say they are so concerned. Nevertheless, because the Post Office is allowed to discriminate on the ground of age, what is open to him now? I do not know how to describe him. He cannot I suppose be called redundant. He is certainly not voluntarily unemployed. However, because he is 58, he will be caught by clause 7 which provides that he should be actively seeking work, but when he has found it, his age will debar him from continuing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not expect the Minister to accept amendment No. 61 which relates to vacancies. However, it would not hurt him to promise to reconsider the question of age debarment. We wish to return to it. It is all very well to say that demographic trends "will", or "might" help and that Sainsbury and Texas Homecare are thinking about a new approach and may do this or that. That is no use to Mr. Warner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the contrary, the changes that employers say are taking place are of great use and promise to people in the same position as that constituent. It is not a question of ignoring older people and letting trends take effect. Whatever the Committee does or does not do, the trends are real and are powerful aids to what we want to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment as drafted. What I will do, in reply to the hon. Member for Newport, West, is draw the remarks and feelings of all Committee Members to the attention of my right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>229</span>
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment. I know, as it is clear from his remarks, that he wishes to ensure that firms—not only those that recruit through jobcentres—take full account of the talents, skills and experience of older people. That is not simply brushing the matter aside, as the hon. Lady suggested. It is a far more practical suggestion than getting people to sign bits of paper which they are told they must sign so that their vacancy can be advertised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Meanwhile, Mr. Warner and others like him will still be subject to the "actively seeking work" test even though, as his example demonstrates, his chances of being accepted for work are not high.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It appears that there are now more firms than a short while ago from which his age would not debar him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was right in saying that people over 50 could participate in training schemes. As the hon. Member for Ladywood rightly said, the scheme is targeted on younger people, but anyone over 50 who has been signing on for six months or more can join such a scheme if he wishes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, both of us were right. I agreed with the Minister that, in theory, anyone up to age 65 can join the scheme but people are targeted up to 50. Anyone older has lower priority. That is Government practice in organising training schemes such as ET. In practice, they write off under-50 year olds by giving them lower priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I must express my disappointment that the Government will not support our amendments. We can hardly be accused of being radical. We tried to bring a little kindness, caring, understanding and heart into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Bill is aimed at encouraging people to realise their potential and to find a job. I like the word "encouraging". What better way is there of encouraging a claimant to get a job when he goes to a jobcentre or the DSS, or meets an adjudicating officer, then to give him a vacancy for which to apply? That is what I would call encouragement. Encouragement does not come by being given hell by an officer who has the power to take away what little income a person has and has a big stick to use if he wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was perhaps a misunderstanding earlier when the Minister stated that the test would be negated by the officers giving vacancy opportunities to claimants. I must put on record the fact that this does not confine the test to vacancies notified by the jobcentre. Rather, it exempts a person from seeking a job if the jobcentre has not found him a vacancy. The test would still apply. The tests are unfair and we do not agree with him, but at least our amendment would have made them kinder and more understanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's refusal to accept our amendment proves many things. First, it proves that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>230</span>
they have no confidence in their own claims that there are plenty of jobs to go round if claimants would get off their backsides and fill them. Secondly, it also proves that they are not prepared to make their agencies' officers help in any way to share responsibility for seeking vacancies and guiding claimants to suitable jobs. It also proves that the Government are not prepared to force their employer friends to take up their responsibilities by giving information to jobcentres when vacancies occur. It certainly proves that they will exert even more pressure on those who have already felt tremendous pressure by being out of work. It proves that the test is being used not for the benefit of the claimants but to save money, whatever the consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"By their fruits ye shall know them."</p></blockquote>
If the Government are concerned about the plight of older workers, we want more than words of sympathy. We want organised effort to extend to older workers the chance of employment. Unemployment is damaging to all age groups. The younger generation has grown up with employment uncertainty, but many older people who have worked since they were 14 or 15—until the recession in the British economy after 1979—find their situation unbearable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>231</span>
Amendment No. 42 suggests that we exempt over 50-year-olds from the provisions requiring people to prove that they are actively seeking work every week. If the Government accepted that approach, they could put in place special arrangements at jobcentres and in the employment service to assist older workers back into employment and overcome the crude and widespread discrimination that we all agree exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State laid great stress on demographic trends solving problems for us. It is remarkable how many problems the decline in the bulge in the number of 16 to 18-year-olds, which we have experienced only in recent years, will solve. When the Labour Government introduced the youth opportunities programme in the early 1970s it was meant to be a temporary scheme lasting five years to deal with the bulge in the number of school leavers. We knew then that there would be a bulge for about five years as a result of the post-war bulge. After the war people had more babies because the men were back at home and everyone felt there was more certainty and prosperity. I was born in that generation, which grew up and produced a second bulge when it had its own families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the second bulge has some effect on the youth labour market, it is a fairly minor factor. The fashionable rhetoric is that there will be a massive growth in employment opportunities for women because of the decline in the numbers of 16 to 18-year-olds. We are told that workers over 50 need not worry, that as a result of the decline in the numbers of young people, discrimination against older people in the labour market will no longer exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government practice writes off those over 50 as not being expected to obtain employment. That is recognised by the benefit rules in several ways. Claimants over 50 who have been out of work for over a year are required to sign on only quarterly. Those over 60 do not have to sign on at all. Those over 50 can refuse a restart interview. Those over 55 with substantial occupational pensions are, in effect, assumed to have retired even if they are still signing on and looking for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Statistics from the Department of Employment show that the proportion of unemployed people who have been out of work for two years or more rises steadily with age. Similarly, the change of an unemployed person getting back into work within a given period falls steadily as age increases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1987 Labour Force Survey showed that young unemployed people were less likely to have been out of work and looking for a job for a longer time than older people. Of the 16 to 24-year-olds, 70 per cent, had been in that position for under a year compared with 40 per cent, of those aged between 45 and retirement age. Only 11 per cent, of unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds said that they had been out of work and seeking work for over three years, compared with 35 per cent, of those between 45 and retirement age. Each study—there have been many—shows up Government practice. There is no contest between the two sides of the Committee. We agree that older workers face difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>232</span>
I shall read a letter written last February about the existing conditions of restart. It is from a man aged 47, who lives in Cleveland. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have just returned from a restart interview at the Redcar, Cleveland Jobcentre and would like you to observe the following comments.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I have been trying desperately to obtain employment both here and abroad but, so far, without success. My persistence, however, seemed to impress the interviewer and 1 was told that, short of re-training, the Employment Service could really do nothing more for me than I was already doing for myself. It appears, then, that my journey and interview were, in effect, unnecessary but I was under threat that 'people who do not attend interviews without good cause may lose their benefit'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I was told that my travelling expenses, by private vehicle, would be paid at the rate of 9.5 pence per mile, less the first £1.00 of expenses incurred, and was consequently offered the sum of 24 pence for my round trip of 13 miles.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Naturally, I refused this insulting offer."</p></blockquote>
He goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am 47 years old, divorced because of my continued unemployment"—</p></blockquote>
statistics show that prolonged unemployment leads to marital breakdown—
	<br><blockquote><p>"a non-smoker and from my single person's Supplementary Benefit I can allow myself the amount of £10.00 per week with which to buy food. My wasted journey to the Jobcentre and the cost of posting this letter to you have therefore caused me to forfeit three meals, or in other words, one day's food, and I assure you that my income is budgeted to the last penny."</p></blockquote>
He then says something rude about the Prime Minister. The guy is a BA(Hons) LTCL. His story is one of many. It is what older workers face as their prospects of obtaining employment are extremely small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will require such people to make even more applications for jobs which are overwhelmingly likely to be unsuccessful. Amendment No. 42 asks the Government to exempt over 50-year-olds from the Bill's requirements and, in co-operation with the Department of Employment, to make special provisions for older workers and ensure that they are offered jobs or retraining in a proper, organised way. If the Government are not willing to do that, the older unemployed are entitled to say, "We do not believe you when you say that you are concerned about us, because if you are concerned, action would be taken".
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Amendment No. 43 would exempt homeless people from the requirement actively to seek work. Conservative Members will be aware that there has been an enormous growth in homelessness in recent years. Once, only older, perhaps mentally ill people were on the streets around the tube in London. We used to refer to them as tramps. Now, more and more younger people are homeless, which is distressing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>233</span>
the growth in the number of homeless young people. The number of young boys and girls who become prostitutes has increased and there are other distressing sights that scar this supposedly prosperous and successful nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Committee an example that is tangentially relevant to the issue of youth homelessness. I met someone who had links with the citizens advice bureaux and who worked in Northern Ireland. He told me of a young Catholic man who worked in Milltown cemetery, and who was married to a Protestant girl. He was worried about that liaison—that might have interested the Minister in his previous incarnation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is he a saint?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister was better than he is now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the terrible events in Milltown cemetery after the shootings in Gibraltar, the young man became very frightened because he had a cross-community relationship, so be packed in his job and went to London. He was found to have given up his work voluntarily and his benefit was stopped for six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are hostels for the homeless all over the country—in the Birmingham hostel, people are worried and threatened by the Government's review of the way in which benefits are paid—but the problem is especially serious in the south-east. How will those young people be treated under the Bill? If people are homeless, the first thing that they do is to look for somewhere to live. They are therefore not in a good shape to look for work. Their lives are chaotic because they have nowhere to keep their possessions. Young people are not in priority groups for housing and will not be housed by local authorities. They are entitled only to advice. They sleep in hostels, on the streets and on friends' floors. They move about and are disorganised. Are the Government telling those young people that they must produce evidence, week by week, that they have been actively seeking work?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that some thought will be given to the needs of homeless people and that the Minister will give us the assurance that we seek.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 48 provides that the refusal of a place in a job club or on a Government scheme such as employment training cannot be taken into account in the decision on whether someone is actively seeking work. I said earlier that I sat on the Committee considering the previous Employment Bill. We argued at great length about the employment training scheme and were given assurance after assurance by the Secretary of State for Employment and some of his junior Ministers that the scheme would always count as voluntary. But if the new "actively seeking work" test functions in such a way that a refusal after an interview of a place on a scheme is held to suggest that a person is not actively seeking work, those undertakings are breached. So I hope that we shall be given specific and clear undertakings today that the refusal of a place on a job club, an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>234</span>
employment training scheme or any other scheme will not be used to question a person's status as actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final amendment in the group No. 40, in the name of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), deals with the special needs of people with disabilities. It has our full support, and I hope that some Conservative Members will feel able to support people with disabilities, if not other needy groups. The amendment simply requires that full account be taken of any limitation on people's activities caused by
	<br><blockquote><p>"physical sensory or mental impairment".</p></blockquote>
Again, I hope that I am not too optimistic in expecting firm assurances from the Minister. Three of the amendments in the group deal with people with special needs, and the fourth deals with an undertaking that was given by the Government that job clubs and employment training schemes would be voluntary. So I hope that there will be consistency between the previous Employment Bill and this Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I should like to repay the compliment that was made to me by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). I shall speak to amendment No. 40, and I support the other amendments that she discussed so eloquently. I am grateful for her support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 40 is a probing amendment, and we are right to demand answers from Ministers because we do not know what the fine print of the regulations will say. Commendable pressure groups and organisations such as the Disablement Income Group are right to ask the Committee to probe the Minister's thinking about the way in which the regulations may affect people who are physically impaired, because clearly it is difficult for people who are confined to wheelchairs, people who are deaf or blind, and people who need access to buildings or particular modes of transport to conform with the stringent procedures that able-bodied persons can easily carry out. I am sure that we shall be given an assurance by the Minister that such matters will be properly taken into account and that the regulations will not contain onerous conditions that might inhibit disabled people from passing the test of actively seeking employment.

As I understand it, the onus of proof will be on the person seeking unemployment benefit, and it must be more difficult for severely disabled people to prove activity in seeking work than it is for non-impaired people. We all know that disabled people are often unable to respond swiftly to opportunities. They have to plan their activities well in advance, and clearly, if the regulations are to be sensitive to the needs of disabled people, they must take that properly into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In essence, these are probing amendments to discover how the Government intend to react to groups of individuals whose needs are different from the generality of people who are unemployed and seeking work. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) wanted to know how the refusal of an offer of a place in a job club, for example, might be viewed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The majority of those matters will be better dealt with in regulations within primary legislation, and I hope that I carry the Committee with me on that. We share the concern that has been expressed by Opposition Members about the way in which the "actively seeking employment" test will operate in responding to the needs of special groups, and we want it to operate with considerable flexibility. There will always be variations between claimants, but here we are talking about specific groups that will need specific treatment in the regulations. Certain groups of unemployed people are bound to find it more difficult to present themselves as potential employees to employers, and three such groups have been identified in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will specify the factors that are to be taken into account in deciding what a claimant is expected to do to satisfy the test, but we shall leave it to the adjudication authorities to take account of additional factors that may seem relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that the regulations will be crucial to the Bill, so may we have an undertaking that draft regulations will be made available before Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be an unusual procedure, but no doubt there will be opportunities for hon. Members, particularly those who have served on the Committee, to contact me with suggestions about the regulations, and we shall be happy to take those suggestions into account. I cannot go further than that. Certainly, we shall be open to suggestions about the particular issues that worry them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 40, in the name of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), deals with disabled people, and amendment No. 42 deals with older workers. I take this opportunity to reassert our determination that both those groups will be dealt with in a flexible and sympathetic manner, and wearing my hat as Minister for the Disabled, I take particular note of the disabilities and health problems that may inhibit their ability to demonstrate that they are actively seeking work. At the same time, I firmly believe that it would be wrong to write off those groups, still
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>236</span>
worse to encourage them to write themselves off, because they would not be treated on a par with other people seeking employment. If those groups of people were picked out and not given the same encouragement and facilities to get back to work as others, they would be tempted to write themselves off and employers, too, would be tempted to write them off. That would be a grave mistake.

7 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am determined to find a way in regulations to ensure—in the words of the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire—that full account is taken of any limitation that may be imposed upon such people. That is right in the case of disability, and we have fully discussed age. We want to make sure that these people's circumstances are covered in regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar considerations apply to the homeless. Of course, we understand that if a person is homeless, it may limit the steps which he can take to find a job. Obviously, it would not be useful for a claimant to seek work in an area where he had absolutely no hope of finding accommodation, but if he can get work, it may literally unlock the door to accommodation for him. We shall seek to take all those factors into account as we draft the regulations, and certainly employment service staff will be anxious to help homeless people to identify areas where they may be able to find work in the hope that that, too, can lead to accommodation. It would not be right to use someone's homelessness as a reason for taking him completely outside the "actively seeking work" provision, but I believe that homeless people need to be treated as a special case in the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By her amendment No. 48, the hon. Member for Ladywood seems to suggest that we are making the employment training and job club offers compulsory. There is no question of that. The requirement to go for a restart interview is, as she knows, compulsory in the sense that people can lose benefit if they do not attend, but if an offer is made at the interview and is refused, there is no question of the person losing benefit because of it. Indeed, we shall not and could not use the power in the Bill to compel people to join what are essentially voluntary programmes. We hope that the ethos behind the Bill will encourage people to take part in the scheme as a way back into employment. There is no question of compulsion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I have an undertaking that the regulations will say what the Minister has just said, that refusal of a place in a job club or an employment training should not be taken as evidence that someone is not actively seeking work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall consider that, but I do not think that it is necessary. I believe that it would be necessary to achieve the reverse intention. Because the schemes are voluntary and there is no question of compulsion, I do not think that it is necessary, but I shall consider the hon. Lady's point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Research shows that many people who take up those places think that they have to do so

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>237</span>
because otherwise they would lose their benefit. That is what the punters think.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot pretend that everyone will read the words that I have just uttered in Committee, but there will be an awareness that the schemes are voluntary, not compulsory.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that it would not be normal for a Government to produce regulations before Report; indeed, this Government sometimes seem to have difficulty producing regulations at all when it comes to social security, and even more difficulty getting them right and legal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am nevertheless concerned that legislation—we saw this to perfection with the most recent Social Security Act—is drifting more and more into being enabling legislation, which more or less says that a scheme will be set up and everything else will be left to regulations that cannot be amended. That will happen if a later amendment of ours is not accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that in practice it will be regulations and guidance from the chief adjudication officer that will govern what is done, and the issues dealt with in the amendments highlight the problems with the Bill. The Minister says that he is afraid that if the disabled are taken out of the group of people who are required actively to seek work, it will encourage them to write themselves off. I can think of nothing more likely to encourage somebody to write himself off than the experience of writing, telephoning, visiting and contacting employers week in, week out, and being told that there is no work for him, which he probably knew in the first place if he has a disability. That is the problem. The Minister's difficulty is that he has introduced legislation which will catch all the unemployed when there are some for whom it is patently unsuitable. That has been our argument from the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he was anxious to help the homeless and that they ought to be a special case within regulations. I do not want to prejudice later arguments, and I may be rash in going so far without careful thought, but, if there is one group that ought to be taken out of the regulations, even more perhaps than the disabled, it is the homeless. Again, I can think of nothing more likely to make a person's homelessness persist than the need, when he is trying to find somewhere to live, to satisfy the requirement to be actively seeking work. We all know perfectly well that there is not an employer on God's earth who would employ somebody who, when asked his address, had to say, "Under Charing Cross bridge". It is utterly ridiculous and stupid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister's point that he does not want to write things into the Bill and he does say that the homeless should be a special case within the regulations. Nevertheless, they are a special case and ought to be taken out with the operation of clause 7, because the one search will damage the other, and they will end up in a vicious circle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of our warnings to the Government last year when they took steps against
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>238</span>
16 and 17-year-olds. Those warnings have fully come to fruition. I should not like my warnings now to come to fruition that when the Bill comes onto the statute book there will be greater numbers of people who are not only homeless but destitute. The unemployed of every age, not only 16 and 17-year-olds, will be wandering the streets of our cities;</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An intolerable legal structure is being imposed on the unemployed. Everyone who receives benefit will have to produce evidence every single week that they are actively seeking work. When we say to Ministers, who want to appear as decent human beings, that the Bill will cause grave problems for the unemployed, especially for certain groups, they say, "We agree. We are very worried about the over 50s, the homeless and people with disabilities, and we shall see what we can do with the regulations." We think, "This is good. There is some rational process going on here and we are achieving undertakings from the Government. That is welcome and is what Standing Committees should be about." But, one has to look again at the structure of the Bill. Either the Minister is giving us vacuous undertakings, which I am sure he does not intend to do, or he is promising that the regulations will lay down that the law will be breached for certain groups of people. That is the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State referred to people living in an area where there is no employment, but he is wrong about suitability. Suitable employment is out under this Bill. It is fallacious to argue that people should not have actively to seek work if they live in an area where there is no employment, unless he gives people permission to break the law which he is seeking to have passed. The Bill does not say that there has to be jobs. People will have actively to seek work every single week, no matter how mindless, stupid or soul-destroying it is, how cynical it makes them or how much they lose respect for the system, start to lie and apply for any old rubbishy job which they know they could never get, just to satisfy the bureaucrats. That is what the Bill will require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that it is best not to seek to vote now on the amendments, which deal with extremely serious and important matters, but to raise the issues again on Report and ask the Government to give fully considered undertakings about how the needs of those groups of people will be met. I hope that the Government will think their needs through in detail and deal with the problem that full assurances from the Government appear to lead to a breach of the structure of the legislation—or even be big enough to consider exempting some of the groups from the framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Logic becomes nonsense. There is to be an oppressive new approach to the treatment of the unemployed who seek work. The Minister said that he could not possibly consider exempting those over the age of 50, people with disabilities or the homeless because that would mean treating them less well. It would seem that they would have an equal right to be oppressed and harassed weekly. Surely words are ceasing to mean what we thought they meant.

If my hon. Friends agree—and, of course, if the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire agrees—it might be best to withdraw the amendment, but give the Minister notice that we shall return to the matter on Report when we shall seek firm and detailed undertakings.
