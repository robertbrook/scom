HOUSING BENEFIT SUBSIDY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed [this day): No.</i> 145, in page 8, line 10, leave out "In section 30 of the 1986 Act, for Subsection (8)" and insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) In section 30 of the 1986 Act, in subsection (2) (computation etc of housing benefit subsidy) the words following paragraph (b) shall cease to have effect and after that subsection there shall be inserted—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) In relation to rent allowance subsidy, the Secretary of State—
<ol>
<li>may specify any such additions and deductions as are referred to in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) above; and</li>
<li>may exercise his discretion as to what is unreasonable for the purposes of paragraph (b) of that subsection,</li>
</ol>
by reference to determinations made by rent officers in exercise of functions 10 conferred on them under section 121 of the Housing Act 1988 or section 70 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 ("the Housing Act functions").</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2B) The Secretary of State may by regulations require a local authority in any prescribed case to apply within a prescribed period to a rent officer for a determination to be made in pursuance of the Housing Act functions.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2C) Regulations may make provision with respect to any authority—
<ol>
<li>which would have been required to apply within the period so prescribed to a rent officer for a determination under the Housing Act functions, had the first regulations under subsection (2B) above come into force on 1 April 1989; and</li>
<li>which did not in fact apply to a rent officer within that period for that determination;</li>
</ol>
and any such regulations may, in particular, require the authority to apply within a prescribed period to a rent officer for that determination to be made and may in prescribed cases require him to make that determination on 25 prescribed assumptions.'</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2) For subsection (8) of that section".—[<i>Mr. Peter Lloyd.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>4.30 pm</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this, we are also considering Government amendment No. 146.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to proposed amendment No. 145, (g), in line 4, after "subsidy)" insert
<br><blockquote><p>"after the word 'calculated' there shall be inserted the words 'without regard to the date or. which any claim for housing benefit was made',".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I said this morning, with this we are also considering amendment No. 163, in page 8, line 46, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(8F) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where an authority cannot reduce the eligible rent under the provisions of regulation 11 or 12 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987, the amount of subsidy shall be calculated by reference to the full amount of the eligible rent without regard to the provisions of those regulations."</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As you reminded us earlier, Mr. Winterton, the amendments are narrowly drawn, so I shall
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 746</span>
attempt to deal with them and shall not go over much of the ground covered this morning.<br><br>
At present, local authorities normally receive housing benefit subsidy at 97 per cent of their expenditure on housing benefit—it used to be 100.6 per cent. Lower percentages apply to certain housing benefit expenditure, for example, to overpayments and discretionary payments. It is unfair to penalise local authorities for making payments that they are legally obliged to make—they have no choice—and the treatment of backdated benefit payments is a blatant example of that.<br><br>
We heard earlier about consultation. I remember when my right hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore) was Secretary of State. Consultation with local authority associations lasted not for a few weeks or months but for years. Local authorities are now treated shabbily by the Government.<br><br>
The clause demonstrates a problem caused by two of the Government's rival obsessions clashing. One Department is obsessed about deregulation in housing and wants to let 1,000 Rachmans bloom, with the free market wild, rampant and red in tooth and claw. The Government know that the result will be soaring rents for tenants. The conflicting obsession is the great desire of the DSS to keep down its spending.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0436">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 747</span>
As was said earlier, a great crisis looms. There is no alternative to rapidly increasing rents. I remember the laughter in the Chamber when the ineffable Secretary of State for the Environment announced that last year's housing legislation would allow housing authorities to let out any empty houses that they had on their hands. The Secretary of State was aghast and baffled when hon. Members laughed.<br><br>
In response to comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) about London, I rang local authorities in Wales and asked whether housing was standing empty because people could not be bothered to rent it. I asked if that accounted for 1 per cent or 2 per cent of the housing in Newport, or elsewhere in Wales. I was told that it did not. The problem is the great increase in property values in the area. South wales has had the biggest increase in any area in the past year—in some areas a staggering 40 per cent increase in the value of housing. The aim of the Housing Act 1988 is to allow rents to reach a market level, plus a percentage allowed for management activities, so we shall soon witness rent levels which have increased by enormous percentages over the average in South Wales.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that Sweden had similar, terrible problems with housing and Government subsidiaries? Sweden abolished all of its Rent Acts and now there is a surplus of housing and ordinary people on modest incomes can pick and choose. Does the hon. Gentleman think that would be a good idea'</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always glad to hear of the successes of Socialist Governments in Scandinavia. I am familiar with Sweden and have been there several times. I am delighted that the Socialist system has earned the encouragement and enthusiasm off the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs Gorman). My view of the hon. Lady improves all the time. She vigorously attacked Government policy on the taxation system as it affected women. I should welcome more interventions from her as she is clearly moving slowly towards the Opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that you will rule us out of order, Mr McWilliam, if we delve any further into Swedish housing policy, but it is worth pointing out that while rent controls were removed, Sweden has much stricter controls on conditions. The Minister with responsibility for housing promised that environmental health officers would be given greater powers. Inspectors have great powers in Sweden, but not here. If the two policies were put together, housing conditions would be more favourable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr Flynn) does not follow his hon. Friend down that line. It is wide of the amndment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasant subject and we should be delighted at any time to table an amendment about Swedish housing and social conditions.<br><br>
Regulation 72(15) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 provides:
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 748</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"Where the claimant makes a claim in respect of any period before the date on which the claim was. or was treated as. made and he proves that there was good cause for his failure to make that claim throughout the period between any date in that earlier period and the date on which the claim was or was treated as made, his claim shall, subject to section I65A of the Social Security Act 1986 (52 week entitlement before the date of claim), be treated as made on the first day of that earlier period from which he can prove good cause."</p></blockquote>
It is hard to believe that that is all one sentence. It is virtually incomprehensible. It is a fine example of DSS-speak of 1987 vintage, not the DSS newspeak of which we have heard so much.<br><br>
The regulation means that local authorities are legally bound to make backdated payments of benefit for up to one year where the claimant can show that he or she had a good reason for failing to make the claim earlier. We could quote many such examples. Many claimants fail to make housing benefit claims because of ignorance of the system, wrong advice, language or literacy problems, sickness or family stress. In all those cases local authorities are obliged to pay backdated benefit. It is no fault of the local authority and there is no way that it can control it.<br><br>
Local authorities receive only a miserly 25 per cent subsidy on those payments. Because local authorities receive reduced subsidy, in many cases claimants are not positively encouraged to claim backdated benefit. That is a disincentive for local authorities to carrry out one of their principal functions. Local authorities often cannot afford to publicise those payments because they must bear the addtional costs. Success in publicising the scheme will mean greater costs being borne by the authorities. Local authorities lose in every way.<br><br>
Claimants and local authorities lose because of the punitive level of subsidy on backdated payments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 613 deals with another problem. Local authorities received a letter on 31 January from the DSS. We are now getting to the nub; the Government's position is fatuous. The letter outlines the proposed housing policy subsidy arrangements for 1989–90. The letter states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a local authority is unable to reduce the eligible rent under the provisions of regualtions 11 and 12 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations, subsidy at the rate of 50 per cent will be payable on benefit awarded on that part of the eligible rent above the rent officer's determination."</p></blockquote>
Regulation 11 deals with cases where the claimant's home is larger than is reasonably required by the people living in it or the rent is unreasonably high. In such cases the local authority can reduce the eligible rent or rates on which housing benefit is calculated, but not if a member of the family is over 60 or incapable of work or if there is a child in the family and they cannot be expected to move to cheaper accommodation. In other cases no reduction is made for the first 13 weeks if the claimant could afford the accommodation when he or she first moved in.<br><br>
In all these cases, although the local authority is obliged to pay housing costs based on the full rent for at least 13 weeks and in many cases a much longer period, only the "reasonable market rent" will qualify for a full subsidy. Benefit payments for rent above that level will qualify for only 50 per cent of subsidy.<br><br>

The welfare righs adviser for the Association of London Authorities has commented:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is grossly unfair that legislation puts a duly on local authorities to pay housing benefit over the threshold in certain circumstances and then penalises them for doing so by reducing subsdiy on these payments to 50 per cent."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 163 would make subsidy payable at the full rate on these benefit payments, which seems reasonable in the circumstances. It is grossly unfair that unwilling local authorities which have had the housing benefit system forced upon them should now have this financial millhouse round their necks. I am sure that they will express their astonishment and anger at their position. The Government seem to be saying, "We have not got the regulations together in time ourselves, but we told you what we wanted to do. We cannot make you do it but we shall punish you if you do not do it." It is an extraordinary situation. One malicious piece of Government legislation is trying to leapfrog another. A set of rules is being imposed that cannot go through in time, yet local authorities are expected to act on them.<br><br>
The situation is reminiscent of the lines in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland":
<br><blockquote><p>"I'll be judge, I'll be jury,' said cunning old Fury; 'I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.'"</p></blockquote>
Local authorities have received harsh treatment from the Government. Some have been sentenced to death. The Government found the Greater London council disagreeable because it was the wrong political colour and so its building now lies empty on the other side of the Thames. They have put pressure on many other local authorities and cowed them into in a deep coma so that they accept these oppressive rules and the Secretary of State takes more power to himself.<br><br>
It might be fruitful for the Opposition to read "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire". The main decline came because the power that had been devolved to the whole empire was taken back by Rome. The body of power was then concentrated in Rome and it eventually led to the collapse of the Roman empire. This might lead to the collapse of the Thatcher empire.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that make the Opposition the Vandals and Visigoths?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed it does.</span></p>
<p>4.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr Peter Lloyd)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall start on amendment No. 163, which would require a high rate of subsidy to be paid in certain cases where, under regulation 11(3) of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulation 1987, the rent was seen as unreasonably high by the rent officer. In those cases the local authority is required to meet rent in full where cheaper suitable accommodation is not available to a claimant who belongs to one of the vulnerable groups set out in that regulation. Otherwise it can reduce benefits to a level which reflects a reasonable rent in each case. There is no requirement for it to pay in full. If there is no suitable accommodation at a market rent the local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 750</span>
authority is obliged to pay the full benefit but will be reimbursed by only 50 per cent. But that 50 per cent. provides an incentive which is intended to ensure that the local authority uses its influence and resources to see that the vulnerable person is rehoused in appropriate accommodation at the right rent if it is available.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) was saying, as Opposition Members have been saying throughout, that there is no consultation. In fact the orginal suggestion when consultation started was for no subsidy in those cases. It is as a result of consultations and representation that it is at 50 per cent. I understand that that is insufficient for the hon. Gentleman, and I understand why he has tabled his amendment. But the Government have listened to representations—not as completely as he would like—and that is why we have the 50 per cent. subsidy.<br><br>
The local authority can to some extent influence the outcome. The Government are quite aware that there are bound to be some cases where, however careful people are, there will be an extra cost to the local authority. Therefore, 0.5 per cent. of housing benefit expenditure has been added to the level of subsidy to provide resources for local authorities to meet such situations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is that figure based on? If it is based on an assessment of rent increases that will result from the Housing Act 1988, I should like to test that against the market rents that are starting to emerge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Gentleman a hard and fast answer to that. I think that I know the answer, but I shall not attempt to reply until I know for certain. An amount is written into the system because it is accepted that there will be some cases where local authorities have an extera expenditure. Nevertheless, we want to have an incentive in the system for the local authority to behave as sensibly as it can in the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it a stick?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it is a stick.<br><br>
I was not so clear about the purpose of amendment (g). I understand from the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) that he wants a higher rate of subsidy than we propose in another area of expenditure where the local authority has some control of costs. That is where claims to benefit are backdated to a date before the date on which the claim was made. A subsidy rate of 25 per cent. has been set for such expenditure, with additional provision made for the authority's reasonable costs in the rate support grant arrangements that I have just described.<br><br>
If the local authority see good reason why a claim could not have been made earlier, it will backdate it. If there is not a good reason, it will not do so. Again, an incentive is put on the local authority to make that judgment, and in the rate support grant there is an amount of money which is compensation for that. The hon. Gentleman would argue that this compensation could be used for other purposes. It is up to the local authority to make a reasonable, sensible decision according to the circumstances. Therefore, it has the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0438">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 751</span>
discretion to make a judgment that influences the outcome in terms of subsidy. Again, the incentive for it to do so is built into the system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister reminds me of a cartoon in which the representative of the Transport and General Slaves Union came out of a negotiation looking very pleased with himself saying, "We've got a 45 per cent increase" The next question was, "How much do you get now?" He said, "Nothing," and after a lot of thought said, "Well, perhaps we should hang out for a bit more." It seems an extraordinary negotiating position to offer zero per cent to the local authorities and that they should shout "Hallelujah," because they get 50 per cent and then have to find the other 50 per cent<br><br>
We know that is one of the favourite obsessions of the Conservative party that there are three evil forces in the world: the wicked trade unions, the last Labour Government and local authorities. Those three monsters play the major role in Conservative Members' demonology. They influence their thinking. Their assumptions about local authorities are that they consist of people who go round throwing money away and that they behave in a totally irresponsible manner.<br><br>
The reality is very different. Why on earth do the Government think that they need to apply such a punitive stick to local authorities in such a manner? Local authorities take pride in running a tight ship.<br><br>
Many of us have long experience of working on local authorities and could give the Committee many anecdotes to establish that. I can give more than anecdotes. In my own local authority the rates have been kept at zero increase for the past three years, we have a record number of Labour Members and the authority is recognised as being sensible and giving good value, like the vast majority of local authorities. But the Government assume that unless they apply the punitive, damaging, self-defeating regime that is proposed, local authorities will behave in a totally irresponsible way and allow claimants of housing benefit to get away with all sort of abuses.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there were no cost to the local authorities, there might be a tendency in that direction. I was responding to the hon. Gentleman's constantly repeated refrain that the Government never consult. He began his remarks just now by saying, "No consultation," yet the very 50 per cent about which he was complaining is the result of consultation. I did not say that consultation means that one side always gets everything that it wants. I was trying to establish that there was consultation and I hope that he will recognise that there was in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We obviously apply different meanings to words. We have had a vocabulary problem on both sides. In the celebrated and hilarious notes on the Bill prepared by the Conservative Central Office, there is an account of the consultation which said, "We consulted groups A, B, C, D, E, F and G. They all disagreed entirely with what we proposed, but we shall go on and do it." The idea of consultation is that one does not simply allow people to submit material; one actually listens to it or reads it, and possible changes one's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 752</span>
point of view. One does not say, "We'll offer you nothing, but we intend to give you 50 per cent. anyway." Consultation should be a serious procedure, in which the Government listen and take account of what people are saying.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Government entered the consultations with the figure of 50 per cent up their sleeves. If there is agrgument between 0 and 97 per cent. which is what the argument seems to be, to end up with 50 per cent is marginally in favour of the local authority.<br><br>
I did not remark on the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman). When she said that, with deregulation in Sweden, the number of houses available grew, the hon. Member for Newport, West replied that Sweden had a Socialist Government. If the previous Labour Government had taken a leaf, in advance, out of the Swedish Socialist Government's book, they might still be on the Government side of the Committee. I did not say that the previous Government are a demon for us; they are the reason why we are sitting on the Government side of the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary seems to think that he has gone into negotiations to offer something to local authorities. When the crucial decision was made in 1984 to shift housing benefit from the Department of Health and Social Security to local authorities, an underpinning commitment should have been made that the Government would pay out the housing benefit from the national kitty through the social security budget if the local authorities administered the system. That is not the case. The Government are telling local authorities that they must pay. For the Government to say that they will pay 50 per cent of it as a bonus payment because they are not paying all of it means that they are not being forthright with ratepayers. They are not explaining that, from now on, the ratepayers will carry the burden of those on housing benefit in their areas.<br><br>
On amendment (g), I remind the Minister that local authorities receive only 25 per cent subsidy on the overpayments and backdated payments; they have to pay 75 per cent. The Minister used the word "incentive", but it is a penalty to the local authority that pays out. Therefore, authorities do not encourage people to make back-dated claims, because they know that they will have to pay 75 per cent. It goes on to their local authority bills, which leads to rate-capping and all the rest of it, and puts them in the penalty box.<br><br>
The local authority pays the penalties under the present system, though that is being changed now; whether for good or worse will remain to be seen next door in Committee on the Local Government and Housing Bill. Why will the Minister not accept that local authorities are paying the price for the shift of housing benefit? It is not an incentive to them to tell claimants to claim.<br><br>
The Minister was surprised by what was going on in the Glasgow unit over the making of last year's transitional payments. When people are not paid out their due regularly, the money is held in account for them
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0439">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 753</span>
somewhere and is accumulating interest because it is not paid out. Therefore, someone is benefiting by not paying out that money to claimants. If my claims were not met, I would be tempted—as I am sure many other hon. Members would—to include penalty clauses demanding the interest saved by not paying out the benefit in the first place. What the Minister refers to as an incentive to local authorities to make backdated benefit payments is not incentive at all. Claimants are discouraged from claiming because local authorities pay the price. If they arc really acting in the interest of ratepayers in their areas, they know that the key is not to encourage people to put in their applications.<br><br>
The amendment suggests that both claimants and local authorities will lose because of the punitve level of subsidies on backdated payments. I cannot see how the Minister can justify handling the system back to local authorities and saying, "you adminster it, you pay the money", while taking that money away from them.</span></p>
<p>5 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman waxes eloquent but only puts one side of the argument. There needs to be an incentive for local authorities to control costs in areas where they have some discretion Otherwise, residents will end up paying either as ratepayers or as taxpayers.<br><br>
We recognise that there will be additional, backdated expenses—for which there is a reasonable explanation why they have not been paid earlier—and those have been provided for in the rate support grant. The hon. Gentleman asked on what basis that was calculated. It is half of 1 per cent of actual housing benefit costs in 1987–88, which is £32 million.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move as an amendment to the proposed amendment, (c), leave out lines 15 to 25.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments to the proposed amendment: (d), in line 17, after "(2c)" insert
<br><blockquote><p>"If a draft of the first regulations under subsection (2B) above has been published before 1st April 1989 and those regulations are made in the form of that draft,"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 754</span>
(e), in line 22, after "period" insert "or otherwise"<br><br>
(f), in line 24, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"and any such regulations may. in particular require"</p></blockquote>
and insert 'requiring'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment (c) proposes to delete section 30 (2C) of the 1986 Act, which we consider to be unacceptable. The Government intend that, from 1 April 1989, local authorities should be required to refer rent allowance claims to a rent officer within a prescribed period. Government amendment No. 145 adds a new subsection (2B) to the 1986 Act empowering the Secretary of State to make regulations on the subject. Unitl the regulations have been made, a local authority cannot be compelled to carry out that procedure, and the regulations cannot be made before 1 April because the Bill will not have received Royal Assent.<br><br>
However, far be it from the Government not to find a way round the problem. They have the legal power to do as they propose and their amendment seeks to impose a retrospective obligation on local authorities. For example, if the regulations are made in September of this year, local authorities will be required to refer to rent officers any claims made between April and September which have not already been referred. The rent officer will then have to make a determination based on the circumstances at the time of the claim, which may have been several months earlier.<br><br>
May I say in parentheses that only the optimist who wrote the guidance that we received imagines that the Government will make the regulations by this September. To judge from their track record, they may not get round to it until the following September.<br><br>
It is an outrageous proposal. Retrospective legislation is usually condemned by whichever party is in opposition, but this is retrospective legislation on a new scale and of the most blatant kind. It seeks to compel local authorities to implement regulations that have probably not even been drafted, and before Parliament has approved the principal legislation which gives the power to make those regulations.<br><br>
If the Secretary of State for the Environment had made the necessary provision in the Housing Act 1988, the regulations could have been made before 1 April, but he has a devil-may-care attitude to legislation, as the courts have ruled more than once, and did not get round to it. As the Government do not have the legal power they need under the Housing Act, they must rely on this Bill to provide them. If they cannot get legislation right, they should defer trying to implement it until they have got it right, or at least until it exists.<br><br>
No order which specifies the function of rent officers under the Housing Act has been made. The Minister's whole case was based on the rent officers' functions, but he does not know what they will be any more than we do because the order has not been made and nothing suggests that it will have been made by 1 April. The Government have not even made a subsidy order for 1988–89. It took us a couple of days, with the assistance of the Library and others, to lay our hands on the draft subsidy order for last year. If we in the House of Commons have great difficulty obtaining those orders, it is hard to see how local authorities will be able to do it.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0440">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 755</span>
As a subsidy order has not been made, we do not know what effect the rent officer's determination will have on the amount of subsidies payable. Therefore, local authorities cannot know how much rent allowance they can safely award. They are put in an impossible position - they have to guess what somebody whose functions are not defined will decide to do under legislation which is not yet drafted or on the statute book, but which will say something when the Government get around to thinking what it might say.<br><br>
In addition to the local authorities' problem, there is the problem of the rent officers. They may be required to make retrospective determinations many months after the date of the original claim. Even if one argued—I doubt whether anyone could—that the Government's proposal was right in principle, we would still object strongly to the way in which the proposed subsection is drafted. That is why amendment (c) seeks to delete it.<br><br>
Amendment (b) seeks to ensure that the regulations to be made under section 30(2)(b) of the 1986 Act, which require local authorities to refer claims to a rent officer, would not have retrospective effect unless a draft of them had been made available before 1 April and unless the regulations, once made, were in basically the same form as the draft. In other words, local authorities should receive from the outset guidance as to what they are required to do.<br><br>
The Minister may suggest that as local authorities will have been fully informed of the Government's intentions, there is no need for the draft regulations to be in place. However, we have already observed changes in the notes on clauses and the rules defining employment and part-time work, Moreover, the very tabling of Government amendment No. 145 shows that the Government's intentions may change. The amendment is not what the notes on clauses say the clause is for. I do not say that it is out of order, Mr. McWilliam, but it is not the minor, technical matter that the clause at first appeared to be addressing. So there is no question that the Government's intentions have changed since the Bill was laid before the House and since it came into Committee.<br><br>
Perhaps we can presume that the Governments intentions changed when Government amendment No. 145 was tabled earlier this week or at the end of last week. If the amendment is carried, local authorities will be required to act on the Government's present intentions. Therefore, local authorities need some assurance that those intentions will remain the same once they have acted and the consequences of their decisions on levels of subsidy take effect.<br><br>
The Minister may say that there is no need for draft regulations to be published before 1 April because local authorities will have some information, but we suspect that the Government do not want to publish them in draft because they do not yet know what the regulations will say. If that is the case, the smallest justification for making those regulations apply retrospectively disappears. To justify their amendment to their own Bill, the Government must tell us that they know what will be in the regulations to the extent that they will be able to publish them in draft.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 756</span>
Amendment (e) makes a correction to clarify the Government's intention and to improve their proposal. It deals with the requirement for a local authority to refer a claim to the rent officer. The amendment would remove that requirement if a local authority had already referred such a claim. Under section 30(2)<i>(c)</i> of the 1986 Act, a local authority could be required to refer the claim if it had not done so within a prescribed period, even though it might have done so immediately after the prescribed period. We hope that inserting the words "or otherwise" in the section might be useful.<br><br>
Amendment (f) seeks to clarify and to limit the proposed regulation making power which is too widely drafted. As the section stands, it would allow regulations to make any provision with respect to an authority which, even in a single case, had not referred a claim to the rent officer. That is a power which is so open-ended as to be unprecedented, even under the present Government.<br><br>
The amendment would limit the regulation-making power to require the local authority to refer a particular claim that has not been referred to the rent officer if it is felt that a referral should have been made, and prescribe the basis on which the rent officer is to make his determination. Otherwise, the proposal is so widely drafted that it could cause serious problems for local authorities and means that they would come under pressure when there was some minor omission in their actions rather than a wholesale default on the duty that the Government amendment places upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With the removal of statutory controls on private sector rents, there is a danger that high rents will be charged to housing benefit claimants in the knowledge that they will be met from public funds. The purpose of the rent officer arrangements is to ensure that claimants have their rents met through housing benefit where the rent is a proper market rent, but that the Exchequer does not subsidise housing costs which are above that level and which exploit the availability of housing benefit. To achieve that, we need to be sure that the rent officer arrangements will apply to all claims made on deregulated tenancies, including those made in the period before regulations can require authorities to obtain a rent officer's determination. Amendment (c) would prevent this and is therefore unacceptable, as the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) guessed it would be. In the view of the Government, it would be quite unreasonable to treat authorities differently depending on whether they do or do not make applications before the inrtroduction of the regulations. That is why we need powers to deal with cases where the authority has failed to apply for a rent officer's determination in the period before the regulations are made requiring them to do so. Amendment No. 145 will ensure that the arrangements apply equally in all cases and I therefore urge my hon. Friends to reject amendment (c).<br><br>
Amendment (d) would require regulations under paragraph (2B) to be in their final form, and subject only to Parliamentary approval, by 1 April 1989. As the hon. Member for Derby, South expected, I consider it inappropriate to place a requirement on Ministers to publish a final draft before the date on which the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0441">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 757</span>
power to make regulations is enacted. Moreover, it is our intention to make the regulations under paragraphs (2B) and (2C) of amendment 145 as one statutory instrument.<br><br>
5.15 pm<br><br>
The Opposition said that that provision has not been discussed or made known and has been kept close to the Government's chest. It has not been kept close to the Government's chest because we have not yet decided what it should be. On most of those matters, the hon. Lady is not giving a full picture of the discussions that have taken place. However, I agree that this is a complicated set of changes which place a considerable burden on both sides.<br><br>
The hon. Lady mentioned the housing benefit subsidy arrangement. It has not been in place for long, but there has been a good deal of discussion with local authorities. The 1988–89 order will be made shortly. There is no doubt whatever about the rates of subsidy that will be payable and local authorities and the local authority associations are well aware of them.<br><br>
The requirement to pass information to the rent officer is neither unclear nor diffuse, nor of recent consideration. The Social Security Act 1986 contains powers to require authorities to supply the information to rent officers. The amendment takes account of the fact that it would not be proper to place the requirement on rent officers to make determinations without also formally requiring local authorities to apply for those determinations. A clear change is being placed upon local authorities; but there is no lack of clarity about what is required of them.<br><br>
The provisions under paragraph (2B) will require authorities co make applications to rent officers and those under paragraph (2C) will set out the arrangements where an authority has failed to make applications in the period before the regulations under paragraph (2B) are made. We need to consider those regulations carefully, particularly the assumptions which may need to be made by rent officers in certain cases, and will, of course, consult the local authority associations fully on the draft regulations as soon as possible with a view to making them immediately after, or as soon as possible after the Bill receives Royal Assent. I accept the hon. Lady's genuine point and I recognise that there is a concern that local authorities should be entirely clear about which cases should be referred to rent officers. I can assure her that there should be no doubt about that. Detailed procedural guidance was issued in November 1988 and the categories of cases are set out in the relevant orders specifying rent officers' functions, which will be available before 1 April. We shall ensure that copies of them are sent to each local authority. For those reasons, I ask my hon. Friends to reject amendment (d).<br><br>
I assume that amendment (e) is aimed at cases where a local authority has made an application to a rent oficer for a determination on a case during the months before the regulations come into effect, but they have taken longer to make the application than the period which will be specified in the regulations as the normal period within which such applications should be made. I take it that the intention is to ensure that, in those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 758</span>
circumstances, the local authority does not have to make a further application to the rent officer when the regulations take effect.<br><br>
If that is what the amendment is intended to do, I accept the principle, although I cannot accept the wording of the amendment. We shall seek to find words that I can introduce on Report that will give effect to what I understood the hon. Member for Derby, South to be saying and what I understood from her nods when she was able to pay attention to me. If she can nod again, I shall be able to leave that point as one on which we agree in principle.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Having been brought up in a large Irish Catholic family, I can easily listen to two conversations at once.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not doubt that for a moment—I wondered whether the hon. Lady could listen to two conversations and nod at the same time.<br><br>
Amendment (f) would limit the scope of the regulations to be made with respect to cases arising in the period before the regulations take effect, where no rent officer determination has been sought. It would mean that regulations could only specify that the local authority should apply to the rent officer for a determination on those cases, within a set period; and provide for assumptions which rent officers should make in certain cases. I have considered this carefully and am satisfied that the amendment would permit us to achieve our intention of ensuring that cases which arise in the period between 1 April and the date the regulations come into effect should be subject to a rent officer's determination. I therefore accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we are pleased that the Minister intends to accept amendment (f) and to give further consideration to the issues raised by amendment (e). One is always grateful for small mercies, particularly in such circumstances. Nevertheless, I shall advise my hon. Friends to press amendment (c) to a Division because of the way in which the Government are manipulating the law. I am torn as to whether amendment (c) or (d) is preferable; it is a difficult decision to make.<br><br>
What the Minister said was carefully drafted and read. I am not sure whether someone who was not paying the closest possible attention would have realised that, within those polite phrases, the Minister was telling the Committee that the regulations will deal with a period before the Government have the powers in law to compel local authorities to take the action they seek. The Minister said, "We shall need the power to deal with these cases, in case one local authority behaves differently from another. We must not allow two authorities to be treated differently."<br><br>
The Minister was basically saying that the power was needed to deal with cases where an authority has not been willing to take action which the Government required. This is before the draft instrument to provide that power has been laid before the House, never mind carried into effect. It is a whole new generation approach to retrospective legislation. Perhaps we should be less critical, as we may find it useful in future
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0442">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 759</span>
to say, "We shall take powers to compel various people to do what we want. We won't tell them what these steps are. If they don't act before we've taken the powers they'll be jolly sorry because we'll punish them." That is a weird principle of law-making, but I suppose that a Government might find it useful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is also one-directional. I have yet to hear of a retrospective rate support grant settlement. I met the Minister on behalf of my authority of Leeds. It has kept precisely to its grant-related expenditure target, yet it has been penalised below that target this year and is £18 million short. If retrospective legislation means that a local authority is not given its full entitlement to housing benefit costs for the year, will its rate support grant settlement for the previous year be adjusted? I suspect that it will not, and that the authority will pay the price.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is probably right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is not sure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My God! The Minister has a nerve. The one thing that is clear is that the Government are not sure what they are doing, why they are doing it and when they are going to do it. When they have made up their mind they might condescend to tell Parliament. The Government have a large majority and most of the time they can confidently rely on their colleagues in another place to pass their significant legislation, but even so it is amazing that the Government should seek to legislate in this way.<br><br>
Heaven knows, the Government are not usually shy about introducing literally hundreds of amendments on Report or later. I expect that course will be repeated because the Bill contains a pensions section. The Government are incapable of getting it right on the third attempt. Even the Bill will return to the House on Report, for consideration of Lords amendments and on Third Reading, and the Government will have many opportunities before the summer to add new provisions when these are ready. It is patently obvious that relevant provision is not ready.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is now acting on behalf of the Minister with responsibilities for housing. The difficulty is that there has been a reconciliation between legislation in the Department of the Environment and in the Department of Social Security.<br><br>
Recently, in the Chamber, the Government brought before us a statutory instrument on the right to privacy for council tenants. They did not realise that the instrument was incompatible with the Housing Act 1988, which gave landlords permission to examine tenants' rent accounts. Surprisingly, after we had waited four hours at night for the instrument to be put before Parliament and discussed, it was withdrawn. We are still waiting for it to re-emerge. As soon as the Government discover that a measure is incompatible, they withdraw it and try to effect legislation by the back door.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend was, I am sure, deservedly fortunate. The Government have put through social security regulations that were later ruled illegal by the courts. But I take my hon. Friend's point. We can only laugh at what the Government are doing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 760</span>
because it is so incredible and absurd.<br><br>
We are not even examining a set of regulations about which there is a query because they may be defective in law. We are giving the Government powers to make subsidiary legislation while penalising local authorities for not complying with powers that the Government do not have. That is extraordinary.<br><br>
If I understood the Under-Secretary's rather obscure phrases correctly, I think he said that the reason why the Government do not want to place the draft regulations before us prior to 1 April is not that the sections on the main area of powers are not ready. He said that of course the Government know what they are doing. The rates of subsidy are known as is the role of rent officers, although those regulations have not been published either. The Government know what they are, even though they do not want Parliament to know.<br><br>
According to the Under-Secretary all the information is known, but it cannot be published because the Government have not yet worked out how local authorities will be penalised for not complying with regulations that the Government know about but have not published. I think that that is what the Minister was telling the Committee, although of course he did not put it quite like that.<br><br>
The procedure is bizarre and completely unacceptable. Even previous Conservative Governments would not have touched precedents that treated Parliament in this way. It becomes clearer with every passing day that the Government consider that they have a majority to do precisely what they like. They know that most of their Back Benchers will not pay the slightest attention to any of these debates and will not care tuppence what the Government do, whether it is within or without the law, as long as they get their own way and Tory Members are returned to their constituencies. Parliamentry democracy is becoming of less interest to the Conservative party as time passes.<br><br>
5.30 pm<br><br>
It remains of interest to the Opposition, however. even though it does handicap democratically-elected Governments who try to do precisely what they choose and run roughshod over everyone. That is why I recommend to my hon. Friends that we, at least, should not countenance this blatent abuse of parliamentary procedures, and should press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p>Amendment made to the proposed amendment: leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"and any such regulations may, in particular require"</p></blockquote>
and insert "requiring". —<i>[Mrs Beckett]</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed.</i> That the amendment, as amended, be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to dwell long on the amendment. However, I feel that we ought to point out again what the Government are doing. From reading the notes on clause 12, it is clear that the tenor of the clause is about local authorities being required to supply information, and that if they are lax, or have difficulty supplying the information, it becomes difficult for the Government to decide how much subsidy they ought to pay, which in turn means that there is an implied problem for the local authority. We know that the Government do not always describe the facts publicly in the same way that they do in private, but even the description from Conservative Central Office for the benefit of Back Benchers states that the clause enables the Secretary of State to withhold or estimate payments for housing benefit subsidy where an authority fails to provide the required information because that will help to ensure that local authorities exercise proper control over housing benefit costs. That is what clause 12 would have done until a couple of days ago. Now the clause provides a mechansim not to enable local authorities to exercise proper control over their housing costs, or to know what they are doing, but to enable the Government to penalise local authorities for not complying with a non-existent law. That is a fairly major change. I am grateful to the Minister for providing the note that explains what the Department's amendment seeks to do. I am even more grateful that we thought to ask him for it. It helpfully tells us that, as we anticipated, no drafting was done on many of the regulations and that local authorities will need to be consulted.<br><br>
It is indefensible that the Government seek to use the clause to make such changes. We are used to the idea that the Government will make up a Bill as they go along. We are used to the idea that the Government will make up a Bill as they go along. We are not used to the idea that, when they have not had time to do so they take powers so that when they have the time, they will apply the powers retrospectively. That is a new departure, and despite their acceptance of a minor amendment to improve the drafting, we shall vote against the proposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I could, I would have tabled an amendment to the explanatory and financial memorandum, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Clause 12 amends the Social Security Act 1986 to enable the Secretary of State to withhold from, or estimate, payments of housing benefit subsidy to a local authority".</p></blockquote>
It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"It also enables the Secretary of State to withhold subsidy".</p></blockquote>
It should have ended there and not referred to information and evidence because that is not what it is about. If the Government have decided that local authorities should administer housing benefit, they should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 762</span>
sort out how and when the payments should be made and to whom. The Government have a commitment to make those payments and they should honour it. The Department of Social Security may not see it in these terms, but it is plain that the Government are using housing benefit as a last lever to penalise local authorities. The Secretary of State for the Environment and the Minister with responsibility for housing have their hands on the budget of the Department of Social Security. The Government give the impression that housing benefit comes from the rates, the local kitty, but it does not. It comes from the centre. The Minister is nodding his head in agreement. Why, then, will not the Government underpin the full amount? They know that under the Housing Act 1988, local authorities are forced to meet rents in full with housing benefit payments. Under the clause, housing benefit can be used as a lever to force local authorities into financial difficulties. That is an underhand way of carrying out a vendetta against local government.<br><br>
I do not defend the clause but if local authorities are to pay housing benefit costs and raise the money to do so, we should consider the way in which local government is funded—poll tax, rate support grants and so on—and ensure that it has the means to support the poor. Let us not pretend to fund from the centre and then tell the local authorities that they will get back only 25 or 50 per cent of the payments. That is what will happen in practice. The measure is not a technicality about providing information and evidence, that is just the gloss on it. It carries much more weight than that. The Government have so much legislation going through Parliament that they cannot keep up with it and Bills are colliding into one another. The Housing Act 1988, which became law on 19 January, had not been reconciled with existing regulations. New regulations are being drawn up in the light of that Act. In the next Room the Local Government and Housing Bill is proposing new terms for housing benefit and there will be a new regime for local government. Regulations made by the Department of Social Security will collide with the Housing Act 1988 and with that Bill. The price will be paid for the clause by local authorities and those on benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) all the way down the track because I think that he was talking more about the clause than the amendments.<br><br>
We seek to ensure that the rent officers' role in these matters is not merely at the Secretary of State's discretion but is put in the subsidy order laid before Parliament and therefore subject to parliamentary debate. I believe that the Opposition may find that acceptable even if they do not like what is in the orders. At least this procedure will ensure that their role will be set out formally in an order that has to come before the House and will not rest with the discretion of the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Leeds, West reminded us—almost as if I had forgotten—that the bulk of the payment, 97 per cent for regular payments of housing benefit, comes from the Government. Therefore, it is wholly reasonable that the Government should have a proper account of how the subsidy is spent and whether
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0444">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 763</span>
it has been spent in the manner laid down. The Government can have that proper check and control only if they have the proper information within a reasonable time. The hon. Gentleman knows a great deal about this subject and he is aware that subsidy is paid out at regular intervals during the year on account and that there is a reckoning at the end. There can be a reckoning only if the information is passed back to the centre, and it needs to be sufficiently full and complete for the reckoning to be made properly.<br><br>
The amendments and the clause ensure that there is a penalty that the Secretary of State can apply to ensure that he has that information in full and that it is timely. There may be occasions when the information cannot be provided either because it has not been properly collected or recorded by local authorities or, because for reasons beyond control, the information is not available. On those occasions, the Secretary of State needs a power to make a calculation about what should be paid, what the balance should be and what the reckoning is on the best available evidence. The amendments to the clause provide that power and I thoroughly recommend them to the Committee.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>5.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 155, in page 8, line 16, after 'State', insert
<br><blockquote><p>', after consulting bodies representing the local authorities concerned,'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 157, in page 8, line 28, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(8BB) Before prescribing particulars or conditions for the purposes of subsection (8B) above, the Secretary of State shall consult bodies representing the local authorities concerned.'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Bill was published and we came to the Second Reading debate on the Floor of the House, I was puzzled by clause 12 and particularly by subsection (8A) which states in relation to housing benefit:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subsidy shall not be payable to an authority until either—
<ol>
<li>they have made a claim for it in such form as the Secretary of State may determine; or</li>
<li>if they have not made such a claim, the amount of subsidy payable to them (apart from subsection (8E) below) has been estimated under subsection (8C) below."</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 764</span>
Being of suspicious mind, I assumed that that was a way to further central Government control over local authority expenditure and perhaps to claw money back from local authorities that are deemed to have exceeded the level of housing benefit expenditure—the subject of many amendments today.<br><br>
On Second Reading the Minister chose not to answer my question; I do not quarrel with him for that because he had only 40 minutes in which to reply to the debate. I do not recall a response but, if I am wrong, I shall stand corrected.<br><br>
The basis of the Bill and, indeed, of the past two Social Security Acts, has been that central Government give themselves great powers and then issue a series of regulations that can only be prayed against on the Floor of the House. Occasionally, therefore, we have a one-and-a-half hour debate on a particular matter, with no ability to amend the regulations. But surely the least that we could expect is that the Government would consult those who must implement this part of the Bill.<br><br>
As for implementing the Bill's provisions that are entirely within the ambit of the Department of Social Security, it could be argued that it is fair enough for the DSS to make the regulations. In that instance, the only ones who are not consulted are the poor people who claim social security.<br><br>
I am not happy with the system of regulations anyway. But it is eminently and totally reasonable that local authorities should at least be consulted on the matter, as proposed in the amendments, before the Bill is enacted because it will have a considerable effect on them.<br><br>
The Government have an obsession in disliking local government and, in the past 10 years, have abolished those aspects of it that they felt able to abolish. Moreover, they have taken powers and influence away from local government and placed enormous responsibility on it. For example, local authorities are expected to keep the streets clean, the bins empty, the restaurants clean, the food shops at a good standard, and so on. Yet, at the same time, their rate support grant or equivalent expenditure is cut, so it is more difficult for them to do the job and they are blamed for not doing it.<br><br>
Now, with the housing benefit regulations, new demands are placed on the local authorities in respect of the private rented sector, which we discussed earlier. Subsection (8A) provides that subsidy shall not be payable until the authority has made a claim
<br><blockquote><p>"in such form as the Secretary of State may determine".</p></blockquote>
I am nervous about those words. What do they mean? It puzzles me, as I am sure it puzzles my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) whom, in one of his rare flights into honesty and correctness, Andrew Roth described as being obsessed with housing. That is fair enough because my hon. Friend is, and he should be proud of it; indeed, we are proud of him.<br><br>
However, I am greatly puzzled. It seems that it will not just be the Secretary of State for Social Security who will prescribe that form. Also to be considered is the role of the Department of the Environment in its allocation of rate support grant, or whatever the equivalent will be called in the future. Will it set limits on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0445">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 765</span>
housing benefit expenditure in that respect? We need to know the relationship between the two Departments on that matter. It is a serious worry to local authorities.<br><br>
The Association of London Authorities, which represents mostly although not exclusively, inner-London authorities, writes:
<br><blockquote><p>"We … believe that any provisions of this nature should emerge after a process of consultation with the local authority associations. Clause 12 docs not specifically mention the duty upon the Secretary of State to consult before defining rules as to subsidy claims and payments."</p></blockquote>
There are plenty of other occasions when the Secretary of State in whatever Department is required to consult the relevant authorities or organisations. It does not seem to apply here. Amendment No. 155 aims to rectify that and ensures that that consultation takes place. The Secretary of State might reach an amicable arrangement with local authorities and remove their worries. Perhaps he can do that. But they should at least have the opportunity to put their point of view to him. After all, they will have to carry out the regulations and ultimately will have to direct or misdirect people into private sector accommodation at God knows what rents.<br><br>
The need for consultation also applies to requirements to be imposed on local authorities under subsection (8B) to supply "prescribed particulars" relating to the subsidy claim and to comply with
<br><blockquote><p>"prescribed conditions as to records, certificates, audit or otherwise".</p></blockquote>
Here, too, failure to carry out the requirements may result in the Secretary of State withholding
<br><blockquote><p>"so much of any subsidy … as he thinks fit".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 157 requires the Secretary of State to consult the local authority associations before prescribing the particulars to be supplied under section 30(8B). I can see all manner of difficulties, particularly with rent levels in the private sector rather than in local authority accommodation. The case for local authority rented accommodation where housing benefit is paid is fairly straightforward. The local authority would know what its rent levels were and would have records of payment and so on. The same would apply in the rest of the socially owned sector, such as housing associations.<br><br>
It becomes very difficult when one considers the private sector tenant. The Government are keen on private sector landlords; they are not so keen on private sector tenants, particularly if they are in receipt of housing benefit. My experience of dealing with private sector landlords was in the past as a tenant and a councillor and is now as a Member of Parliament representing an area where there are many of them; I do not particularly like them as a breed. I do not find them particularly efficient, helpful or in the least bit user friendly. They are quite the opposite to their tenants, particularly those who are trying to get repairs done, or when they are trying to get rid of a protected tenant to let the property on the open market. They are quite unpleasant. That is where Mr Van Hoogstraten comes to the fore.<br><br>
I ask the Minister first to give a simple undertaking that there will be consultation with the local authority associations. That is not too much to ask. Secondly, will he clarify once and for all what powers he has to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 766</span>
require information from local authorities and what that information is? If it is simply the amount of money that they have paid out in housing benefit, that should be fairly straightforward. Where there is a question of disputed rents and revaluation of propery throughout the year through the revaluation of rent levels by the local rent officer, there is much scope for complications.<br><br>
The sting in the tail, however, is the power to withhold money from local authorities at a later stage. In that case the local authority would lose money that it had already paid out and run into a deficit in the following year in its housing revenue account. It would carry forward a deficit from the previous year. Draconian local government laws have been introduced successively each year since 1979—some existed even before that. It appears that Ministers and Members of Parliament can spend as much money as they like, for any purpose and at any time that they like, and are not personally responsible for any of it. If they were personally responsible the Secretary of State for the Environment would have been surcharged several million pounds years ago, the Attorney-General would have been surcharged £6 million for pursuing "Spy-catcher" and every other Minister would be in the bankruptcy courts. That responsibility does not apply in those cases, but it does in local government. I am worried that councillors will be put under enormous and understandable, moral pressure to ensure that tenants in the private sector can retain their tenancy.<br><br>
Tenants must retain their tenancy so that full housing benefit is paid to them. If they get behind in their payments, the courts have a duty to remove that tenancy from them. If at the end of the year the Government decide that the local authority has not made the claim in the prescribed form and a deficit is carried forward, will the district auditor turn up on the town hall steps and announce that the councillors have been profligate in paying housing benefit to people so that they may retain their tenancy? The position is double-edged. The local authority loses, but the councillors become legally responsible for the expenditure of moneys which should be paid to them by the Secretary of State, but which may not be under this part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Department of Health and Social Security was split into separate Departments, for Social Security and for Health, some of us thought that that meant an upgrading for both Departments. However, giving the Secretary of State for Social Security the power to estimate the subsidy and, under clause 12(8D), to withhold part of it, makes him vulnerable to a Secretary of State for the Environment who wants to have a hold over a local authority and who nudges his elbow to think of a reason for withholding the subsidy in the first place. That effectively makes the Department of Social Security subject to the whims and wishes of the Department of the Environment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point and there is nobody to whose whims I should less want to be subject than the Secretary of State for the Environment. If one wanted to live in the countryside, the safest place would be right next door to the Secretary of State for the Environment because there would be no danger of an intrusive development taking
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0446">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 767</span>
place nearby. There would be no danger of a motorway or an airport being built or even of having dirty water. It would be the safest place in the world to live, just as some people say that the safest place to live is next to Greenham common. The Secretary of State for the Environment is a good man to have as a neighbour, but a bad man to live two doors away from. Unfortunately, 99.99999 per cent of the population live more than two doors away from the Secretary of State for the Environment, so they all have a problem.<br><br>
If I were the Minister, I should be angry. I hope that it did not happen when he was unfortunately off ill last year, but the Secretary of State for Social Security has been outmanoeuvred by the Secretary of State for the Environment, who has taken the reins in this matter. The Secretary of State for Social Security has been put in the position where he cannot operate social security law without the approval of the Secretary of State for the Environment, who not only knows little about the environment, but who knows even less about social security law. That is a bad position to be in.<br><br>
We are asking for something simple, which will not take the Minister long to reply to, so we can reach the other amendments that we are moving today—as my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has reminded me in uncharacteristically terse language. Although it was not as terse as the language used yesterday in the Chamber by Mr. Speaker, it was the type of terse language that only old and dear friends may use to each other. I look forward to a soupçon of a speech from the Minister—I know that his voice is tired after a hard day—to say that he will consult the local authority associations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am not aware that any terse language from the Chair was reported in <i>Hansard</i> this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be rather more than brief because I want to take up some of the general points made by the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn). I may risk another terse word from the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), but no doubt she will say it out loud rather than pass a note.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) made his own flesh,—and probably that of his hon. Friends—creep with suspicions of malicious intent in clause 12. It has no hidden meaning. The Government want to obtain proper and full information from local authorities about subsidy that has been paid out. Local authorities know what benefit should properly be paid and in what circumstances. Our job is to obtain that information in good time so that, at the end of the year, we can ensure that the local authority has been properly and fully paid, but not overpaid or underpaid. The Secretary of State needs the information for that purpose.<br><br>
6 pm<br><br>
The Secretary of State's conslusion is subject to the scrutiny of auditors. It is not just a matter of the Secretary of State having powers to write subsidy rules. He has a duty to ensure that the Government pay the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 768</span>
subsidy that they are obliged to pay. It is necessary to impose the possibility of a penalty on local authorities if they delay producing information without good reason. A number of local authorities still have not submitted their returns for 1987–88. They may be owed money by the Government, but they may have been overpaid and should refund some money. Whichever way it is, local government finance and central Government finance should be organised so that decisions are made and accounting conclusions reached at a reasonably early date. That is the purpose of the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the need for probity in local authority finance; accounts must be complete and up-to-date, but I am worried about the penalty aspect. Often it is beyond the powers of a local authority to obtain information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then they have good cause for not providing that information. Such provision is made in the clause. In those circumstances, the Secretary of State has power to make the best estimate that he can. That will depend on information that that local authority can provide and the experience of other comparable local authorities. That will enable a fair calculation to be made when a local authority cannot provide the necessary information.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Islington, North also said that it will be difficult to keep proper information about private sector rents and benefits. It is relatively simple for the local authority to keep correct and regular records of its tenants and housing benefits. As the private sector is more variable, greater differences arise between tenants in property owned by different landlords, but a reasonably efficient local authority should know how much benefit it paid and in what circumstances.<br><br>
It is not difficult for an efficient local authority to provide that information in a timely and full way, after the end of the financial year. As that falls in April, we expect that information to be provided during October. If the records have been kept well, that gives enough time to deliver the information.<br><br>
The amendments would legislate for consultation arrangements that already exist. Representatives of the local authority associations meet my officials regularly and are fully consulted on any proposed changes to the housing benefit scheme. I know that Opposition Members talk as if that were not so, but consultations are regular and all aspects of the housing benefit scheme are put on the agenda. The Department will continue to do that, so the hon. Gentleman has one of the assurances that he sought.<br><br>
With regard to amendment No. 157, the Department of Social Security is already obliged under section 61(7) of the Social Security Act 1986 to consult the associations on draft regulations. Therefore, the amendment would add nothing to existing arrangements for consultation on regulations, which are already obligatory under statute. It would be unnecessary and unwieldy for provision to be made within primary legislation to cover all circumstances on which my Department already consults the associations. Regulations are in a special category. It is possible to identify
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0447">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 769</span>
them clearly as items on which consultation takes place and they are already accounted for in the Act.<br><br>
Amendment No. 155 would legislate for consultation on an issue that is not subject to regulations. There are many such issues on which consultation with the local authority associations does indeed take place, but they will not be the same each year. It would not be helpful to single out some issues to put into legislation and to leave out others. If we attempted to pass legislation for all the circumstances in which officials should consult it could in some cases constrain those circumstances. It would not improve the overall effectivenes of consultation arrangements. Indeed, they might be jeopardised, which would be a pity.<br><br>
I assure the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that the associations will continue to be consulted by the Department in the usual way, which is a fuller and more regular process than he and his hon. Friends are willing to admit. I hope that the Committee will recognise that we place great store on those consultations. It is vital that both sides understand the intentions and problems of the other because if they do not, each will have more problems. That would be in the interests of neither.<br><br>
One amendment is already taken care of and the other would not help. I appreciate the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's belief in the importance of consultation, but I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: From what the Minister has said, I take it that there will be consultation on this issue, as there should be on all matters. I would be happier if it was enshrined in legislation that there must be consultation. Toe danger of permissive consultation—if that is the correct phrase—is that one side might decide that it is not permissible.<br><br>
Local authorities have no choice because they have no power to enforce the Secretary of State to consult them on any matter unless they choose to take him to court under the rules of natural justice. I do not recommend that, as they would probably be surcharged. I accept that the Minister is saying that there will be consultation, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 8, line 21, leave out 'thinks fit' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'has good reason to believe may not be payable'.</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p>No. 158, in page 8, line 29, after 'authority', insert', without good reason,'.</p>
<p>No. 162, in page 8, line 46, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(8F) Where the amount of subsidy estimated under subsection (8C) above for any year is found to be less than the amount that would have been payable if the conditions of paragraphs (a) to (c) of that subsection had been satisfied, the difference between the two amounts shall be payable as an additional subsidy.'</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments try to improve the relationship between local authorities and the Govern-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 770</span>
ment. That relationship is becoming like that between a divinity with supreme powers and the most amoebic, protozoan form of life. We might as well say that the organ grinder consults his monkey or the dog trainer consults his dog. It is a similar relationship. We hope that the Secretary of State's elected dictatorship is being whittled away as we speak and that Richmond and Pontypridd have a message for that dictatorship. The Secrtary of State is taking untrammelled powers.<br><br>
Amendment No. 156 is self-explanatory. The Secretary of State may do virtually anything that he thinks fit or that comes into his head. Any whim is permissible. We are simply suggesting that he should have some reason for it. The proposed subsection (8B) of section 30 of the 1986 Act gives the Secretary of State power to withhold
<br><blockquote><p>"so much of any subsidy … as he thinks fit"</p></blockquote>
until
<br><blockquote><p>"the authority has supplied him with prescribed particulars relating to their claim … and complied with prescribed conditions as to records, certificates"</p></blockquote>
and all the other details, or until
<br><blockquote><p>"he is satisfied that there is a good reason"</p></blockquote>
for failing to do so.<br><br>
Amendment No. 156 limits that power by allowing the Secretary of State to withhold subsidy only to the extent that he has a good reason to believe that it may not be payable. What could be more reasonable than that? If there was a doubt about a particular part of the local authority's claim, only the amount of subsidy to which that part related could be withheld. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, will he confirm what the Government's intentions are?<br><br>
Amendment No. 158 is similar in intention. The proposed section 30 (8C) gives the Secretary of State power to pay subsidy on an estimated basis if the local authority has failed to make a claim, supply the prescribed particulars or comply with the conditions on the records, certificates, audit and so on within the prescribed period.<br><br>
That could result in a substantial loss of subsidy, especially because there is no provision for reviewing the subsidy payment if and when the conditions of the section are satisfied. The subsection makes no allowance for the reasons why the authority may have failed to satisfy those conditions within the prescribed time limit.<br><br>
That might have more to do with the unreasonable demands that are repeatedly placed on local authorities by the Government rather than with any defects or inefficiencies in the authorities. In that respect, subsection (8C) differs from subsection (8B), which allows the Secretary of State to withhold subsidy only if there is no good reason for the authority's failure. That is a rather strange difference.<br><br>
Amendment No. 158 would prevent the Secretary of State from making an estimated assessment of subsidy if the local authority had good reason for not complying with the various conditions within the time limit. That should be nomal practice. If it has a reason, it should have the chance to explain, and the Secretary of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0448">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 771</span>
State's powers should be limited in the slight way that we have suggested. Therefore, it an authority made a claim but could not reasonably be expected to supply all the information required by the Secretary of State until the later date, a subsidy would be paid on the basis of the claim. If it turned out to be wrong, section 30 (8E) would allow the error to be corrected in the following year.<br><br>
Amendment No. 162 adds a subsection to section 30 of the 1986 Act. It ensures that if an estimated subsidy is paid under subsection (8C) and the estimate later turns out to have been too low, an additional payment can be made. Without the provision, the Secretary of State's powers would be far too wide. He would be able to estimate the amount of subsidy using such criteria as he considered relevant, and there would be no procedure under which the estimate could be challenged by the local authority. It may be possible that subsection (8E) allows an adjusting payment to be made in a subsequent year for that purpose, but it is not clear whether the wording
<br><blockquote><p>"the amount of subsidy … is found to be incorrect"</p></blockquote>
would cover that possibility, when the Act specifically allows the Secretary of State to make an estimate and use his powers to the best of his ability. Even if subsection (8E) does cover it, it does not oblige the Secretary of State to make good the underpayment. It uses the word "may" rather than the word "shall". That is why amendment No. 162 is preferable. For the local authority it will be a case of "Tails, you lose; heads, you lose as well."</span></p>
<p>6.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We spent some time earlier on the subject that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) raises. I shall reply to the amendments first and then say a word about the Secretary of State's intention.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 156 and 158 would make changes to sub-sections (8B) and (8C) which empower the Secretary of State to withhold or estimate housing benefit subsidy where the necessary evidence in support of a local authority's claim is not provided by the authority. If an authority fails to provide satisfactory evidence of its expenditure, it is likely that its subsidy cannot be calculated accurately. That could mean that, without powers for the Secretary of State to withhold or estimate subsidy whenever an authority has failed to supply evidence in support of its claim, that authority might stand to receive more subsidy—or less subsidy—than if it had provided the information.<br><br>
The Committee—and, I think, the hon. Gentleman—will agree that such a situation should be avoided. We want an accurate resolution of the problem: the correct and full amount of subsidy should be paid, not an overpayment and not an underpayment. Yet that is exactly what could happen if we accept the amendments, because they would enable the Secretary of State to withhold subsidy only where he had good reason to believe that it was not payable. He should be able to withhold subsidy until he has been given sufficient information on which to decide whether it is payable. The amendments would mean that he could
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 772</span>
estimate subsidy only where the authority had failed to provide the particulars or comply with the conditions without good reason. Sometimes there may be a perfectly good reason for the authority's inability to supply the information, and when that happens the Secretary of State should be able to make an estimate.<br><br>
These powers will not be invoked lightly, and it would not be right for subsidy to be paid where evidence had not been provided to justify the payment. Equally, there may be occasions—regrettably, and only after efforts have been made on all sides to procure the necessary information for the settlement of a claim, and there can be good reasons for not providing information—when the only sensible solution is for the Secretary of State to estimate the subsidy, even though the authority's failure to provide information may have been beyond its control. Otherwise, the authority might receive no payment for expenses that it had incurred.<br><br>
I am not certain what amendment No. 162 is designed to achieve, but I assume that its intention is to ensure that, should further evidence be received to show that an amount of subsidy that has been estimated is too low, a compensating payment will be made to the authority. As the hon. Member for Newport, West suspected, that is already provided for under subsection (8E) which ensures that, should there be an underpayment of subsidy in any one year, it can be rectified. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary. It would require the Secretary of State to ensure that he gets the information on time and in full. He then has an obligation to see that subsidy is paid according to the published rules in the subsidy order. He does not have powers to alter and change subsidy at will. His powers are to ensure that the correct amount of subsidy is paid, and when there is not sufficient information to do that to make an estimate based on the best information available to him, and on the practice and experience of other comparable local authorities. For those reasons, the amendments are unacceptable. Amendment No. 156 would create difficulties for local authorities, rather than help them.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked how the Secretary of State might intend to use the powers. I cannot say categorically and certainly what our conclusion will be. but we think that claims and information submitted should be in by the October after the financial year has ended. A reminder would be sent out to those local authorities that had produced neither the information, nor a good reason why it was not ready. There would be further reminders and it would not be until later that the withholding subsidy of would be considered.<br><br>
The amount of subsidy withheld would be perhaps 5 per cent or 10 per cent—enough to interest the local authority in at least providing the information if it had it, and if it did not have it, in explaining why not and seeking a proper estimate. That is wholly reasonable and in the long run in the interests of both sides—the local authorities and the Exchequer—and is the proper way to conduct the financial affairs of both. Subsidy should be paid according to the rules set out and within which both should be working.<br><br>
The clause aims to ensure that.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he had difficulty understanding our point on amendment No. 162. It relates to that part of subsection (8C) which ends,
<br><blockquote><p>"for that purpose such criteria as he considers relevant".</p></blockquote>
The amendments would at least limit in some way the words "any criteria", because they give to the Secretary of State omnipotent, uncontrolled and ill-defined powers. We had some assurance that those powers would be used sparingly, but that docs not encourage us too much. The relationship between local and central Government has deteriorated continually over the past 10 years, so we want to ensure that there is an orderly system. Such a system cannot operate if protracted and unreasonable delays are created by one side or the other. But all the ammunition is on one side and unlimited powers are given to the Government. Local authorities are being hounded, and are being treated in the way that the police treat recidivist criminals. Such a relationship seems to be behind the Government's neurotic need to take unlimited powers in the Bill. We are trying to ensure that good reason is necessary so that we do not create Ministers with powers of a Caligula.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but it is not as one-sided as he says. The Government provide the money and the local authorities provide the information. The one relies on the other and is in the hands of the other. The Secretary of State does not have an unfettered power. His duty is clear and is subject to the requirement that his power is reasonably used. The local authorities and their associations would not be slow to take action if they thought that the Secretary of State was using his powers unreasonably. That is a real protection because no Secretary of State would want to get into that position. There is every incentive for him to lean over backwards to ensure that this is done fairly. The local authorities have every opportunity to come up with the information in good time. That is all he wants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all entertained by that fantasy. The Government get all the power and the local authority gets all the blame. In the words of Mr. Speaker, "Isn't it all a terrible shame?" I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 159, in page 8, line 35, after 'period', insert
<br><blockquote><p>"or such longer period as may be agreed between the Secretary of State and the authority".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 160, in page 8, leave out lines 39 to 42.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 159, like amendment No. 158, deals with the power of the Secretary of State to estimate the amount of subsidy payable where the authority fails to carry out the prescribed procedures in time. I am encouraged by some of the Minister's remarks when we amended the Government's amendment that he may regard favourably this amendment, or at least the principle that it sets out. All that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 774</span>
we want is to introduce flexibility by allowing a local authority to negotiate an extended deadline if a problem arises. The amendment is simple and should commend itself to the Government.<br><br>
Amendment No. 160 would delete subsection 30(8D) which confers unreasonable powers on the Secretary of State. It states:
<br><blockquote><p>"If an authority fails to make a claim for subsidy within such a period as the Secretary of State considers reasonable, he may withhold from them such part of the subsidy as he thinks fit for so long as he thinks fit."</p></blockquote>
So the Secretary of State can decide what is a reasonable period, which could presumably be longer or shorter than the period described, how much of the subsidy to withhold for as long as he likes and he does not have to give any reason for his actions, yet the Minister says that he does not have sweeping powers!<br><br>
Such a subsection is unnecessary because a local authority that refuses to claim housing benefit subsidy will obviously not receive any subsidy until an estimate has been made. There is no reason why a local authority should wilfully refuse to claim. The Secretary of State would not be obliged to make an estimate. He could keep an authority waiting for as long as he likes before making an estimate without the powers in subsection 30(8D). He could use whatever criteria under subsection 30(8C) as he considers relevant, so there is not much risk of him making an overestimate. The powers in subsection 30(8D) are unnecessary and should be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 159 would enable the Secretary of State to agree with an authority an extension beyond the prescribed period for making a claim, or providing information, before he considered estimating subsidy. Amendment No. 160 would remove the power for the Secretary of State to withhold subsidy from an authority which had failed to make a claim at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When he felt like it.</span></p>
<p>6.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He would have no power to withhold it if the local authority made no claim at all.<br><br>
The "prescribed period" referred to in subsection (8C) would be a period within which it would normally be reasonable to expect an authority to provide evidence in support of its subsidy claim. As I said to the hon. Member for Newport, West I accept that there will be occasions on which an authority has good reasons for being unable to make a claim, or for being unable to provide all the information needed to make a calculation of subsidy due to them.<br><br>
An obvious example is where an authority is seeking to overcome computer difficulties. I agree that it would be entirely proper to take account of such factors and to have regard to the individual circumstances of an authority before concluding that the only reasonable course of action was to make an estimate. Therefore, I am content that the deadline should be extended in appropriate cases and I accept the principle of the amendment. However, I wish to think about the wording to ensure that it succeeds in doing what it should do.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 775</span>
which I hope is what the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) intends it to do.<br><br>
I cannot accept amendment No. 160 which removes subsection (8D) from the clause. That subsection enables the Secretary of State to hold back subsidy until an authority makes a claim.<br><br>
Authorities are expected to claim by the end of October, and provide the necessary information and evidence in support of their claim; although, in certain circumstances, some may be in a position where they have to make the claim with incomplete information and we hope that they could then povide full information as soon as possible.<br><br>
It is clearly important that authorities should not hold back their claims for longer than is absolutely necessary. Hon. Members know that authorities receive substantial payments on account of subsidy, in instalments during the year. Sometimes they will be out of pocket, so there will be a great incentive for them to make a claim, and at other times, they will be in pocket, so there will be less incentive. The Secretary of State should have the power to withhold subsidy where no claim has been made.<br><br>
It is not unusual for an authority to be found to have received total payments in excess of its subsidy entitlements at the end of the year. By the end of October, it has held those sums for a considerable period. Therefore, the Government consider it sensible for the Secretary of State to have the power to require a claim to be made even if every detail cannot be provided.<br><br>
The Public Accounts Committee was rightly critical of authorities that persistently delay their claims and recommended that the Department take action in those cases. We share that concern and intend to take the action set out in the Bill.<br><br>
I ask the Committee to reject the amendment No. 160. I hope that the hon. Lady will not press amendment No. 159 because the intention behind it has merit, and we shall try to find words that fit accurately into the Bill to give that effect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister accepts the principle of amendment No. 159. We remain worried about whether subsection (8D) gives the Government powers that are too sweeping. Having failed to persuade the Government not to make non-existent retrospective legislation, we must be content. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 161, in page 8, line 46, at end add
<br><blockquote><p>"but no such adjustment shall be made by way of a reduction of the amount payable for any year later than the year following that in which the mistake occurred".</p></blockquote>
I am a bit apprehensive about taking time on this amendment because my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has passed this terse language along. When she gets to me she starts using adjectives.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am certain that the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) would not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 776</span>
use rought language in this Committee, just as I am certain that no other member of the Committee would use it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The proposed new section 30(8E) of the 1986 Act will mean that authorities will not know when subsidies are to be recovered and will find it difficult to plan effectively for future years. Moreover, the power that the clause will give the Secretary of State will be too wide. Will it cover errors caused by overworked civil servants? The Minister said earlier that he will not withdraw the Government amendment. I should like to recount a recent case, which he will find painful as he holds dear to his heart transitional payments and housing benefits.<br><br>
A woman came to my office in December. She had written to the transitional payments office in June. I wrote to that office in December and received a letter that illustrates how chaotic the situation is. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I refer to my letter of 7 December 1988 concerning your constituent Mrs. Jean Blackwood of 85 Longstone Road, Cranhill… Mrs. Blackwood's application was received by the Unit on 6 June 1988. An enquiry form TP3, which requests details of pre and post April Housing Benefit, was sent to Glasgow District Council"—</p></blockquote>
which is responsible for housing benefit—
<br><blockquote><p>"…This form has yet to be returned to the Unit, despite a reminder being issued. The information necessary to calculate Mrs. Blackwood's transitional payment was obtained by telephone on 9 December. I am pleased to say that Mrs. Blackwood is entitled to a transitional payment of £1.40 per week from 4 April 1988. I am arranging for a payment to be issued urgently to Mrs. Blackwood which will include arrears from 4 April. Future payments will be made four-weekly in arrears.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I apologise for the delay in replying and hope you find this reply helpful".</p></blockquote>
The following is a letter that I received from my constituent this week:
<br><blockquote><p>"I would Hike to thank you for your help in the past"—</p></blockquote>
it is like the Esther Rantzen show—
<br><blockquote><p>"with regard to a Transitional Payment that you got for me. the amount being £1.40 per week from April 1988 until 7th December 1988.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>According to the above office I am not on their records as receiving any payment and have never received any payment—in other words they do not know my circumstances.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>According to them I am getting most of my rent and rates paid for me, which I am not. I enclose a form from the Transitional Payments to prove that as from 1st April 1988 until 12th April 19881 did receive these payments. (I enclose a copy which I sent to the Transitional Office).</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>According to them I was receiving the payments stated on this form which I was not."</p></blockquote>
Glasgow district council, which is responsible for housing benefits, wrote the following letter to Mrs. Blackwood:
<br><blockquote><p>"I refer to your letter of 9 February 1989, and would advise you as follows:—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Housing Benefit letters were issued to you in June advising of Housing Benefit change from 12 April 1988, when your Supplementary Benefit was stopped, you should also have received a Notice of Proceedings in June at which time you should have been interviewed by the arrears section in order to make the appropriate arrangements.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>In October another letter was issued to you advising you of new benefits … I have contacted our Transitional Payments Section with regard to your payments, but they have no record of having received any, you should therefore take this up with Department of Social Security".</p></blockquote>

Such a situation worries us, and tabled the amendment in response to those fears. Just imagine all the mistakes and wrong calculations in housing support grant. That measure was a mistake in its own right, but local authorities will appeal.<br><br>
On the general fund contribution, we wonder how local authorities will survive. The Secretary of State —just one person—will have powers to withdraw subsidy. The officials involved are those in your Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is the Minister's Department.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, of course. A great deal of strain has been put on the people in the Minister's Department who are dealing with the issue, in particular as a result of the burden imposed by the poll tax. The change in legislation has increased the number of accounts from about 10 million to about 38 million. The staff become harassed and we cannot blame them for mistakes.<br><br>
I have given only one case, but there are many others. It is important that the clause is amended. Our amendment is clear and the Minister should understand it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) on the way in which he moved his amendment. I am sorry that he spoke so late in the afternoon, but I am glad that my hon. Friend the Minister came back in time to hear him. On this Bill, my hon. Friend is specialising in transitional payments which we shall discuss later. If the hon. Member for Provan wants a response on his complicated case I hope that he will pass his documents to us. So that my hon. Friend can make an equally great impact in Committee, I shall advise him to have his notes copied on the large photocopier.<br><br>
The Department expects and intends to correct any mistake on subsidy as soon as the error is discovered. It is just as important for the interests of the local authority, as it is for the interests of the Department that subsidy is adjusted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister does not realise that I have bad eyesight. Some people are short-sighted and some are long-sighted. I need big print and I usually have larger print than this, but there is not enough room to stretch the paper.<br><br>
I take it that the Minister agrees with us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not only agreeing with the general sentiments of the hon. Member for Provan, but going much further. His amendment would limit the period within which the Secretary of State could recover overpaid subsidy to the year following that in which the mistake occurred. However he will be required indefinitely to make good underpayments.<br><br>
The Bill goes further and ensures that overpayments and underpayments are put right not just in the next year but in subsequent years when the information comes to light. We wish the accounts to be correct both ways, not just on one side.<br><br>
I cannot accept the amendment. It would allow
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 778</span>
indefinitely a correction in a local authority's interests, but it would limit the correction of a mistake where a local authority was overpaid. Both errors should be made good. It is just as important that the Exchequer pays out subsidy only when information justifies it as it is that the local authority receives the right subsidy. There should be equity between the two.<br><br>
Despite the arguments of the hon. Member for Provan, I ask my hon. Friends to reject it.</span></p>
<p>6.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister has at last seen the light. Although I have handed my case to him, I hope that he will not interfere in my constituency and stand against me at the next election. I shall be grateful for all the help he can give me.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with the erosion of transitional protection. This is one of the many areas of recent social security legislation where the impression that the Government have succeeded in creating is very different from the reality.<br><br>
Transitional protection was the basis of the eroneous claims made by the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister that 80 per cent of all individual claimants would be better off, or no worse off, after the April 1988 package of social security changes. That was never true and it is not true today. Unfortunately, the erosion of transitional protection makes it more evidently untrue to many claimants.<br><br>
The immediate effect of transitional protection was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0452">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 779</span>
that people did not have their benefit uprated in April 1988 and were worse off in real terms. Once transitional protection has been institued, it will, almost by definition, be eroded as time goes by. That means that not merely at the point of transfer did many people find while their bills increased their benefits did not, but that that will continue in the coming year and, in the worst cases, for many years. That does not happen only at the date of uprating. It is not an annual defect. People can begin to lose their transitional protection at any time, because the regulations provide that it is to be reduced by the amount of any increase in the claimant's applicable amount—the underlying benefit—to which the claimant is entitled.<br><br>
The underlying entitlement can increase for several reasons. One is the annual uprating. That means that those whose bills have increased substantially may not have a rise in benefit. Another example is a rise in mortgage interest rates. Because that is taken into account when calculating income support, it counts as part of a person's underlying entitlement. So if a person's entitlement to a payment for mortgage interest increases because the demand for mortgage interest has increased, the extra amount comes off the claimant's transitional protection, leaving the total benefit unchanged. Indeed, sometimes it wipes out the claimant's entitlement to transitional protection altogether.<br><br>
If the increase in the mortgage payment does not erode all the benefit, and if interest rates fall and the demand for a payment for mortgage interest falls, the transitional protection will not rise. It will remain at the eroded level. That means that the person's total income will fall. Many people who have had increased demands for mortgage payments this year are not receiving anymore benefit and if mortgage payments fall, they will be no better off. Since the changes, some people may have taken out a second mortgage to pay for essential home improvements. In those cases, the losses will be much greater. The Disability Alliance has received reports of people who have lost £20 a week. The Child Poverty Action Group has received a report of a disabled man who received a transitional payment of £17 a week. His mortgage interest rose by £13 a week so his transitional payment was reduced to £4.<br><br>
The general effect of the changes seems unfair, but they do not apply in the same way to someone living in rented accommodation. This is one of the few occasions when someone living in rented accommodation is not as, or more, harshly treated as someone receiving support for his mortgage interest payments. If someone is living in rented accommodation, his income support is not affected by changes in his rent and his housing benefit may be increased. However, as mortgage interest is taken into account through income support that can penalise the owner-occupier.<br><br>
Apart from the changes in mortgage interest, which erode transitional protection, there are other examples of hardship. The Child Poverty Action group gives an example of a single parent who recieved a transitional payment of £5.50 a week. She had a 10-year-old child in care and as a normal part of a programme for such a child—<i>[Interruption.]</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I realise that it is getting late
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 780</span>
but will all hon. Members please listen to the hon. Lady?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful, Mr. McWilliam. The 10-year-old child went home as part of a programme to re-establish him in the family. That is normal and is beneficial not only to the child and the family but to the public purse, as it saves money if the child and family are reunited. Because the child went home after the award of the origianl transitional addition, the underlying benefit entitlement—the family's applicable amount—rose by £10.75 when the child was at home. A week later the child went back into care, which is the normal procedure. The benefit was reduced by the full £10.75. That not only removed the transitional addition but left the mother with a new benefit payment of £5.50 a week less than she had received before the child went home. If she had not reported that to the Department of Social Security and the child had stayed for six months or so, she would have received a substantial overpayment, which the Department would have been entitled to recover.<br><br>
The Disability Allowance has the example of a severely mentally handicapped woman of 33 with a mental age of about four. Her income support and supplementary benefit calculations were based on her spending three days at home and four days in hospital because that was the pattern of her care when the award was made. Shortly after the review took effect, she began to spend an extra day at home. Whenever she spent an extra day at home over and above the pattern set in April 1988, her income support applicable amount—her underlying benefit—increased just for that week and whenever she spent an extra day at home, her transitional addition was reduced by the same amount, which was £5.46. By the end of May she was no longer entitled to any transitional addition although she had started with a transitional addition of £26.43. That case went to a social security tribunal, which did not have the power to change the decision. Although it considered whether her return to hospital every time could be regarded as an admission, it felt that it could not use the law in that way. The chairman of the tribunal commented that it could hardly have been contemplated that regulation 14 should bite in that way.<br><br>
My final example is of someone discharged from hospital after an admission lasting over six weeks. Again, his income support was reduced and on discharge, the rate of income support was restored to the normal rate. For a single person that means a change from the £8.25 hospital rate to £33.40. Again, that is seen as an increase in terms of a transitional addition of that person's applicable amount of £25.15, so any transitional addition received to date is likely to be cut or obliterated by that amount.<br><br>
In the different areas where transitional protection exists but is being eroded very rapidly, we seek to persuade the Government to recognise the speed and harshness with which their pledge that no one would be worse off has been abandoned. We also want to determine whether there is any possibility of at least reducing the rate at which people are losing out as a result of the changes in the benefit system.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Social Security and the Disabled (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the clause is to make financial provision for the extra statutory system of transitional protection. I understand why the hon. Lady should have devoted the amendments and her arguments to the statutory protection under the income support transitional protection.<br><br>
The Committee will be aware that these three amendments would add further exceptions to the rules governing the erosion of transitional protection, meaning that certain increases due to changes of circumstances did not result in a loss of addition, while others did. I have some sympathy with the targets of the amendments. Nevertheless, for broader reasons I shall advise the Committee not to accept them.<br><br>
When we set up the system of transitional protection, our aim and commitment was to give cash protection at the point of change to the minority of claimants whose benefit income under the new scheme was lower than under the old. We always made it clear—it was extensively debated on the Floor of the House and in another place—that there was no intention to prolong that transitional protection far into the future, and that it would reduce as new entitlements caught up. That must be right, otherwise we would perpetuate the anomalies and unfairnesses of the old system for an unduly long time.<br><br>
The public and claimants find the concept of transitional protection difficult to understand and the longer it is prolonged, the longer the time during which those difficulties will affect claimants.<br><br>
However, we recognised that certain exceptions to these rules were needed in very special cases, so we built into the regulations easements—for example, for those taking respite care, ard those taking employment training—and neither of these changes of circumstances results in a loss or protection. We also provided special transitional protection for those former supplementary benefit claimants with high domestic assistance costs. Those were not eroded in the normal way but were inflation proofed, that is, they are uprated. The Committee will also be aware that the package of measures that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced will come into force in October to help older and disabled pensioners will not erode protection at the point of introduction.<br><br>
The Committee will recall that when we were debating clause 9, I said that I would carefully examine the protection of people who take a job for a trial period.<br><br>
Amendment No. 164 would exempt increases in applicable amounts due to changes in housing costs—primarily fluctuations in the mortgage interest rate. Amendment No. 165 would go further and exempt increases due to "regular and frequent" changes of address. Amendment No. 166 is less than clear but it would introduce special rules for anyone who has been temporarily absent from home for whatever reason. It fails to define what is meant by "temporarily absent".<br><br>
I have sympathy for the intentions behind the amendments but I cannot support them. The erosion of transitional protection by increases in normal entitlement is an important principle. Fairness and simplicity were two major aims of the reforms and every excep-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 782</span>
tion to this principle adds complexity to the scheme and creates disparity between claimants.<br><br>
I invite the Committee to reject the amendments.</span></p>
<p>7 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the clause was intended to protect benefits at the point of change and that that must be right. His argument seemed to be that claimants find transitional protection difficult to understand and the sooner it disappears the better.<br><br>
I entirely agree that claimants find transitional protection, and the mechanism of its operation, difficult to understand, but they are used to not understanding how the Department of Social Security arrives at their benefits. What they really find difficult to understand is that their bills continue to rise, their benefits do not and yet the Government keep telling them that they are better off. It would assist the Government to enlighten claimants' bewilderment if the Government were prepared to make some concessions that allowed people's benefits to rise so that at least the pace of change is slowed down. People would then find the gap between their experience and the Government's rhetoric less bewildering.<br><br>
The Minister finished by saying that he wanted to maintain the fairness and simplicity of the new scheme, although none of us would contend that the methods of claiming were simpler. That simplicity has been achieved by removing many of the entitlements to benefit that existed before. We had to have transitional protection because even this Government quailed at the prospect of what would have happened if they had introduced their scheme in its full glory last April.<br><br>
However, Opposition Members recognise that the faster the transitional protection is eroded the more apparent it will become to people just how much money the Government have saved at the expense of the most vulnerable people to devote it to those least in need through tax cuts.<br><br>
This is not the last occasion on which we shall press these matters. However, as we shall plainly make no progress with them this evening, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

ever, it is hardly understood although it was introduced in April.<br><br>
Receiving complaints is a daily occurrence. I had one this morning from an elderly lady who discovered for the first time that she would not receive any increase in her pension in the uprating although she had heard the assurances about the great wealth of the average pensioner. There is a case history of people who refuse to believe that because their spouses have died, they have lost their transitional payments—although that was for the difference between supplementary benefit and income support—entirely because of the surviving partner's additional allowances. People refuse to believe that because they spend six weeks in hospital they will be punished by the loss of payments. That is how they see it. If their circumstances have changed because a spouse who was not living at home on April 10 has returned which causes a loss of transitional benefit, they do not understand that either.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) made it clear that transitional protection was a cowardly way for the Government to defer an unpalatable cut.<br><br>
Amendment No. 167 refers to the arrangement for transferring boarders to housing benefit—another gathering storm that will break in April. Many boarders will be worse off on a combination of income support and housing benefit than they were under the present rules, which provided board and lodging charges as part of income support.<br><br>
From 10 April 1989, another black Monday, claimants on income support who live in board and lodging accommodation will experience considerable changes to their benefit entitlement. At present, they receive an amount of income support which, in theory, is at least enough to pay for their accommodation and any meals not provided, plus a small allowance for personal expenses. From April, boarders will receive the same income support entitlement as other claimants plus housing benefit towards their rent. However, in many cases that will lead to a lower overall benefit entitlement since a substantial proportion of a board and lodging charge is not treated as rent and is not eligible for housing benefit. That ineligible part could be for meals, heating, fuel, cleaning and personal care and support.<br><br>
The forms that are now landing in the homes of landladies and claimants cause bewilderment about how they must be filled in and how the costs will be apportioned. My local DSS office is equally baffled about the way in which the forms should be completed.<br><br>
The Government have recognised that the new system will produce lower benefit entitlements by introducing a system of transitional protection for some claimants who would otherwise lose out in the change. As with all transitional schemes, that will not help new claimants from 10 April 1989. Among the groups facing specific hardship will be a group that occupied our attention on Tuesday—those in supported lodgings, vulnerable people who are placed in lodgings by the social services as part of the care in the community policy—and families with children who have no option
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 784</span>
but to live in bed and breakfast accommodation. The scheme for transitional protection for existing claimants is inadequate and even more limited than the scheme that protected most claimants from the changes in April 1988.<br><br>
The main deificiency is that the protection will be time limited for all claimants except those in supported lodgings and some elderly or disabled claimants. Some families with children will receive protection for 12 months. Those placed in bed and breakfast accommodation by local authorities and those without children will receive only three months' protection unless they are under 25 and previously subject to time limits on boarders staying in any one area, in which case there will be no protection.<br><br>
There is no justification for those arbitrary time limits. The transitional protection given to claimants who lost out under the introduction of income support in April 1988 continues indefinitely for almost all claimants until there is a change of circumstances. Despite the injustice and confusion in that, at least it is better than what is on offer under this provision. Few claimants choose to have board and lodging. It is not an easy option, but is usually the only one available, it is crazy that people who have no home and have lost out all the way should be treated in a way that discriminates against them, and which may result in them being unable to gain access even to board and lodging. Those difficulties are increasing.<br><br>
There will be limited transitional payments, but the groups that will suffer are the young unemployed, who have the status of the lowest pariahs in the Government's eyes and seem to be singled out for unfair treatment—we met some of them on Tuesday. Amend nent No. 167 would remove that totally unjustified and unnecessary discrimination. It is not a radical proposal, but it would give limited protection for a short period.<br><br>
Amendment No. 168 would extend the duration of transitional payments for boarders under the new arrangements commencing in April from 13 to 52 weeks, which would be a considerable improvement. The Government intend that families with children in board and lodging accommodation not provided by the local authority will be protected for 52 weeks and for others the maximum will be 13 weeks. Why 13 weeks? Severe hardship will be caused by forcing people to leave accommodation in which they may have lived for many years. It is disruptive for anyone to leave home, and to do so under these conditions would be deeply disturbing. Some of those affected will almost certainly be elderly or disabled. There is a limited exemption for those in need of personal care and living in accommodation arranged for them by a local authority or a voluntary body, but it does not extend to the slightly more fortunate people who have made their own arrangements.<br><br>
We would prefer transitional protection to be extended without limit, at least to the elderly and disabled, and amendment No. 168 would give those people a year's respite, and we hope that the Government will review the effects of the April 1989 changes and take whatever steps are necessary to relieve any hardship caused by them. All of us in the House are aware
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0455">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 785</span>
of the widespread unease at the effects of the changes, and at a meeting that took place just before Christmas hon. Members of all parties and outside bodies united in expressing their unhappiness at the disruptive effect of the changes.<br><br>
Amendment No. 169 again refers to boarders. Any boarder entitled to transitional payment under the changes will lose that protection if he or she moves. It is difficult to explain the change, because people simply refuse to believe why they are losing their transitional payment. They see no sense or justice in it. They lose it, even if, for whatever reason, they move to similar accommodation where the board and lodging charge is exactly the same. Someone might have died; the place might have closed; perhaps the landlady decided to move after many years and the boarders moved with her. In all such cases, the boarders automatically lose transitional protection.<br><br>
The same is true of someone who moves to similar accommodation in another part of the country, possibly in the futile quest of actively seeking work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does it not also show a contradiction in Government policy? The Government advocate portable pensions, but they do not advocate portable transitional protection.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a splendid point. It is an example of the discrimination that pervades the Government's thinking. It would be nice to have portability in transitional payments. Even if a person is so wild, abandoned and dissipated as to go off on a week's holiday in Skegness, he changes his accommodation and loses the payment. It is not even portable enough to take account of that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 169 would delete the paragraph of schedule 3A that says that the protected sum shall cease to be applicable if the claimant changes or leaves his accommodation. It is an entirely onerous, harsh and unfair condition. I understand that, if amendment No. 169 were accepted, consequential changes would need to be made to the regulations, but I am sure that they could be incorporated when the Minister announces that he will accept the amendment and those grouped with it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I believe that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) described the transitional payments scheme as cowardly. I find it difficult to accept that description, when we know that a considerable majority either gained from, or were unaffected by, the changes that were introduced in April 1988. A minority would have suffered a cliff-edge drop in their entitlement at that point because we were concerned to get away from the complexities of the old supplementary benefit scheme and move to a scheme that was much more simple, straightforward, easier for staff, and easier for claimants to understand. We introduced a system of transitional protection to ease what the hon. Gentleman later called the disruption caused by the change in the system. I believe that we took the right step, but I repeat the anxiety that I expressed on the previous amendment to see that the complexities and difficulties of understanding transitional protection are not projected into the future.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 786</span>
The amendments involve payments to people in hotels, guest houses and other types of board and lodging accommodation. They would alter the award and duration of transitional payments to protect the income of the majority of boarders when special payments of income support for this group are replaced by normal income support and housing benefit in April. The overall effect of the amendments would be twofold. First, all boarders would be eligible for transitional payments for up to 52 weeks without any regard to their individual circumstances. Secondly, those payments would continue even when the claimant changed address.<br><br>
7.15 pm<br><br>
It is worth reminding the Committee that the provision of special benefit rates for boarders has had a troubled history throughout its existence under the supplementary benefit scheme. Special rates of benefit encouraged claimants to seek such accommodation, often at prices that those in work could not afford. Some proprietors of hotels and guest houses took advantage of the higher rates payable and advertised for DSS clientele. As a result, the number of boarders increased dramatically with correspondng escalation in public expenditure. In one two-year period, expenditure trebled. Of particular concern were young people trapped in expensive and often inappropriate accommodation for long periods, with no incentive to seek employment.<br><br>
Changes were introduced in 1985 which halted the rapid growth in numbers and in expense. Although those claimants were similar to other claimants, they received markedly different rates of benefit. They lived in similar accommodation, had similar characteristics, but the rules for calculating their benefits were different. They depended on their landlord sometimes providing them with a meal, but often that meal was a token offering, such as a loaf of bread for breakfast for a week. A minority provided no meal at all, but still qualified by devices such as hanging up a sign saying, "Guest House" outside the front door of the premises being used.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why the Minister keeps talking about that. When the regulations were introduced, we said that that would happen. We are against the Government proposing endlessly the most dotty reforms, paying no attention to them when they are going through and then, instead of taking action against offenders, roughing up the claimants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are seeking to produce a new system that gets away as quickly as possible from the anomalies that were apparent under the old supplementary benefit scheme, which led people receiving broadly the same treatment and having the same characteristics as others, but yet being treated differently.<br><br>
The majority of boarders who stand to lose benefit will be protected for up to three months provided that they continue to reside at the same address. Families not sponsored by a local authority will receive protection for up to one year. The most vulnerable group)—those elderly or disabled people cared for by their landlady—will be protected for as long as they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0456">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 787</span>
continue to receive such care, irrespective of whether they change address.<br><br>
Young people under the age of 25 are currently paid the special board and lodging rates for only a limited period unless they belong to a vulnerable group, such as those unable to work through disability. Rather than offering this group transitional protection within the same limited period, we decided that it would be more sensible simply to end the existing time-limits.<br><br>
The overall aim of the reforms to be introduced in April is to make the social security scheme neutral as to the type of accommodation occupied by claimants. That should be welcomed. The transitional payments arrangements I have described strike the right balance between giving claimants time to adjust to the new arrangements and removing the perverse incentives in the present scheme for landlords to provide, and for claimants to seek, lodgings with markedly different arrangements for paying benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the benefit system to be neutral, but the housing system is not neutral. The Minsiter talks about young people being trapped in expensive bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Often, they do not choose that, but there is nothing else available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are placed there.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, sometimes they are placed there. For many, whatever chance they had of getting out of such accommodation disappeared when the Government abolished single payments for furniture, or made it difficult for people to get them. Even if they were lucky enough to get an unfurnished council flat they could not move into it. It is misleading to suggest that the problem is outside the Government's control and that nothing they have done has contributed to it.<br><br>
Some people will face losses because of the changes. Although the personal allowances paid to some people after April might be higher, those increases will often be less then the meals payments that will stop altogether. On top of that, some elements of the charges will cease to be taken into account.<br><br>
We have consulted the groups that deal with homeless families who live in such unfortunate circumstances and would like nothing better than to get out of that situation, especially in the Field lane homeless family centre and the Bayswater hotel. The larger the family the greater the loss they are likely to experience from these changes. A family with five children in the Field lane centre will lose £50.60 despite the transitional arrangements which the Minister described with such warmth and enthusiasm.<br><br>
The Department argues that such families do not require compensation for the loss of meals payments. It assumes that homeless people living in hotels have access to cookers and have the same facilities to prepare their meals as families with proper homes. That is totally untrue. Many hotels have no facilities, and some have insufficient facilities or limit their use to an hour a day. It is unrealistic to expect families to prepare meals in such circumstances.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 788</span>
I have no idea—I do not suppose that the Minister has either—how people in those circumstances will manage when the Government simplify the system yet again this year. However, I am certain that it will not be long before radio and television programmes and press articles—even our indifferent press—will be asking, 'isn't it terrible that this is happening? How did it come about?" We know how it came about—the Government are saving money again.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are unhappy with the response to our amendment. The question of transitional payments is a volcano waiting to erupt. The Minister has again shown how the Government are trapped by their belief in a tabloid mythology. It is a shame that the technicolour publicity for alleged abuse when young people got on their bikes and went to Brighton some years ago has left a permanent scar on the Government's memory. They act punitively against some of the most vulnerable young members of society.<br><br>
The Minister said that certain groups such as the disabled and the elderly will be protected. But it is limited to those groups which are in local authority care or have been transferred to lodging houses by local authorities. Many more people are in a different group. The idea of young Liverpudlians living it up on the DSS in Brighton is long past. Those lodging houses are miserable places in which people live a rather sad half-life. It is sad that the Government could not have extended a little generosity to them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is a purely technical one enabling the expenses of the scheme to be paid for out of moneys voted by Parliament. I do not blame the Opposition for having debated several matters under various amendments, but I presume that they would not wish to vote against this technical clause.</span></p>
