	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are talking about housing benefit, and the forms of payments and deductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with uprating and deductions—non-dependant deductions. When the amendment was first tabled, it was suggested that it would increase the one parent premium in the housing benefit scheme this April in line with inflation, from £8.60 to £9.20 a week. If I were tabling the amendment today, I would be tempted to go for a higher figure, as this figure is only in line with present inflation. We are having difficulty in keeping up with the Government's attempts to lower inflation. 1 understand that it is not only the Committee's difficulty; recently there were difficulties on the Floor of the House over the issue, so I make no apology. Therefore, we shall stick to our figure for the purposes of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the pre-1988 housing benefit scheme, the needs allowance for single parents was the same at that for couples with children, which reflected the view that their needs were similar. Under the new scheme, difficulties occurred when housing benefit and income support were aligned with what the Government called applicable amounts. After the Fowler review the Green Paper on "Reform of Social Security" stated that for lone parents
	<br><blockquote><p>"alignment would require particularly careful attention"—</p></blockquote>
Since there was no similar special provision for their needs in the supplementary benefit scheme. It was suggested that the proposed family premium and lone parent premium in the income support scheme would
	<br><blockquote><p>"help to meet these concerns".</p></blockquote>
When we pressed for further detail on how that would work in practice, the Government's White Paper of December 1985 included illustrative rates of benefit for
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
the lone parent premium, which turned out to be only £3.45 per week. The White Paper went on to acknowledge that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Government additionally proposed that one parent benefit should be disregarded in the calculation of housing benefit."</p></blockquote>
In fact that did not happen. Instead, a higher lone parent premium of £8.60 was introduced for housing benefit, compared with a £3.70 lone parent premium in the income support scheme. The difference between those figures is £4.90, which is precisely the rate of one parent benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, for a family which receives one parent benefit of £4.90 a week, it makes no significant difference whether the £4.90 is disregarded in calculating housing benefit, or whether an extra £4.90 is added to the lone parent premium. Either way, the gap between the family's needs and its income is widened by the figure, and its benefit entitlement is increased accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in relation to the Government's overriding objective of cutting the cost of benefits, it makes a difference. To disregard the one parent benefit means that every time the benefit is uprated the housing benefit disregard will also increase. When the £4.90 is added to the lone parent premium for housing benefit purposes, it enables the Government to argue that the addition is only a transitional measure, and that, like other transitional payments, it does not need to be uprated annually. They can argue that it can be allowed to be eroded by inflation, or—as with child benefit—frozen and eventually phased out altogether. There has been a shift away from the principle and original intentions of the Green Paper and from the clear commitment in the White Paper, which gave the illustrative rates, towards transition. Is that what the Government intended? That is what has happened in practice. People have lost out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The adviser to the Association of Metropolitan Authorities commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An important side issue is the alleged 'transitional' nature of the differential. The AM A has asked the DSS for chapter and verse as to when it was first stated that this provision was transitional. We suspect the introduction of a new concept of "retrospective transitionality'."</p></blockquote>
That is a heavy phrase to handle at this time in the morning but, to put it in plainer English, it seems that if the Government decide to make a cut they suggest that this is not a permanent and proper arrangement but simply a temporary measure. What is even worse, they do so after the event. People will lose out as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a good case for a higher lone parent premium in the housing benefit scheme. Those who would benefit from it would be lone parents whose income is above income support level because they have part-time work and are likely to have higher work expenses than married couples, particularly child care expenses. As no allowance is made for those expenses in calculating their housing benefit, the lone parent premium would go some way towards to filling that gap. In practice, it should remain at least at the present level in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 151 deals with the deductions for non-dependants that are currently made under the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
housing benefit income support schemes. Some Conservative Members did not know that people do not get 100 per cent, assistance with their rent and rates. We are therefore having to spell it out at length that people do not receive it, because last year the Government introduced a rule that everyone must pay a minimum 20 per cent, contribution to their rates. At most they get 80 per cent, assistance. Interestingly, deductions for non-dependants are not made under the mortgage interest tax relief scheme. People who are helped with their housing costs in the form of mortgage interest tax relief are not penalised, whereas others, who are dependent on housing benefit, are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deductions for non-dependants are made in the case of grown-up children who still live at home and elderly relatives who live in the claimant's household. Those deductions have been increased in real terms in recent years and have become a substantial burden on the claimant's family. Our amendment would remove them from the housing benefit scheme. From April 1989, a top rate of £9.15 a week from non-dependants will be levied in respect of rent and mortgage interest payments from income support and £3.35 in respect of rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key issue is whether the deductions made from the parents' benefit, or the children's benefit in the case of an elderly relative, based on assumptions about the contributions made by those non-dependants, are fair and realistic. The Social Security Advisory Committee thinks that they are not. When the deductions were increased in April 1984 the SSAC commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We think it is entirely right that non-dependants living in a beneficiary's household should be expected to make a contribution to housing costs. We are concerned, however, that these increases have gone far beyond what is fair and realistic and that there will be circumstances in which it is not reasonable to expect the non-dependant to pay a contribution of as much as £8.20."</p></blockquote>
The broad issue here is whether it is right that the Government should penalise parents, regardless of whether they receive contributions from their children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents have no legal means of collecting such money from their sons, daughters or other relatives; it depends on goodwill and family spirit. We should not superimpose on that goodwill and family spirit a financial burden which will mean that people begin to regard their non-dependants as a burden on the family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People will be pushed out of their homes. Earlier, the Government said that it was better for people to live at home than to look for hard-to-find and hard-to-pay-for accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the April 1989 increase in non-dependant deductions is about 12 per cent., which is much higher than the figure referred to when the Social Security Advisory Committee made its remark about the figure being unfair and unrealistic. The Government have tried to justify that figure by arguing that it represents the housing costs component of the retail price index. There is no logic in that, because it is the non-dependant's likely ability to pay which is at stake. That figure is just a poor disguise for even more cuts in housing benefit. It is a pound-pinching exercise at the margins of social security and will have adverse effects.
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
If deductions for non-dependants are to remain, a more relevant uprating index should reflect movements in the income of non-dependants. Non-dependants on low incomes should be able to claim housing benefit. However, we want to deal with the question of whether any deductions should be imposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Deductions can cause considerable hardship, either to the non-dependant in trying to meet them or to the claimant when housing benefit is not paid. The deductions can sour relationships and cause families to split up. I recommend Committee members to read a booklet published a few years ago called "Families rent apart." It is a study of young people's contributions to their parents' housing costs. I shall not take up the Committee's time by going through all the cases set out in that booklet, but they are not simply one-off cases, they are real problems. The booklet was based on research carried out by the Child Poverty Action Group and Youth Aid in 1984 when the deductions for non-dependants were lower in real terms than they are now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One parent wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"As my two boys are on a low wage. I could not possibly ask them for any more money. I am scared they may leave home and that's the last thing I want to happen."</p></blockquote>
Another parent would not ask for the £8.20 because
	<br><blockquote><p>"this would cause friction and drive them away from home to become one of the numerous homeless persons."</p></blockquote>
A pensioner wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I was informed if my son was not at home I would have no rent to pay … I do think it is all wrong to have to pay for your sons and daughters to live at home after bringing them up. What do I do. make him get married?"</p></blockquote>
People should not be priced out of their homes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, we discussed low pay and the Minister expressed incredulity at the figures that we mentioned. After a radio programme on wages councils, a woman came to me and said that her son had been offered such a low wage by a supermarket that she did not believe that that was the rate offered by the supermarket. She thought that he was simply conning her because he did not want to make the full contribution to the household costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government assume that the non-dependant's contribution will be made at the high rate that they propose, they will cause real hardship to people on low incomes. It is also bad housing policy. If financial pressure forces young people to move out of the family home, it will encourage inefficient use of the housing stock. In Leeds, the pressure for two and three-bedroom houses is far greater than for one-bedroom houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People then move into one-bedroom flats and create an under-use of three and four-bedroom houses, so there is an escalation of pressure within the housing sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision is bad housing policy and represents a debt engineered by the Government. It will be difficult to administer and will simply add to the already increasing rent and rates arrears. Families will squabble over the rent and rates that they have to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
For those reasons, and in the interests of a clearer simplified system—for which the Government often appeal—it would be sounder policy and elementary justice if non-dependant deductions were brought into line with the mortgage interest tax relief scheme and abolished. That has happened in the case of people who are helped with their housing costs through the mortgage interest tax relief scheme. I hope that the Government will not say that that concerns a different Department—the Treasury. I see a real distinction between those who get interest relief on their mortgages and the increased pressure that is being put on non-dependant contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will accept the two amendments; they do not involve a major change in policy. I am sorry that I have taken up time by going through the arithmetic in detail; some Conservative Members of the Committee feel that we must be careful with our arithmetic. I urge the Minister to respond with care and to take some of the pressure off families who experience real difficulties in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister to respond, may I apologise for the less than adequate service that the printers are giving us. Amendments that were tabled after approximately 8 o'clock last night appear on a separate amendment paper. The Clerk is doing his best to improve the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment Number 151, which the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has just discussed, would increase the amount of the housing benefit lone parent premium by 60p a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We reviewed the value of the lone parent premium at the same time as the other income-related benefits, but decided not to increase it from this April. The lone parent premium was set at a higher level in housing benefit from income support last April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why we did not retain the intention originally expressed in the White Paper and disregard one parent benefit rather than give extra cash by means of the housing benefit lone parent premium. We increased the premium because we realised that many lone parents, such as widows, on housing benefit did not receive one parent benefit. We increased the premium to ensure that all lone parents would benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April 1988, when we introduced the new structure of income-related benefits, we took a deliberate decision to align as many of the rules as possible. This change was widely welcomed because it led to a simpler and more intelligible system and removed the worst effects of the poverty trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether the hon. Gentleman would disagree with such an objective. That meant that lone parents are now assessed as single people—as they are in income support and were in supplementary benefit— not as couples, as they were in the old housing benefit scheme. We recognised, however, that this would give rise to a transitional problem, which is why we set the premium higher. We subsequently made transitional protection available as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
We shall continue to review, as my right hon. Friend is statutorily required to do, the value of all the premiums. However, for the April 1989 uprating we took a deliberate decision to make a step further towards alignment. I believe that that is right because alignment is an important part of the new structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should emphasise several points about that decision. First, it does not affect the poorest people. Those on income support will have seen an increase in their premium, and they will continue to receive maximum housing benefit— protecting them against rent rises if they are tenants. Secondly, those affected by the freeze will not have seen a drop in their income in real terms. Thirdly, and importantly, all lone parents on benefit will have gained significantly from the extra cash we put into the children's rates, not only in income support but also in family credit and housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the right way to provide extra resources for families on lower incomes. Lone parents are also entitled to the higher earnings disregard. I am convinced that that was, and is, the right policy, and I urge my hon. Friends to resist the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle).—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> He is not an hon. Friend, friendly though he is, because Opposition Members are Gentlemen— except, of course those who are Ladies. That reminds me of the strictures of the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) at our previous sitting about the need to give local authorities adequate notice of changes. In all probability—or in all certainty, if the Committee accepted the change—it would have be introduced retrospectively following Royal Assent—a costly and difficult exercise which I do not think local authorities would thank us for. There are ways of improving benefits for lone parents. We demonstrated one of those ways in the last uprating, and future improvements should be carried out along those lines rather than in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 152 would mean maximum housing benefit in all cases would be 100 per cent, of eligible rent and 80 per cent, of eligible rates. No regard would be had in any housing benefit assessment to contributions towards the household's expenses made by non-dependants—people such as grown-up sons and daughters and boarders living in the claimant's household. The hon. Member for Leeds, West will not be surprised to learn that the Government do not support the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always believed that where a claimant has another person living in the household, such as a grown-up son or daughter, it is righ to assume that he or she is contributing towards the household expenses. Within housing benefits, therefore, flat rate non-dependant deductions are made which vary according to the age and financial circumstances of the non-dependant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements introduced last April constitute a fairer and simpler structure than the previous one. In his remarks, the hon. Gentleman did not recognise the changes that have been made. The local authorities should find it easier to administer and we have removed many of the anomalies of the old system. There is a higher and lower rate of deduction for rent as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
before—but the higher is applied to those in full-time work. Previously it was applied to almost everyone not on supplementary benefit. I think that that was what the hon. Gentleman was thinking of. That removed the disincentive to take a part-time job, or to go on a training course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To protect the position of low-paid earners we introduced for the first time an income threshold. Where the non-dependant is in low paid work—earning below £49.20—the claimant is subject to the lower rate of rent deduction. The higher rate of deduction for rents applies only in respect of boarders who are paying a charge fixed by the claimant for services provided and in respect of people earning more than the threshold figure. Where the non-dependant is a 16 or 17-year-old or on a YTS course, no deduction is made, no matter what the young person's income or employment status; and no deduction is made where the claimant or his partner is registered blind or receiving attendance allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When community charge is introduced, the non-dependants' deductions for rates will be obsolete because everyone over 18 will be liable for making their own contribution towards local services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Leeds, West that it is not right to price children out of their parents' home, but children should make a contribution. I also agree with him that an £8.20 deduction for those on low pay is too much. That is why we have set for those on low pay receiving under £49.20, a figure of £3.45 for rent and £3 for rates. It is wholly reasonable that such deductions should, be made, and with an income of at least £49.20 I should think that most children would want, in return for staying in their parents' home, to contribute rather more than the deductions. Rather than causing the parents to drive the children out of the home, it is in the interests of both to stay there—financially, as well as emotionally and for mutual support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Lady wood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should just like to mark something that the Minister said. He said that people on low pay were protected because anyone earning less than £49.20 a week got some special provision. Is £49.20 a week the Minister's definition of low pay? That is the implication of what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not merely the implication; it is the definition of low pay for the non-dependants deductions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr.Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why there is a divisive element in his presentation? If I were an owner-occupier with a mortgage, and I had non-dependants living with me, money from them would not be deducted from the mortgage interest relief. Rather than being a universal rule, only renters are forced to make a contribution. Why are only renters, and not people who are purchasing their homes, put into that category. To follow the logic of the Minister's argument, should not both groups be in it? Is it not unjust to segregate the poplulation in that manner?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is making a debating point and would not want the deduction to be extended to tax relief for mortgage payers. I see a difference between deductions where benefits are paid, and deductions where there is mortgage interest relief. I agree that the hon. Gentleman has a point that could be debated, but I do not think that his intention is to press us to translate the provisions into mortgage interest relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not it is a debating point, it is a real point. Some families who are renters have to pay the money; those who are owner-occupiers with mortgages do not. With respect to the Minister, that makes nonsense of his claim that everybody should make that contribution to the household because that is not the case for the 60 per cent, or so of the population who are owner-occupiers with mortgages.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have answered the hon. Gentleman. I believe that the cases are not similar, and I am sure that he is not pressing us to make them so.

We believe that it is only right and proper to retain the deductions for rents in accordance with the present system which is fair both to the non-dependants themselves and to the tax-payer. Abolishing non-dependant deductions for rent would cost a considerable sum of money—upwards of £200 million—and we believe that that money is better retained in the social security system and spent on those who have no other source of support within the household. I ask my hon. Friends to reject both the amendments if the hon. Member for Leeds, West wishes to press them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the reply that I have received I intend to press them. On amendment No. 152, the Minister introduced the element of the poll tax and that will be a significant factor. When it is introduced, that burden may wipe out people's incomes and contributions. That makes a nonsense of the idea that people are receiving a rebate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

However, a key element is that the provision imposes a penalty on people who rent and receive anything from the state, while people who have a mortgage and receive tax relief are shielded. That is unjust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I responded precisely on mortgage interest relief, but the question is wider. Non-dependant deductions are applied to benefit that is paid to people who have a mortgage to buy their own house, but they do not apply to mortgage interest relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In essence, the Minister is saying that if people are sufficiently poor to be entitled to housing benefit, even after all the cuts that the Government have made to it recently they will be covered by non-dependant deductions. If people have a higher income and do not need housing benefit, they need not worry about their children's income, even though it may be substantial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend sums up the matter accurately and makes the point more firmly than I

	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
could. The Government are creating a two-tier welfare state in which those who are better off receive tax relief, while those who are on benefit are penalised and the little that they have is taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that alignment was a central part of the new structure in the Fowler review. However, the floor for income support generally has been lowered, so people receive less as a result of the alignment. The Social Security Advisory Committee complained that the Government were fixing an unfair and unreasonable level. That level has now been increased. When that is added to the fact that child benefit has been frozen, it means that the income of lone parents is going down. The Minister may say that the Government have evened out the floor and introduced an alignment. In practice, however, when people work out their budget, come to our surgeries and advice sessions and ask us to explain why their income is going down they show us figures which demonstrate that they have less money to cope with purchasing what they need to live on as a result of the alignment, because the alignment is lowering the floor for income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister and Conservative Members to support our amendment and to reconsider the alignment. The floor should be raised a little so that it may return to the level that people expect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept that the floor has been lowered. Lone parents have done well out of the reforms and most of them are now better off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Except those lone parents who constitute most of the people who are caught by the Government's decision not to allow claimants to take account of work expenses in claiming for income support. I cannot recall the exact figures, but when all the provisions for single parents are taken into account, the Government are more likely than lone parents to make a profit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to express the sadness that we all feel at this morning's news of the unexpected death of Sir Raymond Gower. He was the longest-serving Welsh MP and one of the longest-serving Members of the House. Like many other Welsh Members, I was once a constituent of his. He was a most diligent, steadfast and devoted Member. He was also a man of great courtesy and kindness, especially to new Members. The Conservative party has lost one of its most loyal members who, just a few days ago, was working as hard as ever in this House. He has friends in every corner of the House and his passing gives us all a sense of loss and grief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intend to speak to amendment No. 154. We shall not press amendment No. 153. Amendment No. 154 would rectify one of the anomalies which the Government no doubt introduced in their usual innocent way which could well cause injustice. Although the sum of money may seem small, it is a large amount for a family with a tiny disposable income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until April 1988, families receiving family income supplement were entitled to free school meals and welfare milk. That entitlement was abolished when family credit was substituted for family income supplement. The Government claimed that the maximum family credit included an extra £2.55 a week for each child to compensate for the loss of school meals. That figure was based on a national average. There is no similar compensation in housing benefit. It assumes that the family's income needs are the same as when they received income support. Families on income support qualify for free school meals and welfare milk but other families on housing benefit do not. We propose that in calculating housing benefit entitlement, instead of the whole amount of family credit being counted as part of the family's income, there should be a disregard of £2.55 for each child. The effect of the present rules is that when a family claims both family credit and housing benefit, 85 per cent of the £2.55 compensation is clawed back from the housing benefit. That reduces it to a mere 38p, an effective loss of income to those families of £2—a substantial sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) for his kind remarks of sympathy on the death of Sir Raymond Gower. He was a valued colleague. We also appreciated the qualities mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, and we are touched that they are recognised by the Opposition. Our sympathy, and that of the Committee and the whole House, goes to Sir Raymond Gower's family and his constituents, who have lost an excellent Member of Parliament.

Amendment No. 154 seeks to extend the present disregards in schedule 4 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987 to disregard the specific amount included in family credit child credits for school meals and welfare milk. The amount was set at £2.55 in April 1988—based on the national average charge for a fixed price school meal but spread over a whole year rather than just school term time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Family credit is a resource and is taken into account as such in working out entitlement to housing benefit. It is a basic principle that all income is taken into account in income-related benefits. Family credit is a much more generous benefit than its predecessor, family income supplement, and even after the changes in respect of free school meals, free milk and housing benefit, most working families are better off. The poorest families—those on income support—continue to be eligible for free school meals and welfare milk, while working families on low or only modest pay can get compensation for those items through the family credit structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government believes that, for working families, help should be provided in cash rather than in kind. Those in work are able to budget for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cash help is now given automatically in respect of every child covered by family credit, which means that more families get help now than those who were receiving free school meals under family income supplement and the local education authority discretionary schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Did the Minister say that because of the help being given through family credit more families are now getting help with free school meals than received help under family income supplement, when they were entitled as of right to free school meals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recall that around 250,000 low-paid families with children received help under the various local authority discretionary schemes? From memory, I am not even sure that total family credit uptake has yet reached that level. The Minister's comments are inaccurate. They may be the expression of a pious wish, but they are not a description of fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not inaccurate. The hon. Lady should recollect that many children entitled to free school meals under family income supplement did not take them. I do not carry the figures in my head, but I am sure that the figures that I have given are correct in general terms. If the hon. Lady wishes more precise figures, I shall see that she gets them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am quite happy with my figures because they are more accurate than the Minister's. I did not refer to any theoretical number of people who may have taken free school meals under family income supplement. I gave the Minister the figures for families who did take free or lower-priced school meals before
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
the Government got at the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must concede that the figures are for families who are eligible for help, rather than for those who take it up. I concede that theoretical point to the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Newport, West appreciates that family credit is an effective vehicle for bringing help to poorer families, but the amendment would produce an unnecessary complication for local government. It would not give as much help to those paying mortgage interest rather than rent. If extra help is to be given, the Government prefers the means that we have used for the next uprating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that family credit is doing a good job. Why is there less than a 55 per cent, uptake if it is giving help, where necessary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several reasons. It is a new benefit and it takes a long time for people to become familiar with what is available, especially when it is a benefit for families in work which goes a long way up the scale. People do not expect such a benefit to be available and it takes a long time for that information to filter through.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Gentleman in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although in numbers the uptake may not be as high as we originally hoped, in cash terms we are over the expected budget. Therefore, those whom we aimed at squarely—those in work on the lowest incomes—are taking it up and are doing so much more completely than we anticipated. That is good and I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is pleased about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he was disappointed with the uptake. He reckoned that in the first six months, uptake would be as high as 70 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is referring to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, he should note that my right hon. Friend is as pleased as I am that families on the lowest incomes are taking it up to a greater extent than we had expected. I have explained that not everyone is familiar with the benefit; people expect to get benefit only when they are out of work or on extremely low incomes. Family credit goes well up the income scale. We shall shortly begin a television advertising compaign to explain family credit more clearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not Government policy to keep people on low incomes? In Glasgow, 83 per cent, of 125,000 council tenants receive wages of less than £5,000 a year; 74 per cent, of them are receiving benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is moving away from the strict subject of the amendment. That is certainly not the Government's policy, as he suggests. The Government's policy is to get as many people as possible into work. This is the best vehicle for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
economic growth, and as a result better wages will be paid. As 1 said to the hon. Member for Newport, West, if extra help is to be given, we prefer the means we have used for the coming uprating. That is the best way to get money to all those who are entitled to family credit, rather than the way provided in the amendment. The Government cannot accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the Government are doing a wonderful thing in relation to family credit. He said that the amendment would be unnecessarily complicated and implied that local authorities might be unhappy if the Government made such a change. The authorities were very unhappy when the Government took away their discretionary power to provide reduced-price or free school meals more widely than just to those categories to which they were compelled to provide it—people on income support. However, that made no difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the Government are delighted that expenditure on family credit is proving to be higher than anticipated, given the case loads. We are all pleased to hear that, but Opposition Members wonder how long it will last. When the take-up and cost of a benefit are higher than the Government have anticipated, they usually turn round and say that there must be fraud somewhere and they take steps to cut entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am waiting with bated breath to see whether the take-up campaign for family credit will be slightly less determined than we were first told, or whether some other change will be made to cut the level of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that take-up seems to be particularly high among the lowest-paid families. Those are likely to be the families who will be claiming housing benefit. I wonder whether local authorities are compelled to assume that they are drawing family credit— whether they are or not—and to take it into account in calculating their housing benefit. If that is so, they may have to claim family credit. Although we want people to claim it, that is a bone of contention for us, and certainly for many claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister talked about how far family credit goes up the income scale, but it is the net effect of the Government's package of changes on people's incomes that matters. The net effects of the Government's increase in family credit and their enormous cuts in housing benefit are that there is no one on an income of under £100 a week—whether a two-child or three-child family—according to the figures that the Government have reluctantly given us who is not worse off than they were in April 1988 under the old system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year's increases and upratings have had no effect, except that the income of those who are worse off is a little lower. Last year, any one who earned under £120 was worse off than at the point of changeover; this year it is someone who earns under £100 who is worse off at that point. It is ironic for the Minister to talk so much about the beneficial effects of family credit to the lowest-paid when he well knows— the amendment is directed to this point, as my hon. Friend the Minister for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said—that the overall effect of these many changes is to
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
make those people substantially worse off than they were before the Government supposedly improved the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the arguments about simplicity and complexity should fall down now. The problem with the Government's arguments on simplicity is the element of rough justice—the fact that the system must cater for all kinds of human situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can deal with a whole multitude of complexities through a computerised system, far more than one could through the old manual system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department's bitter experience of computerisation, as reported recently by the National Audit Office, might well have reduced some of its enthusiasm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A properly organised, computerised system could deal with any of those complexities. However, the fact that the scheme has to have a crude simplification is not a justification for injustices. The Minister's point that the take-up of family credit is lower, while the amount spent is higher than expected for the numbers, is simply explained by the increased poverty and the increased numbers on low pay. There are more families in dire poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday I was visited by several constituents who were doing skilled, demanding, responsible jobs in the Health. Service, as technicians in cardiology departments or in pharmacies in hospitals; all those who were family earners were on family credit. Those people were doing jobs that demanded professional decisions, yet they were so poorly rewarded that they had to claim family credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We seem condemned to repeat the errors of history. Here we have a repeat of the Speenhamland system in the Berkshire area, a system of support that had the effect of depressing wages. Recently, when the Secretary of State for Employment called for a change in the pay of low pay workers, the change was to be achieved by depressing the wages of the poorest. Those who were earning a low level of wage would earn even less, so that the relative wage of more skilled workers would seem better. Their wage is not increased, but it seems better in real terms. Although we find some contents of the legislation worthwhile, it has that depressant effect on wages and locks people into a system in which there is competition and a downward wages spiral.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not tackled this injustice. The disregard should be available for people claiming family credit and housing benefit, otherwise the £2.55 will be worth not its true value, but 38p. We are disappointed with the Minister's reply. This is a genuine imperfection, and an anomaly in the scheme that was possibly not intended. It results in a substantial impoverishment to these families, who are in considerable need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Family credit goes further up the income scale than family income supplement did. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman could see the benefit that that brings to families on low incomes. If we embarked too much on discussion of the Speenhamland system, you would rightly rule us out of order. Mr. Winterton. Family credit does not produce
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
the faults of that system, as it is designed for families with children. It is not true that there is a general depressant effect on wages. The statistics for pay increases across the country show that there is no sign of that happening yet—indeed, quite the reverse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, local authority discretion over free school meals was mentioned. One of the problems was that many local authorities did not use it, so there was inequality across the country. We believe that the compensation in family credit, which goes to all who claim it and could go to all who are eligible, is much the fairest way of providing that assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed.</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee but I have one question for the Minister. I was struck by a thought when first reading the clause over the Christmas recess—a happy way to spend the time— and it has not been clarified by any of the briefings. Will it be possible under the clause for payment of benefit to be settled without the claimant seeing any cash in his hands? We are talking not just about payments but about rebates and transfers, where money is not passed to an individual. People on very low incomes sometimes find it easier to manage if they receive some cash, no matter how small, so that they can juggle it instead of having all sorts of direct payments made on their behalf. I should be grateful if the Minister could clarify that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to do so now. The clause makes a small technical change. I say that with some trepidation because I know that such phrases immediately make the Opposition think that a matter of high principle or malign intent is being smuggled past them. The clause does no more than remove any scope for misinterpretation of the form that housing benefit may take. It puts the provisions of the 1986 Act on all fours with the Local Government Finance Act 1988 which says that housing and community charge benefits may
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
be passed to the claimants by rebates or reduction in liability or by payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, or inconveniently, parts of the 1986 Act refer just to "payments", "paid" and "payable". It is clear from the whole of the Act that means rebates too. As the two Acts will govern housing benefit in respect of community charge rebates and rent rebates, it is sensible to use the same wording in both so that it is absolutely clear that both forms of receiving the benefit, or putting it to the use of the claimants, are covered in both the governing Acts. That is all it is. I shall consult my brief now to see that I am right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure will be a little, but I hope not too, complicated. After the Minister has moved Government amendment No. 145, referring as he wishes to amendment No. 146,1 will propose the question in the normal way.

I will then immediately call the Opposition to move amendment (a), and a general debate will follow on the first group of amendments as they relate to the Government amendment. At the end decisions will be made on amendment (a) and, if required, later on, in its due place, on amendment (b).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same procedure will follow on the second group of amendments, amendment (g) being moved at the outset but no decision being taken, of course, on amendment No. 163 till it is reached later. Debate should again be limited as closely as possible to the amendments themselves.

The third group will be debated in the same way, amendment (c) being moved first.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will repeat at least some of your instructions at a later stage, Mr. Winterton,as I am not sure that I can carry all of them in mind at present.

</ol>
and any such regulations may, in particular, require the authority to apply within a prescribed period to a rent officer for that determination to be made and may in prescribed cases require him to make that determination on prescribed assumptions."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) For subsection (8) of that section'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this we are also considering Government amendment No. 146.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From April this year, rent officers will take on new functions. They will assess the reasonableness of rents in the deregulated private sector for the purposes of housing benefit subsidy. These new arrangements will ensure that local authorities receive subsidy on housing benefit paid on rents up to, but not above, market levels, and thus ensure that housing benefit follows but does not lead the market. The amendment makes provisions relating to aspects of the new arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, subsidy will in general be paid only on benefit for rent up to the level that the rent officer considers reasonable in market terms. There will be exceptions where some subsidy will be paid on rent above that level, for instance where an elderly or disabled person could not be expected to move. As the legislation stands at present, the Secretary of State may exercise his discretion under section 30(2)(b) of the Social Security Act 1986 to deduct from subsidy any amount he considers it unreasonable to meet from public funds. In doing so, he can have regard to rent officers' determinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we feel that it is right that the same practice should apply here as applies to the payment of subsidy in general and that the annual subsidy order made under section 30(2)(a) of the Act should set out the rate of subsidy payable in particular circumstances. That section, with its power of discretion, should apply, as it does in relation to subsidy in general, only as a fall back in exceptional circumstances where the provisions in the subsidy order do not cover the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not yet have the subsidy order so we are in some difficulty here. We do not know what exceptions will be made. We cannot accept the Minister's word about when we can expect a subsidy order. The drafting of the regulations has not even begun. How can we respond to him when we have only his word and his interpretation, which is far removed from the letter of the law?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are simply saying that it will be put in a subsidy order. I think that the hon. Member accepts that—I wait for the piece of paper that may contradict my interpretation. The amendment requires that such things are put down in a subsidy order which has to come before the House. That is its purpose. It makes it no longer a matter simply for the Secretary of State's discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second provision relates to applications by local authorities to rent officers for determination of reasonable market rents. The Social Security Act 1986 contains powers to require local authorities to provide rent officers with the information they need to carry out their functions. During the drafting of the orders to be made under the Housing Act 1988 and the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988 which set out rent officers' functions, it became clear that it would not be reasonable to place a duty on rent officers to make determinations without making equally explicit the duty of local authorities to apply for a determination in the first place. The amendment will put it beyond doubt that local authorities are required to apply for a determination in appropriate cases. Any authority that does not make such applications in the period before this provision can be brought into effect will be required to do so during a set period after the regulations are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment, the matter which increases the opportunities for parliamentary scrutiny. It removes from the Secretary of State's simple discretion and puts it in an order that has to be laid before the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The regulation does precisely the opposite. It gives the Secretary of State the power to prescribe what the deductions will be without a subsidy order. We are totally in his hands. Through the amendment, he is simply saying, "Leave it to me."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is not saying that at all. He is saying that we shall proceed as we usually do with subsidy orders. Subsidy orders are laid before the House and the local authority associations are consulted throughout their preparation. It is not a matter of leaving it to me or the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am almost struck dumb by the Minister's gall in referring to consultation with local authorities. It is not even, "Leave it to me." It is, "Leave it to me until I have thought of something and when I know what it is I shall let you know retrospectively and if you don't get it right we'll clobber you."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's intervention was brief and entertaining but does not give an accurate description of the process of negotiation and consultation. We have discussed that before and shall no doubt do so again where it arises under other amendments. I do not believe that the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Under-Secretary can be left to suggest that this is simply a technical amendment while his superior slips off for coffee. The Minister of State may not have explained to the Under-Secretary that he has been left carrying the can for the Housing Act 1988. When it was a Bill, that measure was debated in this very Committee Room, and the ends and additions of that Bill and the references to housing benefit were never reconciled. The Department of Social Security is now trying to tidy up the ends in retrospect after the denials that we were given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I am concerned about the performance of the Government Front Bench, and I think that there is a conspiracy going on. The Minister of State was outside in the coffee queue. He got nearly to the front, was waylaid by two Back Benchers who are far to the Right of him, then had to go to the back of the queue again. The same thing happened when he again reached the front of the queue. The poor man had to queue three times, and he has not yet drunk his coffee. He has left the Under-Secretary of State, who does not understand the Bill anyway, to carry the can for him. That is a disgrace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not a point of order for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know why Government Back Benchers are so indignant. The Under-Secretary of State can hardly be expected to understand the Bill when the Government plainly have not finished writing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am tempted to say to the Committee that I shall suspend the sitting to enable me to have a cup of coffee, but I shall not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must be careful with our language, Mr. Winterton. I shall be most cautious about how I frame my reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The comment of my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South is most charitable because she suggests that it is not entirely the responsibility of the Under-Secretary of State that he is in difficulties. The Minister may be out in the Corridor discussing with the former Minister with responsibility for housing why he has been landed in this situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
I remind the Committee of the context. As the Bill which became the Housing Act 1988—which deregulated the private rented sector—went through Committee, the Opposition repeatedly asked the then housing Minister what he meant by market rents. He said that rents would go up. Of course, the Secretary of State for the Environment did not concede that because of his great theory about the market: rents will go up; so more houses will be built because everyone will get in on the act; people will flood into the houses, and, as a result, there will be oversupply and the rents will all come down. That theory has never been proved in history, but the Secretary of State for the Environment still somehow believes in it as a fragment from the past. At least the Minister with responsibility for housing did not believe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He accepted that rents would rise in the private sector. We asked the housing Minister what would happen if some unscrupulous landlord—such as the one who was involved in a court case being brought at the time by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea—put the rents up so much that the Department of Social Security ended up paying the bill of someone on housing benefit. Deregulating market rents would mean that the Department of Social Security would pick up the tab.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some ways, the Government could have said to us, as an Opposition, that it did not really matter because if the rents were £150 a week, people could go along and get housing benefit to pay them. I asked the Minister with responsibility for housing about it at every opportunity and at one point—although I do not have the reference from the 	<i>Hansard</i> of the Standing Committee before me — he chided me and asked me to sit down. He said that he had repeated six times that housing benefit would be available for the full amount of rent for anyone whose rent went up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We went downstairs and looked at the public expenditure White Papers and then looked at the graphs for housing benefit. Has housing benefit gone up over the past seven years? No, it is a falling graph. If we look at the projection for the next five years, we might expect what the Chancellor calls a blip to allow for the market increase in rents. Is that blip on the graph? No, it is not. Housing benefit continues to go down. The Government have a problem. How on earth do they square paying market rents when they are going to blow the budget of the Department of Social Security? That is the reality. Everyone will get in on the act as a landlord.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that, due to the substantial reduction in unemployment and the general improvement in the economy, one would expect the number of people receiving housing benefit to decrease?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that you will rule me out of order if I proceed along that line, Mr. Winterton. But the hon. Gentleman really does touch a nerve. Contrary to the national figures, unemployment went up in my constituency on the last count, so I am not of the general belief that unemployment is falling everywhere. That is not true for some areas. It is precisely our point that there is an uneven distribution of wealth
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
and income in our society and an uneven development in the economy. Some people are paying a high price for that. But you will rule me out of order, Mr. Winterton, if I expound further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The mythology about changes in unemployment is magnified enormously in Conservative Members' view of life. Counter to that is the great increase in the value of property. That increase has spread from London throughout the country. Because of the Housing Act 1988, which is based on a theoretical return on a capital sum, or the capital value of a house, an enormous increase in the level of housing benefit will be required. Any improvement referred to by the hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) will be washed out entirely by the increasing capital value of homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a pertinent point. The Government's policy of letting the market rent sector flourish and their belief that the key to solving the housing problem is capital investment in property have led to speculative development in property rather than real homes being provided for people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point about housing benefit, if the Government are not prepared to control private sector rents and to keep them at an affordable level—we had the great debate on what the word "affordable" meant—they have a problem of their own making. That problem has been pushed out of the Department of the Environment and into the Department of Social Security. I should like to know what consultation there was before that stage was reached. It seems that the Housing Act is totally at odds with what the Department of Social Security tells us about other areas of policy. The Government are now landed with introducing an amendment late in the day to try by technical means to put matters right and to reverse what was said in discussions on the Housing Bill. The then Minister with responsibility for housing gave assurances to the Standing Committee that rents would be paid. We find that there is a truth in that, but landlords can charge whatever they like. We can go to the rent officers, but what will happen? The contribution that the local authority makes to housing benefit could be capped. In other words, pensioners could find their rent increasing and expect the housing benefit to go up to match it, but it would not go up by as much and there would be a gap. From where is that gap funded? The money has to come out of the pensioners' income. The money that they have to spend on other items such as food and clothing will be reduced because they have to match the gap in housing benefit. This is a problem of the Government's own making.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes even further. If local authorities were then to make a subsidy—they have the power to do so—they would incur penalties. Local authorities will be penalised for paying housing benefits to people whose landlords have raised their rent and for trying to protect them from rises for which they are not responsible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New penalties were introduced in the wake of the 1986 Act, when reduced subsidy paid on benefit in respect of rents over a certain limit was introduced. After April 1989, subsidy will be completely cut off
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
above the level determined by the rent officer. That is the crucial point behind the amendment. The problem reflects the Government's policy dilemma. They should not let private rents go to market levels and then refuse to pay the rents of people who are on benefit because they want to cut the benefit system; yet that is what the Government amendment would do. Our amendment is in the form of a deletion, so that we can tell the Secretary of State that that is no way to carry on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 121 (l)of the Housing Act 1988 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may by order require rent officers to carry out such functions as may be specified in the order in connection with housing benefit and rent allowance subsidy."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 145 mentions "Housing Act functions", but we do not know what those are, nor what additions and deductions there may be, because the subsidy order for 1988-89 has not yet been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should add that many promises that were made in the context of the Housing Act 1988 have never materialised. The Government promised a social landlords' charter to provide a framework for ensuring that landlords did not exploit people by keeping them in unacceptable conditions and charging unacceptable rents. That did not emerge in the debate on the Housing Bill and has still not emerged because the former Minister with responsibility for housing took his commitments with him when he moved sideways to the Foreign Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Miraculously, the Ministers who now serve in the Department of the Environment do not seem to recall any of the promises that were made. The Housing Bill was drafted on certain assumptions, one of which was that people would receive their full entitlement to housing benefit, whatever their rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister now asks for a personal power to be given to the Secretary of State to prescribe deductions by reference to rent officers' determinations. Our amendment would not give him that power. If the subsidy order under the Housing Act 1988 has not been written, it is not Parliament's but the Government's fault. They put the Housing Act on the tracks and have moved so fast to rush legislation through that they have now crashed into the Social Security Bill and are trying to square the circle by a sleight of hand. Local authorities and people who find their incomes and housing benefit reduced will pay the price.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be a policy drive. The Minister says that local authorities will be penalised if they pay above the rent officer's limit. Although local authorities will be able to pay above that limit, they will receive no subsidy for doing so. Rent officers currently have no powers to control rents, which are free in the market. They only have powers to restrict the benefit subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Minister's proposal be reconciled with the next Housing Bill? As he is picking up the pieces of the Housing Act, discussions are starting this morning on the Local Government and Housing Bill, which contains different proposals for housing benefit. Does the Minister believe that local authorities should raise housing benefit solely from poll tax contributions, as the Local Government and Housing Bill implies? If it is to be left up to local authorities, why does the Secretary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>727</span>
of State need to intervene? Why cannot the regulations be left at local level? That is the logic of that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If local authorities are to manage housing benefit entirely, why should the Secretary of State have the power to control it? The Government's logic is inconsistent. Either housing benefit is a national issue and should be paid from the national budget, or the Minister agrees with his colleagues on the Local Government and Housing Bill that it is a local authority responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will have to square the circle again in 12 months' time by introducing another Social Security Bill, on to which another Government amendment will be tacked loosely. The Minister was hoping to slip this through as a technical amendment by suggesting that it contains no great detail or weight. In effect, many people will have to pay the price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) worked himself up to great indignation and was distressed at what he thought were inconsistencies in the Government's position. I am disappointed that he does not understand the position after sitting through the Housing Bill debates. I was not a member of that Committee and cannot reproduce the arguments that may have been used there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members suggested that although the Goverment talk about consultation, it does not occur. Consultation takes place frequently and is a continuing aspect of housing legislation and the rent officer's role. The amendment about which the hon. Gentleman seemed to be unhappy would require the rent officer's role to be included in the subsidy order that is laid before the House, rather than left to the Secretary of State's discretion. I should have thought that the hon. Gentleman would welcome that, as it would allow it to be debated by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned pensioners who cannot meet their new rents. He seems to forget that those who currently live in regulated tenancies will remain in them. Local authorities will have no choice about meeting the housing benefit of elderly people whose tenancies are unregulated. They must pay housing benefit to them and to other vulnerable groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also fails to understand the basic idea of market rents. The rent officer's task will be to assess market rents locally and to advise the local authority that it cannot pay housing benefit above market rents. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that some landlords would charge above the going rate if they knew that the tenant did not have to pay. The local authority would be uninterested in that fact, if the subsidy were automatically recovered from the Government. Control is needed to ensure that rents for which housing benefit is paid follow rather than lead the market. However accommodation for which people who do not receive housing benefit are paying rents must be available to demonstrate that such a market exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that it will be expensive in the short term, but it remains to be seen whether more housing
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
benefit will be paid out. The objective is to bring more reasonably priced, quality accommodation for rent on to the market. Given the fury and indignation that the hon. Gentleman vented against the proposals, it is clear that he does not believe that that will happen, but he will find the truth to be otherwise. That marks the difference between us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman thinks that the proposals can produce more accommodation where it is badly needed and where there is a demand for it, he would at least wish for the change to be given a reasonable trial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two points to put to the Minister. The first is about market rent levels. If a rent officer fixes a market rent level, the person charging rent can continue to charge it, and it will be a matter of telling a local authority, that it will not get the subsidy. We could have a long debate about the number of people who will have unregulated tenancies compared with those with regulated tenancies. We have debated that matter before on previous Housing Bills. I am prepared to use those debates as a background, but I do not believe that I should do so at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister confirm that local authorities will not have a choice? I accept that they will have to pay housing benefit to the vulnerable groups to which he referred, but the regulation means that they will receive only a 50 per cent, subsidy for doing so. From where will the other money come? Is it not true that this is merely a 50 per cent, cut in national funding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That possibility is taken into account in the rate support grant. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that money will be found by local authorities from cash that could be used in some other way. As local authorities have some discretion over those who are in that category, it is right that they should have an incentive to ensure that if those people move to other accommodation, it is to places where the rents are not artificially higher than the market would set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that the hon. Gentleman has grasped the fact that a rent officer can determine whether a rent is above the market rate only if other accommodation is available in the area at a reasonable rent. If there is not, there is no market rent at a lower level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I urge the Minister not to pursue that line of argument, for the reason that there is a provision in the Local Government and Housing Bill that if rent is not paid which includes housing benefit, people can be evicted. That is a mandatory provision under schedule 2 of the new Local Government and Housing Bill. If a rent is disputed and housing benefit is not paid, it means that people will have to go. Certainly there will be an incentive for people to move to another category—they will be thrown out. That line of argument is no defence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to argue about what may or may not be in a Bill that is being discussed down the Corridor, but I repeat a point with which the hon. Gentleman has not dealt. Because of the definition of "market", there must be other accommodation available in the area at rents that the rent officer has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
established otherwise he would not be following the market as he is required to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not my experience of how the system invariably works. I have known rent officers to determine whether rents were suitable for an area and to raise them substantially above the rents that were being charged. As far as anyone could judge, they were using their own criteria. In my constituency, we noted that when a rent officer moved into the area from somewhere else, where housing costs were a great deal higher, he promptly started to demand far higher rents, not because of the market in the locality but because he was used to higher rents and thought that people should pay them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady talks as though the system will not be changed. A rent officer will be required to follow real rents for real property that is available on the market in the area that he covers. He will not be permitted to use his private, personal criteria.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one flaw in what the Minister says. When he speaks of property that is available, it does not mean that it is empty. It could be occupied. The rent officer takes the level of rents that are already charged. All the houses could be occupied and he could determine that there is a market rent level and that someone is charging higher rents. Therefore that person does not get the benefit subsidy and will be evicted. That does not necessarily mean that he or she will find another home, because there is a housing shortage in Britain. That is part of the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions are the enabling arrangements for the Housing Act 1988, which directly tackles the housing shortage. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman wants extra housing to come on to the market, so he will have the satisfaction of seeing that he is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that a lot of rented accommodation which does not have the protection of the Rent Act is coming on to the market? Shorthold tenancies do not have the benefit of Rent Act protection. When dealing with housing benefit, local authorities now ensure that the rents charged for shorthold tenancies are at market rates. We have such regulations already. No landlord in his right mind would let a tenancy that gave security of tenure to tenants. Nothing will change under the new regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are encouraging signs that more property is coming on to the market, even at this early stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will thank the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) for his intervention, because it sabotages the Minister's case and takes the lid off the market economy argument. In all Opposition constituencies—I do not know about Conservative constituencies—a great deal of rented property is coming on to the market. The average rents being asked for privately rented one-bedroom flats in my constituency are between £100 and £150 a week.
	<span class='label label-info column'>730</span>
That is way beyond the means of anybody. In the long-run, people will not get full benefit for such rents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they are on income support they will normally be entitled to 100 per cent. That is the arrangement. Housing benefit entitlement is related to the market rent in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Opposition Members have misunderstood my comments. Of course more rented accommodation will come on to the market because no landlord will allow premises to be rented to tenant who enjoy security of tenure. That immediately devalues the property by around two thirds. Premises can be rented on short-hoid tenancies, so the present regulations apply. Local authorities are dutybound now to ensure that those paying rents in excess of market rents do not qualify for housing benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true. In Stockport, the local authority ensures that people do not get housing benefit if the rent is above the market level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies, I remind the Committee that we are debating a fairly narrow Opposition Amendment. It will be open to the Committee to debate the Government Amendment later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Winterton, so I shall turn to the Amendment so ably and passionately moved by the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (a) would remove entirely from the primarly legislation a general power which was taken with the specific intention of providing necessary discretion for the Secretary of State to reduce subsidy payments to local authorities in particular cases. In general, rates of subsidy payable to authorities are set out in the annual housing benefit subsidy order and those provisions cover the vast majority of all cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, they cannot be exhaustive and - in what I must stress are exceptional circumstances - there will be occasions when the Secretary of State believes that an authority has acted unreasonably and that it is right to reduce the subsidy to be paid to them. But the relatively broad provision of the subsidy order do not cover every case and may not cover that specific case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said authorities may be deemed to be acting "unreasonably". That is a broad expression of the power that the Government have taken to themselves. What is mean by that phrase?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a variety of cases and circumstances for which subsidies are paid and there may be disagreements about whether a subsidy should be paid. Those disagreements are usually settled by discussion and argument, but occasionally the subsidy can be claimed or not paid back. As the hon. Gentlemen knows, a reconciliation occurs at the end of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>731</span>
the year. In one example, Sheffield did not make allowance for tenants who wished to do their own repair, maintenance and decorating work. Therefore the subsidy being paid was as if the council did the work. That is a relatively small and specific case, but if agreement had not been reached the power may have been required. Although the Secretary of State requires the power, it would seldom be used. His use of it can be challenged in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not suggest that most authorities would contemplate action which would require that discretion to be used, but, if a particular authority does act unreasonably in a way which would lead to unjustifiable expenditure, we need to retain powers to deal with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for cases subject to a rent officer's determination, the amendment would mean that subsidy provisions would be made in the annual subsidy order only, with no scope for the Secretary of State to exercise discretion, if necessary, in the exceptional case to which I have referred. It is our intention that provision should be made in the subsidy order but the discretionary fall-back power is needed in those cases, as it is in all other cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a fundamental contradiction and it was exposed by the hon. Member for Stockton (Mr. Favell). If the Government propose simply to deregulate the market, rents will find their own level in the market by supply and demand. In that case, rent officers will not be necessary. I am amazed by the hon. Gentlemen's description of procedure in Stockport, and I shall look closely into that. The Minister could say "We have abolished rent officers altogether because we know the average rent, the market level of rents and the highest and lowest rents. Therefore we can estimate."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rent officers are not being used to regulate the market. They are not allowed to tell landlords that they are charging too much rent and so will not get that rent. Rent officers say to local authorities, "Pay all that rent", even though they know that it is above the market level. Then they tell local authorities, "When you have paid all that rent, you will not get the subsidy." There is no discretion about that and that will be the effect of the clause. Does the Minister accept that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a role for rent officers. Landlords could charge those on housing benefit rents far above the market level unless there was a check on market levels. The hon. Gentlemen does not appreciate that rent officers note rents charged in a neighbourhood. Why is the hon. Gentlemen so baffled? The procedure will differ from the present system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister seems to think that, at the end of the day, the landlords will not get the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But they get all the money. They carry on. They put their rents up and the money is paid to them. However, the local authority will not get the money back from paying out housing benefit subsidy. Therefore money
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
is still being sent through to landlords who are charging exorbitant rents; it is the local authorities that are being penalised. They have to recover the cost from the other ratepayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not such a lengthy process as the hon. Gentleman thinks. The rent officer always keeps his eye on rents, and always has rents on which subsidy or housing benefit has been claimed reported to him. He is in constant contact with the local authority, which will have a good idea of what the market rents are, and of the rent levels for which full subsidy will be available when the would-be tenant applies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister give us a categoric assurance that no local authority will have to pay a subsidy to a private landlord that he cannot subsequently reclaim from central Government funds? Or will local authorities in effect be subsidising high, private sector rents?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not so. The local authority can pay the housing benefit that it wishes to pay. What it cannot do is to reclaim over and above what the rent officer has ruled is a market rent for that kind of property in the area. It cannot claim that as a housing benefit subsidy from the Exchequer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important point, especially in London and the south-east where rents are going up rapidly. A local authority may have to meet the full cost of the rent required, because of the housing benefit judgment. The rent might be above the rent officer's assessed level. In that case, a local authority in a hard-pressed area will be subsidising high rents. It will have no control over them, since it cannot control the market, due to the deregulation of rented tenancies following the Housing Act 1988, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More thought needs to be given to the matter to ensure that local authorities do not end up subsidising high rents; if more thought is not given to it, people might be made homeless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities will have to pay benefit to those in vulnerable groups who live in property for which the rent may be higher than had been expected. They will get a 50 per cent, subsidy, but not the full 97 per cent, subsidy that is automatically given now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do people not get 90 per cent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because some discretion over the payment is given. Secondly, we want a dynamic, not a static situation. The rented market is rather static. The purpose of the changes is to bring extra property on to the market. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) laughs, as does the hon. Member for Leeds, West. I hope that they will still be laughing, though in a different tone, when the additional property comes on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a market rent requires properties to be available in the area. They need to be either changing hands or being advertised to people who are not on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
housing benefit at those rent levels. It is not a construct of the rent officer, which the hon. Member for Derby, South was talking about; the information is drawn from the market at that particular time. Changes in the market are reflected in the rent officer's advice to local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To whom is the Minister giving way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to be picked out. There is an increase in private rented property on the market in my constituency. Some of it is on the market because elderly tenants in protected tenancies in the past have died, so they have now become deregulated tenancies with high rents. Others are coming on to the market because of deregulation. The problem is that the rent officer's assessment is often well behind the rate at which the market forces are forcing up that rent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like all London local authorities, my local authority is hard pressed and hard up at present. Therefore it wishes to keep such people in any form of tenancy that it can, otherwise they become a burden on the local authority housing sector. The difficulty is that unless the Minister is prepared to introduce some regulation into rents, or a guarantee of payment of the entire rent — whatever the rent level adjudged by the local authority — landlords will be able to charge whatever they like. People will be forced to pay it because of the appalling public housing, and local authorities will end up subsidising extravagant and extortionate rents by private sector landlords because of the social consequences of doing otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rent officer is required neither to trail behind the market nor to lead the market but to be up with it. Therefore it would not be possible for a rent officer's ruling to be well below what the market is demanding for the property in question, if the rent officer is doing the job that he is required to do. There will be a review process if the local authority feels that that is happening. However, the real solution and answer to the hon. Gentlemens fear is that the rent officer should do the job as the Government are legislating that he should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Over the past year the Government have made clear that they do not believe in housing subsidy. They believe that all the expenditure should come from the housing revenue account. The housing support grant has been cut substantially. Two thirds of the 56 Scottish local authorities received no subsidy. Some are using the capital receipts that they get from house sales. In place of rate-borne and housing subsidies, the Government would rather see house rents set at affordable levels. If the Government believe in that policy and have deregulated the scheme, they must understand that rents will go through the roof. One would have expected the housing revenue accounts to be used for repairs and maintenance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has ranged much more widely than the amendments. Housing benefit subsidy will be paid up to the 97 per cent, that is paid now on housing benefit. It will be paid to those entitled to it in property where the rents are at or below market rents, but not above, so there will be not an extra but a lesser burden on the local authority. If it draws extra housing on to the market, there will also be less of a housing problem for the local authority to deal with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a constituency case that relates to this matter. Mr. Khan and his wife have both been very ill; they do not have any children and they are renting a house for £45 a week. The local authority is providing them with £25 a week housing benefit. The case is before the rent officer to determine whether that is the right level. Out of their limited benefit, this couple are paying the remainder of the rent. Is that right? There is some regulation of what is a fair level of housing benefit. Similar regulation should apply to the landlord and the level of rent that he can extract. In the case of this couple the money they need for heating and food will be spent on rent. Surely that is wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I followed all the implications of the case that the hon. Lady put to me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So long as the regulated rent is not higher than the market rent in the area, the housing benefit will be increased to meet that rent. I cannot say at present how that would work in an individual case where there is additional income. It is easier to talk about it for someone on income support, where the assistance with rent is 100 per cent. Where the tapers take effect it is more complicated, and I would not like to try to analyse a case above income support levels on the spur of the moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must try to make myself clear. If it is right to regulate the level of housing benefit that should be paid according to some notion of a fair or reasonable rent, why is it not right to regulate the rent that the landlord can charge? The present position is that people might pay more in rent than they receive in housing benefit. They will have to pay it out of their income support—the money that they need for food and heating. That is wrong. If it is right to regulate housing benefit it is right to regulate rents. Why will not the Government do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want rents to find their own level to draw more accommodation on to the market. The hon. Lady talked about going to the rent officer as if the new scheme were in effect. The new arrangements do not start until April. She cannot be describing the rent officer's tasks that he will in future have in determining the current market rent in the area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am giving an example of what is happening now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People on income support will receive 100 per cent, of their rents unless the local authority has determined that the rent is unreasonably high in which case the local authority may say that it will not

	<span class='label label-info column'>735</span>
meet it. If the hon. Lady writes to me about the particular case that she has in mind, I will reply but 1 do not feel that I can do it adequate justice in Committee as I would have to ask her more questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I suggest that interventions come a little less frequently. The Minister is being deluged with notes that he has no opportunity to look at and assimilate. If we are to have a meaningful debate, it is important, that he responds in full to each sensible intervention. We must restrict our remarks to the fairly narrow amendment before us. We shall deal with the more general principle in full when we debate the Government amendment—but we are discussing not that, but amendments to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the amendment was moved by the hon. Member for Leeds, West and he has not said anything for a little time, at least not standing up, I give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never seen so many notes sent to a Minister in a Committee. There is a great deal of confusion, perhaps because we are not keeping up with the pace of legislation. I know what the position is with regard to rent legislation now and I know what it was when the Housing Act 1988 came into force on 19 January 1989. From 1 April, the new rent officer's description will be there. We are in some difficulty because the order that we are now discussing has not yet been written. I listened carefully to the Minister. He has repeatedly said that the local authority has discretion. I am arguing so passionately against that point of view because I do not believe that it does. If the Minister gives me an assurance that local authorities will have discretion, I will withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Within limits, they have some discretion. The point of the clause is to set down what the arrangements are in the subsidy order, so that they will go before the House and so that it is quite clear within what limits that discretion operates. I accept that the hon. Gentleman is familiar with the rules and regulations that govern housing now, but we are talking about amendments that relate to the arrangements that will come into effect. They are very different. As I have said before, the objective of the changes is to bring additional property on to the market — to revive the market. The hon. Member for Ladywood laughs, but I hope that in two or three years' time it will be laughter of satisfaction that it has turned out differently from what she expects.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect to the Minister, I should like to give him some advice. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) is indeed familiar with the provisions of housing legislation. He also served on the Committee that examined the Housing Act 1988. The Minister has an
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
arduous job to do at the Department. The chances are extremely high that my hon. Friend is rather more familiar with the provisions of housing legislation than he is. The Minister is developing an uncomfortable habit of lecturing the Opposition in a kindly way as if we do not quite understand what we are talking about, when sometimes we are slightly more seized of some of the wider implications than the Minister can perhaps be, because of the scope of his duties. He is causing Opposition hackles to rise, I suspect unintentionally, because, as many of us do on these occasions, my hon. Friend knows exactly what he is talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I conceded that the hon. Gentleman knew a great deal about the present housing law, regulations and policy. I also said that he must know a great deal more about the proceedings of the Committee that considered the Housing Act than I because he was a member of it. However, I suggested that he appeared to have forgotten that the thrust of the policy, of which this is a part, is to bring more housing on to the market. We have different views about this. The Opposition do not believe that that will happen. If they thought that it would, they would at least look with a more kindly, if not totally enthusiastic, eye at the thrust of the legislation. The Government's motive is to get more property on to the market, and to ensure that where market, or lower than market, rents are charged, the full entitlement to housing benefit is met. The rent officer has a crucial role in that. He informs the local authority of the market rent in an area at any particular time and updates that information so that it never drops behind, as the hon. Member for Islington, North understandably fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier on, I was discourteous enough to say that the Minister did not understand the Bill. He does understand it and I retract that comment. What he does not understand are its implications, which are extremely serious. I have before me the list of the potential rent assessments in each London borough. The lowest high rent threshold is Greenwich with £55.13 per week, the highest is Camden with £88.09 per week, and in my borough it is £64 a week. I am not familiar with the private rented sector in either Greenwich or Camden but I am with my own. For £64 a week, one could hardly rent a bed-sit and certainly one would not get a flat. In the ultimate free market there will, presumably, be a great deal of fluctuation. What provision will there be for reassessment by the rent officer before the normal 12-month reassessment has elapsed? I am concerned that housing benefit will be regulated very closely as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) said, but, in the words of the Minister, rent levels in the private sector will not be regulated. Unless I have misread the situation, the local authority will, in effect, be subsidising high rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, and in view of the control that central Government now exert over local government expenditure, will there be come-back from the Department of The Environment? Will it say that a local authority is overspending because it is subsidising high rents to keep people out of homelessness or off its own housing waiting lists?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>737</span>
I apologise to the Minister for making rather a long intervention, but in view of the storm of paper that—it is a snow drift by now—I am sure that he will be eternally grateful to me for giving him time to read the four notes that have come from the Civil Service Bench during my intervention. If he wishes me to raise some other points, I am quite happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I permitted the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) to continue so that the Minister could do precisely that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a general rule, when a rent officer has assessed a rent for a particular property, that is unlikely to be reviewed in the immediate future. Of course, the rent officer will be continually monitoring—to use that word again, in a way similiar to that used by my hon. Friend the Minister—the movement of market rents in the area. That is, the rent officer will monitor the movement of rents, because the market will be deregulated. There will be constant update of the information about new lettings and new applications for housing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the hon. Gentleman is worried that a figure will be set, and either the market will move away from it and it will not be reviewed, or the rent officer might suggest a figure that he thinks should be the market figure but is not. The rent officer is required to monitor, from actual rents being charged, the rents that are being advertised for property that is being let, so not merely the rent officer but his local authority will be up to date and knowledgeable about what the market requires in the way of rents. If they are in tandem, there will be little danger that the authority will allow a claimant to saddle himself with a property only to find, when the assessment is made some weeks later that he has to pay an excess over the amount on which housing benefit can be paid because he is paying well above the market rate. The local authority is likely to know that straightaway. As the hon. Gentleman has said, his local authority is well seized of the rents in its area and it will find itself in agreement with the rent officer on them if both are doing their jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister is saying. The problem is that rates are rising very quickly, and I need to be clear about how often the rent officer can reassess the situation. The council is aware of what private sector rents are and it is looking at them all the time. The Committee needs to know what provision there is for reassessment. We need also an answer to the last—and crucial—question that I asked, which the Minister may not have heard. Will there be a power of central Government to withold grants from local authorities if they believe them to have overspent above the rent officer's assessed level in supporting peope in tenancies through housing benefit? In other words, will the Minister's friends in the Department of the Environment say that that is an unreasonable expenditure; therefore, it should cease? That is important and is of genuine concern, particularly to the London local authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the local authority pays benefit over and above the market rent as established by the rent
	<span class='label label-info column'>738</span>
officer, central-Government will not pay that subsidy. It will be met from the local authority's resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will local authorities be penalised? There will be many disputes about benefits so it will happen often. In Camden, the rent level is set at £88 and the real rent of a flat is around £100—£12 a week more. Will the Department of the Environment say to the district auditor, "We believe Camden has been overspending on that". Camden's defence would be that the rent officer is way off beat. Who would resolve such an argument? Either the local authority will have to pay and be surcharged, or the tenant will lose the tenancy to someone who can pay without having recourse to housing benefit. Claimants will be deterred from going into private sector flats.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rent limits that the hon. Gentleman refers to are not assessments of market rents by a rent officer. Those have yet to be done because the market has only just been deregulated and it will take time to become established. Rent officers are not yet formally in place for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a local authority believes that rent officers have erroneously judged the levels of market rent, there is a process of review and appeal. I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman the details of that process now, because it is not the responsibility of my Department. When there is disagreement, there will be an opportunity for arbitration elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to clarify the divide. The Government view deregulation of the housing market as a way to provide housing. We pour scorn on that because we do not agree, but let that be the point of divide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If deregulation provides housing and market rents go up—and we agree on that because the Minister with responsibility for housing and this Minister accept that—we are faced with the question of whether the Government will pay housing benefit for those who need it.

The Minister referred to what would happen if rents are at market level and below. What happens if they are higher? The local authority has no discretion—it must pay out. The market is not regulated. People such as Nicholas Hoogstratten—who was taken to court for his high rents—may charge whatever they wish, and they will not be taken to court in future. The local authority must pay the rents. Rent officers will merely penalise local authorities by saying, "We are not refunding the subsidy once it has been paid out". If the local authority contests the decision, the tenant could have a long wait during the dispute. People cannot even go to appeal during that period. They will be mandatorily evicted and will those their homes. Why is the Department using the rent officer simply to penalise local authorities? Why is subsidy being removed when the Government agree that market rents should be paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing people moving to a new property, and claiming benefit for the first time on that property. The local authority, knowing what market rents are in an area, will be able to advise

	<span class='label label-info column'>739</span>
quickly that full benefits will not be payable if people move into properties with high rents. Regulations similar to those which apply now will continue to apply to people already in properties. We are discussing people moving into new property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People do not go to the council to ask permission to move into a flat. They do a deal with a landlord, arrange to move in, and once they have done so they fill in their housing benefit forms. That goes to the local authority which checks with the rent officer. By that time, a person may have been in the property for up to four weeks, and there is, now a dispute about that person's rent, the person will be a victim of the time lapse. The rent will not have been paid to the landlord because the person will think that he is entitled to housing benefit, and therefore he will lose his home. That is the reality. People do not queue at the town hall to ask for lists of privately rented properties, to be given a note advising them of the acceptable rent level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: People receiving housing benefit should at least take the sensible precaution of inquiring whether they will receive the full benefit. It is a small price to pay if, despite the hon. Gentleman's doubts, there are more properties for those individuals to choose from.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already explained four times that the rent officer can determine a market only if property is available at that price. The level set by the rent officer will not be a notional idea of his own, but will be based on information that properties are changing hands at those rents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (b) would return to the position that would obtain without the Government amendment. It would remove the power for the Secretary of State to make provision in the subsidy order and would instead allow him discretion to decide what deductions from subsidy should be made where cases had been subject to a rent officer's determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already explained, the Government believe that the rent officer arrangements should operate within the framework of the provisions that apply to all other cases. The appropriate rates of subsidy should be laid down in the order, which is subject to parliamentary approval, and the Secretary of State's discretion should be invoked only in exceptional cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the hon. Member for Leeds, West wishes to see system in which a whole-area of subsidy payment is at the Secretary of State's discretion, instead of being laid down in legislation. I ask the Committee to reject the amendments if the hon. Gentleman presses them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We press amendments to demonstrate that we feel strongly about them. Sometimes we withdraw amendments because we accept the reasonableness of the Minister's response and feel that there is no great contention. At other times, we withdraw amendments because we feel that the matter is so important that we should return to it on Report and press it much further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

I believe that the Government are extremely confused about the role of rent officers. That was demonstrated by the contribution of the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell). I do not blame the Minister, as he has been given this job recently, but the hon. Minister for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe) is well aware of what happened during the Housing Act 1988 and I was waiting for her to intervene to help the Minister. I would then have echoed her words to show that the Minister was contradicting what was said in the Committee examining that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I add to the contribution of my hon. Friend the Minister for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) by saying that the Local Government and Housing Bill is being discussed down the corridor. It proposes, yet again, to change housing benefit rules, along the lines that my hon. Friend outlined with regard to ring-fencing the housing revenue account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus the game will be changed again. I wonder whether the officials from the Minister's Department, who have been passing the Minister so many notes, are aware of the proposals that went through in the Housing Act 1988 and those yet to come as a result of the Local Government and Housing Bill. 1 enjoyed listening to phrases such as, "easing the rigidities in the housing market", and assertions that have been passionately repeated by Conservative Back Bench Members that housing for everybody to rent will become available. However, the essential dilemma of how people on housing benefit will pay higher rents has not been resolved. The Government do not want to pay them but will not say so, as that would mean that they were regulating the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Minister is about to be passed another note.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my hon. Friend aware that, when a deregulated private sector flat goes on the market, landlords are increasingly saying that they do not want tenants who are in receipt of housing benefit or any other benefit? They foresee a problem over those tenants obtaining benefit and are afraid that they may have to evict them after a few weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is appalling that people on benefit—often long-term benefit—cannot get council accommodation because it no longer exists and cannot take a private sector flat because landlords discriminate against them. That rigidity in the market keeps the poor out of the private sector.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To give my hon. Friend a full response I should have to say more about housing supply. It is high time for a campaign for the right to rent a home. As my hon. Friend said, it works in two ways. In the past, there were examples of landlords who exploited social security by putting up their rents because they knew that they could cream off 100 per cent, and it would effect the pocket of neither the tenant nor the local authority. I, too, believe that that was unjust and am glad that the hon. Member for Stockport nods in assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That can be tackled by doing something about the market rents and by having affordable rents. Rent officers should have—as they had in the past—powers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>741</span>
to say whether landlords are charging too much. The Government are saying that, however much a landlord cares to charge, he should be paid from the public kitty, and the housing benefit should be allowed to go through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) wish to intervene? She is reduced to whispering at me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: She has not caught my eye.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that she will be given permission to intervene because her intervention could be damaging to the Government's case at this stage that it would be left even more shredded than we have made it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If market rents are to be allowed to rise to any level, the Department of Social Security, must be committed to pay them through housing benefits for people in need. The rent officer will have the power to tell local authorities that the Government, having pushed housing benefit back to local authorities, are not prepared to foot the bill. Although local authorities have no discretion in deciding whether to pay those rents to landlords, the Government are whipping out half the money, as only 50 per cent of the housing benefit subsidy will go to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
Some of us passionately opposed the original shifting of housing benefit administration to local authorities, because we believed it should come from, and be administered by, the national kitty. I knew someone in a local authority at that time who said that the staff were given no training or back-up from the Department of Health and Social Security to administer it. If the Local Government and Housing Bill is enacted, it will put the burden on ratepayers and on people who rent public housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should admit that that is the obverse side of "'easing the rigidities in the housing market". The Government refuse to foot the bill for housing benefit, having insisted that it should be paid to landlords who charge scandalously high rents. Rather than regulate rents, they will penalise the council for paying the bill.
