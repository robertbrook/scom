	<p>4.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was being admonished on all sides this morning for previous lapses in attendance, to the extent that I was unable to attend your excellent reception at 11 o'clock Mr. Winterton, for the British war widows and associates. I should have slipped down and been happier with you there for half an hour, had I not been getting a certain amount of stick from both sides of the Committee. I look to you to protect me in my isolation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the debate ended this morning, I was adding my voice to the criticism made by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) about the discretionary powers that the DSS inspectors will have to gain access to compensation papers in trying to adjudicate and define the circumstances relating to claims under the clause. I hope that the Minister will recognise the concern over that, and be able to reassure us that the outline procedures that have been issued will be carefully controlled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee Members should be aware that the extensive range of benefits encompassed by the clause will mean that people who suffer severe accident injuries will be potentially just as affected as victims subject to more minor and trivial injuries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill could have given the Department discretion to waive or reduce the repayable amounts of benefit out of settlements. I see no provision to introduce an element of discretion, and I cannot imagine why the Government do not introduce it, as it would mitigate some of the worst and most anomalous cases that might arise from the implementation of the clause. It is still not too late for Ministers to consider going down that route to mitigate the effects of the clause, if they are insisting on legislating on the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause does not authorise the Department to reduce the clawback if the settlement or compensation award has been arrived at on a compromised basis. Lawyers who have more experience of the matter than I do feel that because the attempt in the clause to ignore the fact that 95 per cent, of the accident compensation claims are settled on a basis of compromise produces difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>904</span>
There could be legal difficulties, where, for example, someone has slipped or tripped and thus an element of contributory negligence was involved on the part of the victim. Secondly, there could be medical difficulties, where someone has sustained a bad back injury, but where he or she has had pre-existing degenerative changes or symptoms, or has had a history of back trouble.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A compromise is inevitably struck in such cases, and the damages to be paid are arrived at on that basis. The proposals create a great deal of uncertainty and unfairness in compromise settlements.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Timothy Kirkhope 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, North-East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened for some time. I did not feel unhelpful to the hon. Gentleman this morning when he started to speak on these issues. I may not have as much knowledge or experience as the hon. Gentleman, but I have some experience of cases such as those that he mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that many cases are ultimately settled by a compromise, to avoid a tedious High Court battle which is bad for the plaintiff and the lawyers themselves. Nevertheless, in the compromises that are reached all the factors that apply or could apply to the compensation that is receivable by the plaintiff are taken into account by the lawyers. Obviously, that sometimes leads to a plaintiff not getting as much compensation as he would have liked or as his circumstances would objectively dictate. Those compromises often work the other way. The defendants settle at an amount which is not as great as it would have been, had the proceedings gone to trial, but the risk element plays on them as much as it plays on the plaintiff and his advisors. These matters are fully taken into account by lawyers. I do not believe that it is inevitable that that will be prejudiced by the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is certainly not my experience. The number of cases where settlements are made in excess of what could be expected if the matter went to court are few—it is almost a hypothetical position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 18 will not enable the agents who are acting on behalf of an accident victim to get proper account taken of the fact that a settlement has been made by an honourable compromise between the two parties. The Department of Social Security benefit will still have to be repaid in full and the full amount of benefit may sometimes exceed the amount of compensation offered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point was also touched upon by the hon. Member for Derby, South. Many more cases will go to court where the victim is faced with the prospect of obtaining no compensation because DSS repayment under the clause will wipe out his or her damages. People who under the present system would settle may now have no option but to proceed to trial. I would take that position myself as an agent if I were in any doubt about a case. That will inevitably place additional pressure on the already over-burdened courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause will also create uncertainty. It states that the benefits to be deducted are those
	<br><q><p>"paid or likely to be paid".</p></q>
When trying to negotiate a settlement of a case, how
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0523">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>905</span>
will a legal adviser to an injured person be able to say what benefits are "likely to be paid"? The Bill gives no guidance about that. How would a dispute about the amount of benefit which is to be repaid be resolved? Paragraph 15 of schedule 2 sets out procedures whereby the Secretary of State may review the certificate of total benefits if the victim disagrees with that but the victim may also appeal to a medical appeal tribunal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to foresee circumstances in which an accident case which has been settled without going before a judge for determination of the damages and without a court hearing at which expert medical witnesses and others give their evidence on the victim's injuries might have to go before a medical appeal tribunal for a decision on those same matters. As the Minister knows, the medical appeal tribunal would be likely to consider the matter without the benefit of expert medical evidence such as would have been given at a court trial and without an experienced judge to decide between the merits of the medical cases put before him. That is another major example of how the clause is flawed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can the victim be satisfied on all occasions that a certificate of benefit has been calculated correctly? Many of these settlements are not made until the parties arive at the door of the courts. Uncertainty about how the certificate of benefit has been calculated will cause delay and doubt about the precise amount of damages that the injured person will receive after deduction of the benefits. Under the clause, such cases will inevitably proceed to trial whereas under the present system an acceptable settlement might be reached between the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been raised before in the debate but the Confederation of British Industry has pointed out that both employers and employees contribute to the national insurance fund which pays for most of the benefits paid to those who, for example are injured at work. As the Committee knows only too well, the state contributes very little to the fund—it is currently some 5 per cent—and from April 1989 it will contribute nothing. The current arrangement is that the injured person keeps a proportion of the benefits to which he or she is entitled and the damages award paid by the employers' insurer is proprtionately reduced in line with the benefit paid. That system acknowledges and permits a compromise which rightly reflects the fact that both employer and employee have paid contributions to the national insurance fund. It is obviously inequitable to require employers to insure themselves twice—first, throught the employer's liability premiums that they are required to pay and, secondly, through national insurance contributions. Similarly, it is unfair to reduce the damages awards made to employees and accident victims as they have paid for their social security benefits through their national insurance contributions. That is a fundamental flaw in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The CBI has pointed out another major flaw, which is that the clause presumes that a compensation payment fully meets the injured worker's financial needs in respect of past, present and future losses. In my experience, that is far from the case. It also presumes that an employee who receives a payment in damages
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>906</span>
as well as some social security benefits receives "double compensation". All the evidence that was available to me as a solicitor showed that damages awards do not fully meet the needs of accident victims, particularly if the award is reduced to take account of contributory negligence. The clause takes no account of contributory negligence and I make no apologies for returning to that point. The Government have suggested that to take account of contributory negligence would provide scope for manipulation between those representing victims and those insuring the defendants in the accident claim. It is surely unreasonable to exclude that factor when it is taken into account in up to half the settlements and awards to victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will benefit from the clause if it is passed unamended? The injured will certainly not benefit. They will probably receive less compensation or possibly no compensation at all and their claim may well take longer and become more difficult to settle. The insurers will not benefit. They will have to pay more compensation, but not necessarily to the injured person. In addition, they will be faced with considerably more administration and bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The employers will not benefit. They will have to pay higher insurance premiums, which will undoubtedly be passed on to their customers. The CBI is oposed to the proposals and has estimated that insurance premiums will increase by 16 per cent, costing employers alone at least another £38 million a year. Total insurance premiums may increase by as much as £60 million a year as car owners will also have to pay higher premiums.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should an accident victim be penalised in this way? I do not understand the Government's logic. The clause will not improve the present system which is effective, simple, well understood and has been used for the past 40 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are not prepared to concede the principle of the clause, there are two or three ways in which they could mitigate its worst effects. First, they could take discretionary powers to waive or alter some repayments. That is a simple, obvious way to proceed. Secondly, the method that the hon. Member for Derby, South offered the Government in amendment No. 268 was also a reasonable way to proceed. It would restrict the obligation to repay social security benefits only to compensation cases that proceeded to a trial before a judge, and where a decision had been made on the award of damages and an apportionment made between damages for pain and suffering and damages for financial loss. Social security benefits could then be repaid, calculated and scaled down in relation to how much the judge had awarded for financial loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister casually brushed that suggestion aside by saying that it would restrict the operation of the clause to a tiny minority of cases. So it would, and so it should. Only then would the Government be in a position to decide the proper amount of benefit to be repaid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A third alternative, which does not appear to be in the bill and has not been suggested in our discussion so far, is to impose a threshold on settlements or awards
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0524">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>907</span>
affected by the repayment provision. I am not too bothered whether the threshold is set at £10,000, £15,000 or £20,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right to say that that option is not in the bill, but we have been told, in the usual mysterious way, that a threshold of £1,500 may be set.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What, £1,500?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I thought that that would shake the hon. Gentleman. The Government are proposing to disregard small sums, but their idea of small is not the same as the hon. Gentleman's or ours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is helpful and I am grateful to the hon. Lady. A £1,500 threshold is a joke. I am prepared to be flexible about the level, but £5,000 or £10,000 is the very least that we should consider so that inexpensive claims are not caught by the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could continue to discuss the matter at length, but the hon. Member for Derby, South has already deployed the case extremely effectively. The clause is sad and manifestly unjust. It will be difficult and costly to administer and will not improve the position of a person who has suffered injury. On the contrary, it will abolish the rights of many accident victims, such as employees who have suffered accidents at work, victims of road traffic accidents and survivors of disasters. It will make it difficult for them to get fair and proper compensation and, in some cases, to get any compensation at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the committee will divide on clause stand part. Conservative Members who vote in favour of implementing the clause should have their names engraved on the leaflets that go out to claimants who may be caught by the provision. That would be a salutary exercise, especially when they meet constituents who may be unfortunate enough to be caught by the provision in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle behind the clause is sensible. Victims of accidents should repay amounts over £1,500. Now that less benefit is coming out of national insurance, we should consider reducing national insurance contributions. Unemployment was rising under the previous Government, but they continued to increase employers' liability national insurance. Indeed, they put a surcharge on it, which this Government have sensibly reduced. That reduction was one of the motor mechanisms for getting the economy back on the road and reducing the cost of employing people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I told my Whip that I would not provoke the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will write to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as I have, to see whether the £38 million that is being saved will be put back into the pockets of employers and employees. National insurance contributions for employees could also be reduced in the Budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>908</span>
As to the five years' limit, insurance companies always drag their feet and often take four years. The fifth year might be another incentive for them not to settle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mrs. Beckett—provoked?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not exactly provoked, Mr. Winterton. Politics are an educative process, and I am privileged to be allowed to educate further the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce). It is a pity that he was not paying attention when we were debating clause 2. He should be aware that, for many years, the Government have continued to claw in the earnings' related contributions from employers and employees, which were I think primarily instituted under the previous Labour Government—they were certainly maintained then—while steadily removing all the earnings-related benefits to which those contributions were supposed to entitle people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have long argued that it is an invidious and unjust way to proceed. Creating a surplus in the national insurance fund enabled the Government to abolish the Treasury supplement under clause 2. I am pleased to lear that the hon. Gentleman does not approve of it—neither do I. The Government are conning the public and I look forward to the hon. Gentleman joining us on these matters in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At this time of year, the most I can do in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) is ensure that his remarks are drawn to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor when he comes to discuss those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite some of the comments on the clause, it arises out of a long-standing debate about the relationship between social security benefits and compensation when they are paid for the same injury. It is now well understood that, under the present rules, some benefits are offset for an award of compensation by 50 per cent under the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948 for five years from injury, irrespective of when settlement is made. Under case law, other benefits may be offset by 50 per cent or 100 per cent over the five-year period or longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The courts have regularly ruled that the victim should not receive "double compensation". I have been accused of using that term, but it springs from the judgment of courts in recent years. I did not invent it. The result is increasingly that compensators—usually insurance companies—do not have to meet the full liability for injury because the victim has already had social security benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our primary aim is to shift the burden for providing compensation back fully on to those responsible, while in most cases not affecting the amount of compensation that the victim receives. We are not taking away benefit entitlement or eligibility but simply removing any remaining double compensation from the compensation payment when it is ultimately made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is long overdue. I understand why many worthy and substantial organisations still do not welcome an upheaval, but the Public Accounts Committee
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0525">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>909</span>
and the National Audit Office have said that we should act. We are acting in a sensible and forward-looking manner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) quoted a case showing the malign effects of the clause upon victims. She quoted a cleaner who was blinded and received damages of £103,680. Under the present rules, the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council tells us that £20,000 would have been deducted; the compensator would have paid only £83,480, instead of £103,680. However, in that case and others, the council assumed that we would take into account future benefit entitlement as recoupment under the clause. That is not so. Had the case been dealt with under the new arrangements, far from recouping the £37,400 which the council suggested, we should have recouped £9,500—less than half of what was offset under the previous arrangements. That illustrates my point that in the 80 per cent of claims that are settled within two and a half years victims will be no worse off; they may be better off than they are under the existing povisions. I have hitherto refrained from suggesting that some would gain, but some would and that is a clear example. I am glad that the hon. Lady prompted me to discover the facts of that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady quoted the Parry 	<i>v</i> Cleaver decision in the House of Lords on recovering like from like and invited us to separate benefits into those connected with special damages and those for general damages. I listened with interest to the earlier debate and to the point that she made this morning but, despite its superficial attractions, I still believe that that would be an unnecessary and unworkable way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there is much confusion. That is illustrated by the fact that the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council reached so totally wrong a judgment. In those circumstances, we should stick to die principles that underlies die clause—to shift the burden on to the backs of the compensators. Although some victims may get less, others may get more. Overall, that will be sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirk wood) referred to the powers of inspectors. It is right that the Committee should always be concerned about giving increased powers to Government inspectors. We have to be careful about the rights of citizens, particularly in relation to their private affairs. I hope that I can reassure die hon. Lady and die hon. Gentleman. The point is covered in schedule 2, and there may be further opportunities to discuss it. Some papers have been sent to say that
	<br><q><p>"inspectors powers will be widened to include insurance companies and compensation papers."</p></q>
I most emphasise that, that is a fall-back provision. There are no penalties for non-compliance, except an abosolute requirement to pay the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that we find that a payment has been made but we have no record of a certificate being issued or paid. Without some power to check how much was paid, die Secretary of State would not be able to demand payment from die compensator—even if some sort of deduction had been made from the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>910</span>
victim's payment. It is only a fall-back measure because compensators are usually large, reputable insurers or the major employers. No difficulties should arise with that. Back in 1981, the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council actually urged the Government to do what the clause aims to do. At that point, the Government thought that it was unnecessary because the insurance companies could be trusted to operate in an acceptable way. I am sure that in practice they can. I accept that fully. The provision is no more than a fall-back safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of inspectors looking at the private files of solicitors or expecting to see other than a document which shows how much has been paid—and even that would be only as a last resort if the matter cannot be resolved in the normal way by corresponsdence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire need not fear the tread, on the stairs of his local practice, of an inspector who will require him to produce private documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned events still tragically fresh in our minds. The victims of major disasters, as well as of industrial injuries and motor accidents, are affected. The Clapham, Lockerbie and Ml disasters are all in our minds. However, tragic and shocking as those events are, they should not be dealt with under any principles other than those underlying the clause: people should not have double compensation, and the compensator should not be able to transfer some of his responsibility to the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dealt with interim payments earlier. Interim payments may have to be made in such cases and I am sure that we shall make satisfactory administrative arrangements. As in all cases, we shall be at pains to ensure that far from contributing to any delay, the DSS goes out of its way to minimise delay. There is no reason why the clause should add to the number of cases coming before the courts. Many factors are involved in deciding to go to court, the parties' judgments of die relative likelihood of success being perhaps the main one. Even under the clause, the vast majority of case will still be settled by informal arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stand by the principles underlying die clause. My hon. Friends should have no reservations about voting for die clause and having their names associated with those principles. They are right, sensible and will be fair both to die taxpayer and those who have suffered claims. It will put responsibility where it properly lies—on the shoulders of the compensators. Expenses for employers and companies may increase, but we are in touch with die industry about administrative costs to ensure that matters are dealt with sensibly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

During the break, I was at a branch meeting of the Union of Communication Workers in my area. I was asked questions about die Bill, the clause and die principles underlying. Those workers often suffer industrial injuries. Postmen are particularly vulnerable to assault and other accidents. They think that it is horrific and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>911</span>
blatantly unfair that someone who suffers badly from an injury at work faces a double penalty, or double jeopardy, as a result of the recoupment. I agree with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister, in all honesty and conscience, say that this is a decent and fair way to treat people going through the trauma of something as awful as Locker-bie, the Ml or any other such disaster or going through the often equal trauma of an industrial injury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On double jeopardy, from Beveridge to the most recent House of Lords decisions, and many cases in between, it has been made abundantly clear that people should not be compensated twice for the same injury. When I met the TUC to discuss the matter, I was amazed that it disputed that, and I am amazed that the local branch of the union mentioned by the hon. Gentleman should take the same view. It is an unsustainable principle that employers, who may be culpable and in some way responsible for injury or disease to work people, should be able to shift part of their responsibility either from themselves as employers or from insurers on to the back of the state. I commend the clause to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister was correct when he said how glad he was that I had drawn examples to his attention. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to check what he said, having furnished 	<i>Hansard</i> with all the copies of the documents that I used this morning. However, I am sure that the Minister is glad that he has managed to find an example which was not correctly calculated. It is rare for him to get things right more often than we do—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is not wriggling; it is merely an accurate observation, as the Minister is all too painfully aware.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just because the Minister has managed to find an incorrectly worked example does not alter the facts. It was singularly unfortunate—although the more I think about it the more I think that it must have been a Freudian slip—for the Minister to say that he was confident that in 80 per cent of all claims the victim would be in a better position than before. Not only is there no evidence to sustain that—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> That is exactly what the Minister said; it proves that it was a Freudian slip if he does not remember having said it. I wrote it down as he said it. That is precisely what the Government argued about the social security change package that they put through last April. They said that 80 per cent of all recipients of benefits would be either better off, or no worse off. That was patently untrue and it is more evident that it was untrue with every day that goes by.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will have time today to have recourse to a dictionary, because the Government make the most peculiar use of words. I was brought up to believe that the word "reform" means to improve, make better, change, strive for something good. To the Government, "reform" means to cut; it means nastiness, divisiveness and punishment. I stand corrected if I misheard the Minister, but I understood him to make the claim that people who have been through the trauma of major accidents, industrial injuries, illnesses and so on are 80 per cent better off. Even if they get a few bob together because
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>912</span>
they have lost a leg, an arm, an eye or an ear, they cannot be said to be better off. I know of nobody who has been involved in a major accident and has received thousands of pounds in compensation who feels better off. They always say, "I'd rather have my leg than any amount of money." It is incredible to use financial arguments for what can be serious injuries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Lady resumes, I shall check carefully what I said in 	<i>Hansard.</i> The only time that I can recall using percentages in the 80 per cent region was when I said, first, that 80 per cent of cases are settled within 2½ years and, secondly, that 85 per cent of cases are settled informally, without embarking on the full legal process. If I said anything else, I apologise. I certainly would not make that assertion. I shall check my words carefully tomorrow, as I am sure the hon. Lady will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that I did not write down either of those observations, which no doubt he made in response to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). Nor, indeed, was I at that point paying quite the assiduous attention that I normally pay to all the Minister's words. I readily confess that. There is no question of that being the phrase that caught my attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point is that nothing that the Minister has said answers in any way our basic argument that what the Government are doing erodes the principle of damages being paid in respect of various elements of the injury—the distress caused, and so on. The effect of the clause will almost inevitably be that in the vast majority of cases the benefit that will be recouped by the Department will erode the damages that the victim might receive for loss of earnings—in particular, for loss of amenities and for pain and suffering. That is wholly indefensible. The Minister has said nothing that would leave anybody in doubt about the basic difference between Government and Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister argued that we were talking not about double jeopardy but about double compensation, yet he has produced no evidence to undermine our contention that full compensation is not paid in such circumstances, let alone double compensation. If damages paid as recompense for pain and suffering are eroded, there is no question of double compensation being paid, because nothing in the state scheme approximates to the payment of damages in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister reiterated that we must be fair to the taxpayer and place responsibility on the shoulders of the compensator. Whatever phrases the Government use, incomprehensible as they will be to the average individual, the result is that in many cases the victim will lose. In a choice between being fair to the taxpayer or fair to the victim, we do not wish the position of the victim to be eroded any further. Victims are already at a considerable disadvantage. As my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) has pointed out, many of them have gone through terrible traumas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that employers should not be able to shift their responsibility, but that is not the point.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0527">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>913</span>
The Government will be recouping from the victim compensation that he might otherwise be able to enjoy. That is the practical effect of what the Government are doing, however they excuse or describe it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I look forward to Conservative Members writing to their aggrieved constituents when the clause comes into effect. They will have to explain what a good and sensible idea it is and how they all understood it, which is why they voted for it. I assure Conservative Members that is what I shall tell people who write complaining that they did not know about this measure, and asking why we could not stop it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in no doubt that this is a damaging clause. It is certainly not neutral, as the Minister has tried continually to imply. We shall have no hesitation in voting against it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully support what my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has said, and I hope that Conservative Members will consider her remarks seriously. Those of us who belong to trade unions have always fought for employers to accept responsibility for their own action. It was primarily the Labour party and trade unions that campaigned, always against the wishes of the Conservative party, that campaingned for such issues as compensation for accidents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not condoning bad employers or dangerous working practices—quite the opposite. We fully support the idea of getting the maximum amount of money for any accident or injury from those responsible, whether that is an employer, as small sweatshop, the Post Office, or an airline, in the case of a major accident or tragedy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that it is right that the relatively small amount of state benefit that may be paid to people during the period before their claims have been settled should then be recouped. That is a form of double punishment. We shall not be moved in our belief. As my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South said, Conservative Members writing to consitituents who are aggrieved because of a car crash, an airline crash, or a sinking ship, will have to say, "It is perfectly reasonable that your benefits should be taken back because the taxpayers' interests have to be protected." I know of no one who feels better off as a result of an accident. That should no come into it. If victims are financially better off, good luck to them, because they have gone through the problems of an accident and the horror that goes with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause is unfair and wrong. I hope that Conservative Members will think again. If not, we shall have to wait for the return of a Labour Government to repeal this part of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this and the next group of amendments, we are dealing with the point raised by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) about whether there should be a threshold before clause 18 begins to bite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 272, 277 and 278 are in a familiar form. They all question why the Bill says "may" rather than "shall" when it comes to making regulations. Paragraph 4 of schedule 2 says that regulations may make provisions exempting people making small payments from the obligation to make deductions under clause 18. As we believe strongly that, terrible though the clause is, it will be even more terrible if there is no exemption, such exemptions should definitely be made rather than just possibly be made. In that context, we suggest the the Government reconsider the wording of the provision. If the Government later decide that they want to abolish the provision that allows a small payments exemption, they should have to do it through primary legislation rather than being able to do it through the back door by repealing regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 273 relates to the provision that such small payments should be exempt from deductions "in prescribed cases". It is not clear to us why they should not be so exempt in all cases. Even if they are exempt only in prescribed cases, there will, presumably, still be a large number of cases in which the amounts of money involved are small but the bureaucratic work and the cost of dealing with such claims are disproportionately large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 277 and 278 insert "shall" instead of "may" because paragraph 4(2) of the schedule provides for the refund of deductions where they should not have been made because the compensation payments were below the small payments limit. Again, we think that such a provision should be made, so the word should be "shall" rather than "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under paragraph 4(2), refunds of deductions wrongly made from small payments of compensation might be made to "the intended recipient"—whom we assume would normally be the victim—or to the compensator, or be divided between them. Since it will be the intended recipient who will have suffered the deduction, the refund should be made to that person. That would be the effect of amendment No. 299.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 281 deals with the issue raised by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>916</span>
paragraph 11 of the schedule as it would be amended by the proposed Government amendment. It places on anyone who is or who is alleged to be liable in respect of an accident, injury or disease the duty of providing the Department with information about any person seeking compensation. Again, there does not seem to be any suggestion that that obligation might be waived if it is obvious that any compensation is likely to be below the small payment limit, although we believe that that will often be the case. An exemption from the obligation to report a name in those circumstances should be provided, and the effect of the amendment would be that, although that exemption could exist, it would lapse if it later became apparent that the compensation payment would after all be above the limit. Therefore, the Department would run no risk of losing out as a result of trying to ease the administrative burden which otherwise the schedule and clause will form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with amendments Nos. 272, 277 and 278. They are designed to require regulations to be made and ensure in a variety of ways that we insert the word "shall" rather than "may", to achieve certain ends. The use of the words "shall" and "may" in legislation is a complicated matter. We normally use the word "may" in primary legislation in order to give a freedom to successive Governments to judge what should be included in secondary legislation rather than to tie Governments in the long term to specific provisions. I can give the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) an absolute assurance that the regulations will be made and will achieve the aims that are set out using the word "may". It is a complicated, and technical matter, and it seems strange to me—I am sure that it seems strange to the hon. Lady—but I am assured that that is the normal practice in the relationship between primary and secondary legislation. I hope that she will accept that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 273 removes the Secretary of State's power to prescribe the cases where a small amount will be exempt from recoupment when he makes regulations. Let me reassure Opposition Members that we intend to exempt all payments that individually or aggregated, are below the level that we intend to set for small payments. Incidentally, I cannot yet say at what point the level will be set. The hon. Member for Derby, South mentioned £1,500 this moring. We are receiving representations about what the appropriate level ought to be, and we shall have an opportunity to discuss that in due course. We have no intention however of picking and choosing between different payments. We shall have to monitor what happens once the scheme begins, and it is customary to have a power to prescribe the cases which are to be an exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, witht the assurance that we intend to exclude all small payments that will be below the level we set in the regulations, the hon. Lady will feel able to withdraw amendment No. 273.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 279 provides that only the recipient is entitled to receive any refund. However, if the payment were small, it would be subject to the 50 per cent, offset and the compensator would be entitled to retain some of the money incorrectly recouped. It would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0529">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>917</span>
seem appropriate that the payment could be split between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 281 would leave the compensator to decide whether any claim is likely to exceed the small payment limit when he first receives it. We have sympathy with the spirit of the amendment, which aims to cut out some unproductive administrative work both for compensators and for the Department. The problem with the amendment as drafted is that if the compensator gets it wrong and has to pay more than anticipated, the Department will be faced with great practical difficulties ticking down and collating records at short notice. The scheme will work properly only if the Department is given sufficient warning to organise records and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment as it stands, but officials are consulting the private sector on the details of the scheme. The panel includes the insurance industry, the legal profession and the TUC, and we are hopeful that we can agree some formula to keep unproductive activity to a minium</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirk wood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister answer two brief questions? The consultations with industry will obviously be important. What is the timescale for concluding the consultations and enacting secondary legislation? Will they be affirmative or negative regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a solicitor, the hon. Gentleman will understand that it would hardly be wise to give an end date for any negotiation. We want to move expeditiously because we want the regulations to be laid as soon as possible after the Bill recieves Royal Assent. This is not the only matter that is being discussed with the panel. We have no reason to delay it. I am sure that those representing different interests on the panel have no wish to do so either. These are technical matters. I hope that we shall have regulations in force by the end of the year. They would be affirmative regulations and so there would be a full opportunity to debate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 199, which is linked with amendment No. 200, provides that compensation payments are aggregated for recoupment only if they arise out of the same injury or disease. This a technical point but it ensures that different injuries if they should arise are treated separately for recoupment. Amendment No. 200 is a technical amendment providing the definition for "connected" inserted into paragraph 4 by amendment No. 199.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that I did not wholly follow what the Minister said about amendment No. 279 and the reference that he made to the 50/50 division of payments between the compensator and the victim.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a refund has to be made, and it it is a small payment, the 50 per cent offset rule still applies.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>918</span>
forgetting that because it is under the limit the 50 per cent rule would still apply. I am also grateful to the Minister for stating that the Government intend to make such regulations. I accept the assurance with some reluctance, as I always think it is unwise to concede that provisions in the Bill do not have to say what one envisages that they will say. I have some sympathy with the Minister, who is being forced to say, "Well the lawyers tell me this is a technical and complicated matter which I cannot possibly explain to the Committee because I do not understand it either." I have been in that position myself, so perhaps it would be kinder not to dwell on the question. No doubt it gives the Committee much food for thought over what a fruitful area of operation there is in the law when the difference between "may" and "shall" can cause such problems.

I am concerned by the Minister's observation about prescribed cases. He said that the Government wished to take the power in case it occurred to them that they might wish to use it. I am always reluctant to give Governments powers that they may wish to use some day when an occasion comes along, without there being any indication of what the occasion might be. However, having failed to convince any Conservative Member that we should not pass retrospective, prospective legislation, I have no doubt that we could not persuade anyone to support us on refusing the Government power to make regulations in this matter. I presume that I can still withdraw our amendment, and that we can deal with the Government's amendments later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

do not recall offhand whether that figure appears in the notes on clauses. I understand that that was the limit suggested in the Touche Ross report, according to levels of payment in 1987. The report suggested also that the DSS could still recover 95 per cent of recoverable benefits on the basis of a cut-off limit of that level. It is thought that the number of potential inquiries for benefit information would have been reduced by one-third.

Clearly, if a limit of £1,500 was approporiate when set against the circumstances and levels of earnings in 1987, the limit should be uprated at least to take account of inflation and of increases in earnings that are likely to take place before the scheme comes fully into operation in 1990.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the TUC has suggested that the limit should be at least £2,500. That would exclude about half of all personal injury cases, and again would cut out many small cases where the administrative costs of recovering small amounts of benefit would be disproportionate. The Association of British Insurers suggests that the limit should be considered in the context not only of inflation in the period between preparation of the report and the beginning of the recoupment of benefit, but of the uncertainty over how long the initial limit would remain in force. The appropriate initial figure would be £5,000. That is why we put forward that figure in amendment No. 274.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that you will recall, Mr. Winterton, how many debates we have had on the earnings limit relating to occupational pensions which has stayed at £35 for five or six years. There are numerous other examples throughout the benefit system. For example, the widow's payment was already less than the widow's allowance when the figure was set in 1985 and is now substantially less. I am confident that the Association of British Insurers is right to fear that the limit, once set, will not be increased for a substantial period of time and that that should be taken into account when the limit is set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 276 proposes that the limit should be reviewed every year and increased. As we have learnt with child benefit, the duty to review does not mean anything. It should be reviewed and increased, preferably in fine with average earnings. The level of increase in earnings should be reflected in the increase in compensation which often relate to loss of earnings and therefore should be reflected in the limit itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue raised by amendment No. 275 is that of having a crude cut-off point at all. The TUC has said that a crude cut-off point would introduce further injustices between different injury victims. Victims with less severe injuries receiving a damages award of less than £1,500, if the Minister refuses to move on the level of the limit, would receive the full award and the full value of benefit entitlements, or at least part of that as under the present rules. Victims receiving above that limit could be subject to the full recovery of benefit. That could mean that some victims who are more seriously injured would receive less net recompense than others who are less seriously injured. There would also be a temptation to resolve some claims which should, in justice, be just above £1,500 at less than that because, by avoiding full recovery, the victim could be better off overall.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>920</span>
We are particularly concerned about cases that may take several years to settle. There might be an element of contributory negligence. In such cases compensation payments of several thousand pounds could be wiped out by benefit deductions and the victim could be worse off even though a fairly substantial injury had occurred. Even though it had been intended that several thousand pounds of damages should be paid, the victim could end up worse off than if he had received only a "small payment" of £1,500 or less. We therefore propose that the small payment limit should be based on the net value of the compensation payment after taking into account the benefit deduction rather than the gross value. I am encouraged to think from something that the Minister said on the previous amendment that that may not be out of kilter with what the Government intend. I would welcome clarification on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could deal, as the hon. Member for Derby, South did, with the two admendments which relate to the cut-off point and the annual uprating. As I suggested when we discussed the previous clause, I recognise that the Touche Ross figure of £1,500 was put forward in 1987. It estimated at that point that that figure would cover about 36 per cent of settlements and about £2 million of benefits a year. The TUC suggested £2,500 and the Association of British Insurers suggested £5,000. Both group are pretty skilled at negotiation on their own terms and both might feel that the figures they put forward are opening bids in a set of negotiations, but as the hon. Lady said, these matters are a year away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 276, when we set the figure I shall want to take inflation into account. It would also be much more sensible, and more convenient to have a figure that could be set and endure for some time and then be uprated occasionally, rather than every year. I cannot say at present what I think would be the appropriate figure, but I would certainly hope that those two principles that I have set out might be part of our consideration when we look at how those figures will be set. I do not think that having an annual uprating would be particularly convenient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 275 is designed to ensure that a victim does not receive less than the small payment due. The trouble with that is that it would create severe problems at the margin. One would have the recoupment provisions. The offsetting provisions would apply below the cut-off point and so just above it would be a rather privileged group who would be guaranteed minimum payment without any offsetting if we accepted the amendment. I do not believe that that would keep the relationship as smooth as it should be down the scale in this matter and I advise the Committee to reject the amendment, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He said that according to the Touche Ross report the £1,500 limit at 1987 prices would cost £2 million. It would help the Committee to get an idea of the

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have the figures to hand. I am not sure that they would necessarily be suitable for the Committee because these are matters which we shall discuss when we deal with the affirmative regulations. Discussions are in hand with the panel on this matter and others. We shall have to see what judgment is made. There will be other opportunities for discussion, but in the meantime I am sure that if the hon. Gentleman tabled parliamentary questions he would not find it too difficult to elecit some answers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With his admirable frankness the Minister demonstrated that the fear of the Association of British Insurers that once set the limit will never be increased, or at least not for decades, was eminently justified. I have no doubt that as they are skilled negotiators they will take full account of the Minister's words when they press the Government about what the limit should be. It is something that we shall bear in mind when we look at what the Government finally put before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that it is better for a limit to be set that could be increased. Obviously it is difficult to predict the movement of earnings, just as it is difficult to predict the movement of prices. The idea that a limit should be set for a substantial period of time would cause some concern. However, I recognise that we shall probably not make much headway on that now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the remarks that the Minister made about amendment No. 275. He said that the net value of the compensation should be considered so that there should not be such a sharp cut-off point of £1,500. The Minister said that the amendment would create severe problems at the margin. But it will not. They will already exit and the amendment is intended to ease them. If the Minister had said that that was perhaps not quite the right way to do it, but that he recognised the difficulty, it would be a more understandable point of view. But merely to say that he does not believe that it would keep the relationship as smooth as it should be down the scale was a wonderful example of opaque language—it meant absolutely nothing or anything depending on one's point of view. The level of cut-off and the way it should operate should be considered further by the Government. On reflection, would the Minister like to add anything to his initial remarks?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think so. The 50 per cent offset below the cut off point exists to prevent some people from being treated more favourably than those who are subject to recoupment. If people were guaranteed a de minimis payment, a hiccup or blip would be created at the margins, which would put the group just below the cut-off point in a privileged position. The present arrangements allow a smoother progression and a better relationship between the levels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, I recognise that those are technical points on which we are unlikely to make progress.

If the Committee requires divisions on amendments (a) and (b), they must take place before I ask the Committee to vote on Government amendment No. 201.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 201 is an extensive amendment, which substitutes new paragraphs 5 and 5A for the existing paragraph 5 of schedule 2. There is no change in policy but it is clear that the present wording does not go far enough to recognise the multiplicity of permutations where, in connection with a single event, the victim is dealing with a number of compensators who may bear different degrees of responsibility. The compensators may decide to act independently or separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If compensators act independently, it is possible that the Secretary of State may receive more than the amount required to meet the benefits paid to the victim. If that happens he will refund the excess amount to the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new paragraph 5 A acknowledges that compensators often wish to act together and provides for "collaboration". In allowing for collaboration, we seek to ensure that the Secretary of State does not receive the recoupable amount more than once from different compensators.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There should be little argument about the purpose of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we have accidentally caused too much to be deducted from a compensation payment because we have failed to record an earlier payment to the Secretary of State, we shall certainly refund the excess. To avoid any doubt, I am happy to accept amendment (a) and substitute "shall" for "may".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If compensators are acting together as collaborators, they will know what each of them has paid. Amendment (b) would create unnecessary paperwork because those to whom it is required to be sent will already know the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Flushed with half success, I am tempted to fall silent. I was depressed about the prospects for amendment (a) when we heard the explanation of how "may" and "shall" were used in primary and secondary legislation. However, we are grateful for that mercy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is right to say that amendment (b) concerns that strange, rather pejorative word, "collaboration". There are many other words that we could use about groups that work together in an alliance. Alliances are sometimes proclaimed to be strong and unchangeable, but sadly they can break up—I have not provoked a reaction. Partners may find that they are not working closely together but are sometimes hardly talking to one another. Such is human nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>924</span>
The Minister said that it was essential to rewrite the schedule because of the many complications, which tend to increase geometrically, so that more difficulties are envisaged. Amendment (b) would ensure that, where a collaborator should make a benefit deduction and a corresponding payment to the DSS, his partners would have to be informed. In the majority of cases, it would not be necessary because they would keep themselves informed of payments—they may work in the same building or for sister organisations—but if they failed to do so because of a fracture in their alliance, there could be an over-deduction from the next compensation payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To protect the interests of the victim, therefore, responsibility for ensuring that each of the compensators has up-to-date information on the amount of benefit already deducted and repaid to the DSS should be placed on the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the wonderful new world of a high-tech DSS which the Government promises, this may be a minor matter that can be taken into account with a sophisticated programme. The press of a button will ensure that statements are sent out in the smooth-running pattern of the future DSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned to protect the victim because, unfortunately, that lobby has no voice. Unlike many other groups such as the war widows who were here this morning lobbying for their interests, those who will be affected by future injuries, accidents and disease have no one to lobby for them. Many people speak for professional organisations, trade unions and so on, but the main casualties of mistakes and shortcomings of legislation are unknown and silent. We are delighted that the Minister accepts amendment (a) but we press for reconsideration of amendment (b).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong the discussion. Compensators are either collaborators or they are not. Collaborators will, by definition, know what is being paid on their behalf. If compensators are not collaborating, it will be up to the Department to notify the other compensators involved in the incident. If compensators had decided to act independently from the start, and in the unlikely event of a collaboration breaking down, the responsibility to inform the other compensators of any payments that had been made would revert to the Department. Amendment (b) is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not entirely reasurred. However, by the leave of the Committee, we can withdraw amendment (b) and press on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

This is another straightforward, relatively simple amendment, which would protect the interests of the victim. The circumstances dealt with in the amendment arise all too frequently, where the compensator becomes insolvent, the bankruptcy liquidation order is made, and the result is that the intended compensation payments that the victim would be entitled to receive are not paid. The victim's loss will be increased by the fact that the benefit deductions have been made from the partial compensation payments. Under the amendment, the DSS would repay to the victim the amount deducted to the extent required to make good the loss resulting from the insolvency. Compensation in this case would avoid a double loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In future, the sort of people who will be compensators are companies that are unlikely to become insolvent. We are talking about large insurance companies. I can remember one incident similar to those described by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), so I cannot say that it is impossible, but it would not be a frequent occurrence. However, if it did happen, the liability to pay compensation and to make a deduction would still exist, and we would recoup payments that are actually made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where a compensator makes, on account, one or more payments that are subject to recoupment, and the compensator became insolvent or ceases to be liable for further compensation payments, the Secretary of State would be liable to pay to the victim from monies received from the earlier recoupment, up to the amount of the further compensation due but not paid. However, I could not accept that it would be right for the Government to go further than that, and to stand in as a reserve compensator in the event of the compensators becoming insolvent. The payments already received will relate to compensation already paid and the benefits will be for past periods. In the unlikely event that this ever happens, both the victim and the Secretary of State will lose what is due but unpaid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The victim is in a worse position than the Secretary of State if losses were made on compensation that is due. As a reasonable quid pro quo for the way in which the Government are trying to avoid overcompensation or double payment in some way, the minimum compensation should be underwritten.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are depressed by the Minister's remarks. Insurance companies have gone bust, sometimes spectacularly, but the Minister seems to put the interests of the Government, compensators, or claimants to the compensators if companies go bust, on a higher level than those of the victims. A guarantee would have been helpful. In the light, twilight or darkness of his remarks, and with the possibility of returning to it later, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 282 is quite simple. We have tabled it because paragraph 11(2) of the schedule requires the victim or his personal representative to provide the Department of Social Secuity with information about the accident, injury or disease. That is fair, and understood, but it is not clear why the DSS should need any more information than it has already received in connection with the benefit claim. Information must previously have been provided if someone is receiving benefit. The amendment would ensure that the victim would at most be required to provide information about the compensation claim, not about the accident, injury or disease. We tabled the amendment because we do not see why the Bill is worded as it is. How are people expected to know about their obligations under this paragraph, and what are the consequences if they fail to comply with them? One of the problems of all social security law is providing information about rights to potential claimants or, in this case, victims. I fail to understand how they can be expected to know what their obligations are. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me assure the hon. Gentleman that there is nothing sinister in this power. We need from the victim his identity details and the date that the injury occurred, because that marks the point at which we start considering his claims. We need to know something about his injury or disease, so that we can assess at that point which of the benefits that he is receiving may be affected by the injury. Some benefits might be relevant to the injury, while others would not be affected by the injury and the possible compensation.

There will be a leaflet about the matters and notes in order books; There are no penalties for not giving the details, except that it would aid the Department to deal with these matters without delay if the information was available at the beginning of the claim.

Obviously that is highly desirable, but all of us in the Committee must be well aware that the chances are extremely high that the information would be completely incomprehensible unless accompanied by a full explanation in plain English of how the system of deduction and the payment of benefits works and how it will affect the individual—that is, the victim—to whom the certificate is being sent. Amendment No. 283 would require the Secretary of State to supply such an explanation at the same time as the certificate. You will recall, Mr. Winterton, the helpful little guide that comes with one's tax form every year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Helpful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful to me. it always tells me that I shall not be entitled to anything, no matter what, so it saves me from worrying. At least it is couched in somewhat plainer English than the form and certainly makes it more possible for people to understand what will happen. If the Government can supply something as long and detailed as that with Inland Revenue forms, they should be able to provide such an explanation with something that will be so vital to the victim of an industrial injury, accident or disease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the schedule refers only to the victim, is it intended that if the victim has, unfortunately, died, a copy of the information will be provided to the victim's personal representative? That, too, is a suggestion with practical merit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 285, if the victim applies to the Secretary of State for particulars of how the figures in the certificate of total benefit were arrived at, the figures will be provided within seven days. That is an entirely reasonable period. The provision is important because while the compensator, strictly speaking, will not need to know whether the figures are right or wrong—he will simply deduct the amount that he is told to deduct—the victim will need to know, because he is the one who may ultimately lose out. The Minister should consider automatically supplying full details to the victims rather than waiting for them to ask for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it stands, the paragraph gives the victim the right to apply for particulars but does not oblige the Secretary of State to provide them at all, let alone within a stated period. I accept that against the background of the speed with which such matters are usually dealt with, seven days may seem to be a fairly short period. However, the information should be readily available, and the need for it may be urgent if an early deduction is to be prevented. That is why we have proposed that period, but it could be varied if the principle were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of the hon. Lady's points about the information given might be more appropriately discussed in the debate on the next amendment, and I shall deal with the time limit in my remarks on the two amendments that we are considering now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the sad event of somebody having died, of course the personal representative would receive the appropriate information". In effect, amendment No. 283 is unnecessary because we shall offer an administrative solution to achieve the aim of the amendment. When the compensator advises us that he has received a compensation claim and we have checked our records, we propose to write to the victim explaining the recoupment provisions and letting him know the benefits that will be recovered. That will give the victim the opportunity to raise any questions. A copy of each certificate will be issued to the victim and that will enable him to check the benefits, periods and totals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, a number of certificates will be issued as negotiations between the parties progress and it
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>930</span>
would be overkill to issue an explanation of recoupment with every certificate. We shall also produce an explanatory leaflet, which will go to the victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 285 lays a duty on us to respond to such matters within seven days. Our aim, of course, is to deal with those matters as expeditiously as possible. It is in our interests and in everyone else's that that be achieved but it would not be right to include in the Bill a specific time limit. We need to give victims early information. That will enable us to avoid last-minute inquiries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I advise the Committee to reject both the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been relatively helpful in clarifying the Department's intentions. I certainly look forward to reading the leaflet and I feel confident that it will contain all the explanations that the Minister has given us today about how it is necessary to make deductions to avoid double compensation and how the taxpayer rather than victim has to be protected. That will make interesting reading and as I am looking forward to it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 284, in page 30, line 15, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(3A) If the victim has not received such information within 4 weeks, or such longer period as may be prescribed for the purposes of sub-paragraph (l)(a) above, of the date on which the compensation payment in question would be likely to be made if a certificate of total benefit had been issued, he may request the Secretary of State to furnish the compensator with a certificate of total benefit and the Secretary of State shall comply with that request as if it bad been made by the compensator or provide the victim with the information contained in a certificate which has already been issued to the compensator.".</p></q>
Under the Government's proposals, prompt payment of compensation will depend on the compensator having applied in good time for a certificate of total benefit. If the victim or his solictor realises that that has not been done, although the date of payment of compensation is approaching, they should be able to apply for a certificate instead of waiting for the compensator to do so. The amendment would enable them to do so within four weeks of the expected date of payment, or such longer period as may be prescribed—I am sure that that language will recommend itself to the Minister—under paragraph 12(l)(a), which specifies the period of time within which the Secretary of State is required to supply the certificate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment also provides that if the Secretary of State has already issued a certificate, of which the victim may not have received a copy, he need not issue another certificate, but must send a copy of the existing certificate to the victim. The Minister may be able to assure us that that is what the Department intends, but it would be helpful to have that on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A certificate of benefit is a document which places certain obligations upon a compensator. It would not be appropriate for a victim to be able to

apply for a certificate. On the other hand, the victim can at any time ask for details of his benefits. He can do that now and will be able to do that under the new scheme. Every time we sent a certificate to the compensator we shall at the same time send a copy to the victim or his representative. The certificate of benefit itself is notice to the compensator of the amount to be deducted from the compensation payment that is due to be made by him and only the compensator can know when he is about to make a payment and thus needs a certificate. These two provisions—that the victim or his representative will always get a copy of any certificate that is issued and that the victim can at any time ask for a note of his benefit—should meet the main thrust of the amendments. I hope that in the light of those assurances, the hon. Lady will withdraw the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take with some reluctance the Minister's point that it is the duty of the compensator to make the deduction. On the other hand, if the compensator has been less efficient than one would hope, even though the victim could apply for a notice of the benefit that he has received, that would not in any way affect the triggering of procedure. However, I take the Minister's point and I am glad that the Department intends automatically to send a copy to the victim. To allow us</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>(5) In this paragraph 'the default date' means the date on which the time limit mentioned in sub-paragraph (l)(c) above expires.".</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 206 extends the Secretary of State's power to require information when a compensator applies for a certificate of benefit. Generally, the compensator will have provided early warning about the victim and the accident or injuy for which compensation is being sought. As I said earlier, that is to enable requests for certificates to be met with speed and accuracy. However, there will be occasions when there is no forewarning and the Secretary of State receives a request for a certificate "out of the blue". When that happens, the request will need to provide sufficient information to enable the Department to issue an accurate certificate quickly.</p>
	<p>Amendment No. 207 sets out new pagraph 13(4) which is an emergency power for use when methods of communication are disrupted. That is entirely necessary because there is no reason why recoupment should be prejudiced because of circumstances beyond the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0537">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>933</span>
Department's control. In the main, we shall be dealing with factors affecting the communication of written documentation because the scheme will be based on written applications, acknowledgements and so on. The nature of the difficulties will, I understand, be referred to in the order, which will need to be renewable because we are dealing with unanticipated difficulties and we need some fall-back.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall begin by speaking to amendment No. 286. Paragraph 13 of the schedule provides that the compensator ceases to be liable to make deductions from the payment if the Secretary of State has not issued a certificate within the four week time limit. Amendment No. 286 would make it clear that, in those circumstances, the victim is entitled to receive the payment in full so that the compensator would not be able to make an estimated deduction pending receipt of the certificate, nor entitled to withold the payment altogether. We presume that that is the Government's intention, because if the failure of the Department leads to the certificate not being provided within the generous time limit allowed, it would be wrong if the victim suffered as a result of waiting for his compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the proposition in Government amendment No. 207 that the compensator will be able to make deductions even when he has not received a certificate. That development is undesirable. Although the parallel is not exact, I am confirmed in my view by recent changes in housing benefit. Local councils have been giving advice about likely liabilities under housing benefit that is wide of the mark. Since the Government made major cuts last April, many people have been in debt to the tune of hundreds of pounds. We are not keen on people being encouraged to make deductions by guesswork.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, the liability of the compensator is made unenforceable if the certificate is not issued within the time limit, but only if the application for the certificate underparagraph 13.
	<br><q><p>"accurately states the prescribed particulars relating to the identity of the victim".</p></q>
The compensator may have given what he believed to be accurate particulars, but which turn out later to be inaccurate. Even though that inaccuracy may not be important, the compensator will still be liable to make the relevant deduction. Again, that seems unreasonable, which is why, through amendment No. 287 we seek to insert into the provision the words
	<br><q><p>"or to the best of his knowledge and belief.</p></q>
I refer now to amendments (a), (b) and (c) to paragraph 13(4) of Government amendment No. 207 under which we assume that a postal strike is one of circumstances envisaged by the Government. Amendment (a) would limit the power of the Secretary of State to circumstances in which all normal methods of communication are affected seriously. It is reasonable to expect the DSS to use whatever means of communication are available, especially when new methods of communication are developing fairly quickly. Will the Department consider that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>934</span>
Amendment (b) would require the Secretary of State to specify in the order the area to which it relates. Otherwise he could make an order covering the entire country and affecting the position of all victims, even though the service by which the order is normally delivered might be disrupted in only one area, which would be unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment (c) would prevent the Secretary of State from extending such an order beyond three months. That raises the question of the consequences of making the order. Under paragraph 13(4)(a) of Government amendment No. 207, while the order is in force, no liability to make deductions in payments to the DSS would become unenforceable on the grounds that the certificate was not issued. Therefore, the compensator must delay making the compensation payment or, if he did make it, he would have to make a deduction without having been told how much it should be. That is not a satisfactory state of affairs. We recognise that, if the certificate were not issued, payment might have to be made in full and that the Government might not wish that to be the case, but the provision would encourage the Government to proceed speedily to attempt to resolve whatever difficulties had arisen. Given all the arguments advanced by the Government about the necessity for encouragement and so on, I am confident that the Minister will welcome the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should mention at this stage—in the spirit of pure helpfulness—that I have been advised that Government amendment No. 206 may be defective, albeit it in a minor way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal now with the Opposition amendments. Naturally, we have noted the hon. Lady's latter point. Amendments (a), (b) and (c) to our amendment No. 207 set out various ways in which alterations to the normal arrangements could be made in certain circumstances. It would not be necessary to write the proposals into the legislation. I hope that such circumstances will arise infrequently. If they do, the Government will make every effort to overcome the difficulties and deliver the certificates in good time by one means or another. At present, the range of transmission facilities available is increasing, and I know that hon. Members welcome that. We shall do our best to find methods by which the certificates are delivered. We do not wish to delay settlements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 286 would confirm that the victim may receive the full compensation without recoupment if the Secretary of State fails to issue the certificate within the four week time limit. We appreciate the hon. Lady's anxieties, but Government amendment No. 207 would provide that, where liability ceased to be enforceable, nothing in the recoupment provisions will prevent the compensator from making the compensation payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If amendment No. 287 were passed the obligation on compensators to provide accurate information when applying for certificates would be considerably diluted, resulting in potentially more unenforceable liabilities. The fundamental plank of the recoupment scheme is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0538">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>935</span>
for early and accurate warning to be given by compensators of their receipt of compensation claims. That will give the Government time to check and collate their records. At that time, the compensator will have provided identification particulars and will provide those same particulars when he applies for the certificate. There should be no great difficulty because of identification queries and the matter should be resolved quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, we do not want to be bound by applications for certificates arising out of the blue and containing information that is accurate only to the extent of the compensator's knowledge and belief. It would be intolerable for the Secretary of State to be bound by such constraints.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister is unable to accept our proposals. I take the point that there is nothing to prevent payment being made as the schedule will be amended. We should perhaps look further at the way in which the schedule will appear, to see whether we need to make further reference to the difficulties that we identified. Nevertheless, it should be on the record that we remain anxious that the practical operation of the schedule may still create problems for the victims rather than the compensator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 292, in page 32, line 17, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"15A. An appeal shall lie to a social security appeal tribunal at the instance of the victim or the intended recipient against the amount deducted under section 18(l)(a).".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments relate to the right of appeal in paragraph IS, against a certificate of total benefit, if the figures are wrong or the certificate includes benefit
	<br><q><p>"otherwise than in consequence of the accident, injury or disease".</p></q>
Under subparagraph (2) no appeal may be brought until the claim has finally been disposed of and the amount deducted and paid to the DSS. We are anxious that the compensator should not be allowed to delay making the compensation payment by appealing against the certificate. Nor should die victim have to wait until an incorrect deduction has been made before he has a right to appeal. That is why we wish to delete subparagraph (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 15(3) provides for regulations enabling an appeal to a tribunal against a certificate to be treated instead as an application for review by the Secretary of State. With the limited circumstances in which appeals will be allowed—they will not be allowed until after the case has been settled and the compensation payment made—they should go to the tribunal and not the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention may be to allow appeals that cannot go to the tribunal because the claim has not yet been settled to be treated as applications for review. If so, subparagraph (3) should make that clear. Amendment No. 291 would allow the appeals to be treated as applications for review, as well as appeals. That would enable the Secretary of State to issue a new certificate, but would ensure that the case goes to a tribunal if the Secretary of State refused to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right of appeal is against only the certificate of total benefit. Amendment No. 292 would provide an additional right of appeal against the amount deducted. It is not clear how straightforward the process will be, although we have raised the matter when debating other amendments covering the way in which the certificate should be prepared. It is not clear how easy it will be to judge from the certificate exactly how much should be deducted. It should not be assumed, even if a certificate is right, that the deduction will necessarily be correct or that it will be obvious how much it should be. The victim should be able to appeal against the deduction rather than the certificate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been at pains throughout the formulation of the recovery scheme to ensure that intervention by the Secretary of State does not delay the progress of compensation claims. That is why we propose that an appeal against certification can be made only when the claim is disposed of. To do otherwise would run the risk of delaying the compensation payment and no one favours that outcome. I also mention that the Secretary of State has wide powers of review and, where possible, he will try to solve any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>938</span>
difficulties on review. Amendment No. 291 would provide that appeals which cannot be varied on review are put before an appeal tribunal. I make it clear that only victims can appeal. Compensators cannot appeal in such cases. The review provisions are categoric—the Secretary of State may only vary the amount on the certificate downwards, that is, in the victim's favour. If he issues a certificate specifying a lower amount and the victim remains unhappy, he will have a fresh right of appeal. Therefore, we see no need for this amendment as the victim's interests are properly covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 292 is somewhat of a puzzle because paragraph IS specifically provides for appeal tribunals to deal with appeals about the amount of deduction. This amendment adds nothing of substance to the proposed appeal mechansim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 209 caters for appeal rights in a special category of award—provisional damages under the Supreme Court Act 1981. An appeal will normally be possible only after a final payment has been made, but a provisional award recognises that the victim's condition may deteriorate. It may be a final award, but it may not. The amendment ensures that the victim has a right of appeal once the main provisional award is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment No. 211 amplifies the enforcement action where there are two or more compensators who are jointly and severally liable to pay the Secretary of State. In particular, it provides that the ceiling for each individual compensator is the amount of the compensation actually paid by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the concern behind amendment No. 293, but clause 18 places the liability to pay the Secretary of State firmly on compensators. The amendment is unnecesssary because the victim has no liability in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no quarrel with the amendment. I am partly reassured by the Minister's remarks as he rightly deduces from our amendment, that
	<br><q><p>"no amount recoverable from a compensator by virtue of this paragraph shall be recoverable by him from the victim."</p></q>
We saw in the power the danger that a compensator, unscrupulous or othewise, would seek to regain money from a victim. If I understand the Minister, that point is covered in the clause and our amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we may take amendment No. 296, in page 34, line 8, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(1A) Any expense incurred by die intended recipient in complying with the provisions of subsection (1) above shall be reimbursed by the Secretary of State.".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This raises what one hopes may be only a minor issue, as probably only few cases will fall within the category. However, the few people caught by the provision in paragraph 19(1) may face substantial problems. The proposals in paragraph 19 are indefensible, or so it seemed to me when I first studied the schedule during the Christmas recess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 19 says:
	<br><q><p>"Where the compensator is not resident and does not have a place of business in Great Britain,"</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>940</span>
that could also mean that he—did have, but no longer has, a place of business in Great Britain—all the obligations imposed on compensators in Great Britain under clause 18 and schedule 2 will instead fall on the victim. Paragraph 19(2) gives the Secretary of State the power to modify the requirement in such cases, but we have been unable to discover how such powers might be used. Unless the regulations provide otherwise—there is no sign that that is intended—in these cases the victim will have to notify the Department of the claim and apply for the certificate of total benefit—although it is far from clear how he is expected to know when to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The victim will have to decide whether the compensation payment is a small payment, and to calculate from the information in the certificate how much ought to have been deducted and to pay that amount to the DSS within 14 days. The whole cost, and onus, of doing those things will fall on the victim. In some cases, as the paragraph is drafted, the compensator—particularly perhaps in a case where he is no longer in business in Great Bitain but had been—may have applied for a certificate and deducted the benefits from the compensation payment. Yet even in those cases it appears that the victim will be responsible for repaying the benefit to the DSS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The excuse for paragraph 19 given in notes on clauses is that:
	<br><q><p>"Where the compensator is outside Great Britain, enforcement of any liability is likely to be difficult, if not impossible".</p></q>
In other words, it would be inconvenient for the Department to go through the process where the compensator has no presence in Great Britain, but what might be inconvenient for the Department will be 100, or 1,000 times more difficult for the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite wrong for the Government to say, "Because it is a bit difficult for us as a Department of State, don't trouble us. You, the victim, can carry out the duty."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are cases in which enforcement would be possible or where the compensator voluntarily complies with the provisions. For example, does Northern Ireland come within the compass of the paragraph? If it does, surely the Government cannot be saying that an employer in Northern Ireland should not be required to comply with such provisions? If difficulties arise in such cases, the Department ought to take enforcement measures. The difficulties and costs involved will be insignificant to the Government but may cause considerable work and worry for the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 296, we are worried that if we are unable to persuade the Government to change this part of the schedule and the victim must carry out the required procedures without assistance, expenses may be involved. If the victim must employ someone to carry out the procedures, the expenses will be much greater. The victim should be able to reclaim such expenses. After all, the deduction is made for the convenience of the Department, not for the benefit of the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 296 is part of the wider matter of costs. It seems that the Government intend to make no allowance for the victim's costs. Even if a large
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0541">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>941</span>
proportion of the payment by the compensator constitutes costs, the entire payment will still be liable to be taken by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will happen if the victim's costs are met by a separate payment by the compensator? The Minister did not make that clear on Tuesday. The Government's approach to costs is difficult to defend. Costs that are insignificant to the Government may not be to the victim. The Minister should agree to consider the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On amendment No. 296, the hon. Lady said that the cost to the Government would be insignificant. In my view, the cost to the individual would be insignificant. It would involve no more than a couple of postage stamps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The victim will receive his payment from the compensator and no deduction will be made for the benefits that he has received in this country. He will simply have to apply for a certificate and, having received it, send it to the Secretary of State with the required amount. There will be no need to communicate with the foreign compensator and no legal, medical or other costs. The process is simple, and I cannot conceive of anyone needing professional advice. It in no way compares with the additional record-keeping and calculations that a corporate compensator will have to carry out as a result of recoupment. I cannot advise the Committee to accept amendment No. 296.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On amendment No. 294, it is a case of simple equity that a person who has received benefits in this country but receives compensation from another country not subject to our legislation should not be treated differently under these provisions. If we became aware of a payment from abroad, we should expect to be told about the amount and paid. That will entail practical difficulties, which we shall try to resolve before regulations are made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is no answer. The Minister said that no deduction will have been made from the compensation paid. How does he know? The claim may have been discussed over a considerable period. At the time that the incident occurred, the compensator may have been doing business in this country but may subsequently have withdrawn. He may have made a deduction because he understood that he was expected to do so, but he may not have gone through all the proper procedures. As a result, there may still be an obligation on the victim. How will that difficulty be avoided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a victim received the money and applied for a certificate, any deductions would have been reflected in the certificate that was sent back. The amount shown on the certificate would be the amount that the victim had to pay to the Secretary of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely that depends on whether the deductions were paid to the Department. It could happen that the compensator makes the deduction and tells (he victim that he has to pay the money to the Department. He could then leave the country without a care for the liabilities to the Department and, if the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>942</span>
Department still wanted its money back, the victim would be liable to pay it under paragraph 19. That may not arise very often. Let us hope that it never arises. But the Minister should consider whether there could be a residual and unfair liability on the victim, as that is not appartently what the Department intends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me back to amendment No. 294. The Minister says that there is no problem and asks why if someone is injured perhaps overseas, the repayment should not be made? That is not the point. If the Minister is pushing through clause 18 and this scedule on the grounds that the Department ought to get back the money paid in benefits because of the overriding duty to the taxpayer, the duty should rest on the Department, not on the victim. Whatever the Minister may say about the simplicity of the scheme and how easy and straightforward it will be for all these matters to be handled, they can doubtless be handled a great deal more easily by the Department than by the victim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is just not good enough for the Minister to say that it does not matter if the liability falls on the victim. Unfortunately, I think that there will be cases where the business is outside Great Britain, whether it always has been or whether it is by the time that the payment comes to be made. The Minister's argument is no justification for putting the responsibility for the payment on the victim rather than the Department retaining the responsibility to try to recoup what it sees as its money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A quater of a loaf is perhaps better than none. I cannot accept amendment No. 294. I am bound to say that the possibility had not occurred to me of someone deducting the amount but not paying it to the Department. I shall consider that and see whether that aspect might be tackled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that, although I remain of the view that the responsibility for getting its money back ought to rest with the Department rather than the victim.

The amendment relates to paragraph 20 of schedule 2, which deals with the modification of the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948. The Act provides that in assessing damages for personal injury, half of the main incapacity and disablement benefits payable over five years is to be taken into account, but only against the damages for loss of earnings or profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 20 will affect that provision in three ways. First, benefits will be deducted only in the case of a small payment. In other cases, the damages will be assessed without any deduction for benefits, the deduction taking place at the point of payment rather than assessment. That change is an essential consequence of clause 18 if deductions under section 2 of the 1948 Act are to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, half of all benefits repayable under clause 18 will also be deductible from small payments under section 2 of the 1948 Act. That change is, on the whole, beneficial, in view of the ruling of the other place in Hodgson 	<i>v.</i> Trapp, which we have discussed more than once and which states that attendance and mobility allowances are deductible in full, not just 50 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our quarrel is with the third change, which means that benefits will be deducted from the whole of the damages, not just the damages for loss of earnings or profits. That change is detrimental and could result in attendance allowances or invalidity benefits being deducted from damages for pain and suffering. The amendment would delete paragraph 20(l)(b), which extends the deduction to the whole of the damages, because otherwise that provision will be inequitable and detrimental.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is accepted, a further amendment should be made on Report introducing the "like from like" principle into section 2 of the 1948 Act so that, for example, attendance allowance is not deductible from damages for loss of earnings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, the amendment restrict the offsetting arrangements that would continue to apply to small payments to the special damages element of the award.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In amending section 2 of the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948, we have applied it to small payments and the same range of benefits to which recoupment applies. That means that vicitms will gain over the present system and that no benefits will be offset by 100 per cent, as at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, in essence, takes us back to the principles which were debated fully when we discussed the amendments to clause 18 on special damages. What I said about recoupment on that subject applies equally to offsetting. It would be wrong to make the distinction for offsetting which we are not prepared to make for recoupment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said, replacing the case law with a 50 per cent offset in the legislation will improve the position of some victims, and it would be wrong for the offsetting to be out of line with the main recoupment provisions. I shall not weary the Committee by going over the arguments, as they were fully explored when we dealt with clause 18.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most people have families, and unemployment benefit is paid to the family.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would apply to all the income support payable.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The nature of the schedule has changed. It was bad enough that people who get compensation should lose the benefit that they gained having been made unemployed because of an accident.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, there is no change because the same arrangements apply for offsetting for recoupment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that people came to an agreement about offsetting and that deals were done—the term is "horse trading".

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. As the point had not occurred to any of us, we did not raise the issue. The way in which the Minister replied to my hon.

I am like my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) that, the more we consider the matter, the more anxiety we feel about the way in which the Department's decision to claw back 100 per cent of benefits might affect the level of damages to the extent that it might erode damages awarded for pain and suffering, for which there is no compensation under the state system. That is much more likely when benefits payable to the whole family are being considered. The clause is even worse than we thought, and I wonder how many Conservative Members are wondering wryly whether they should have so readily applauded it when they voted for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot accept that. The principle that we are applying is that all the benefits that become payable as a result of the accident should be subject to recoupment. At present, income support that is payable not just to the individual but to the family as a whole is off-set against the compensation paid. We are discussing off-setting in the amendment, so below the cut-off point when the arrangements arise, 50 per cent will apply rather than 100 per cent against income support that operates now. There is no fundamental change except in a beneficial direction in that it is SO per cent rather than 100 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was worth while tabling the amendment because it exposed another area of injustice in the clause, and the disparity has disturbed us greatly. We referred to the difference between compensation and the purpose for which benefits are paid. Those are entirely different. Compensation is not awarded on the number of children in the family or someone's family commitments. There is no connection between the two. We should like the opportunity to cogitate at length, so I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 299, in page 34, line 32, after "payments)", insert
	<br><q><p>"and which is a case prescribed under that sub-paragraph".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>946</span>
I refer to the new subsection (1A) which paragraph 20 of the schedule adds to section 2 of the 1948 Act. Deductions will be made under section 2 only when the damages do not exceed the small payments limit as prescribed under paragraph 4(1). When the amendment was drafted, we did not know what response we would receive to our earlier amendment asking what the prescribed cases were likely to be. The Minister said that he did not know, but had taken the power in case something came along. I accept that that is not quite how the Minister put it, but that was the tenor of his observations. Nevertheless, small payments would still be subject to deductions under the 1948 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case it is decided that there are instances that do not come under the small payments exemption, that would mean that they were subject to the 100 per cent deduction and obviously they should not be subject to the 50 per cent deduction that remains under the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948 as weir. We seek to ensure that that could not happen. The Minister feels that the Government will not need to use the powers to prescribe cases. I am confident that he will tell the Committee that he will try to ensure that if such powers are used there should not be treble deductions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is already aware that we have provided that the 50 per cent offsetting arrangements will continue to apply to small payments. These have been extended so that all the relevant benefits will be offset by 50 per cent instead of the current situation where some are offset by 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words of the amendment simply repeat what is said in the new paragraph 1A, set out in paragraph 20(2) of schedule 2. There it is already quite clear that the payments to which the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948 apply will be small payments prescribed under paragraph 4(1) of schedule 2. The new words would do nothing to the meaning except to provide some circularity which would cause confusion. Therefore I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I accept the Government's argument. However, far be it for the Opposition to add to the confusion in Committee this afternoon on the Government Benches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are discussing small payments exemption, I wish to probe further whether invalid care allowance could be deducted when payments are not exempted and are subject to deduction under the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
