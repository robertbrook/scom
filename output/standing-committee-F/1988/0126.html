	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Islington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is nice to open the batting on a good wicket. I am sorry that I am slightly puffed. Unfortunately, due to the Government's obsession with free enterprise and the underfunding of London Regional Transport, the Circle line broke down this morning. As usual, thousands of Londoners are paying the price for the obsession that the Secretary of State for the Environment has for the free enterprise economy. I am sure that the whirlwind will be reaped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16 is a fairly straightforward technical amendment. I hope that the Minister will concede the principle of it even if he quarrels with some of the wording. I shall recap what I said on Tuesday. Unemployed people over the age of 60 have national insurance contributions credited to them automatically up to the end of the tax year in which they reach the age of 64. Those contribution credits can be of great importance in protecting their pension rights and those of their widows. Until this year, loss of unemployment benefit as a result of the occupational pensions abatement did not affect entitlement to credits because the abatement affected only those over 60. However, from 1 January 1989, those aged 55 to 59 are also subject to the abatement but they do not have the same entitlement to automatic contribution credits as those over 60. As a result, they stand to lose not only unemployment benefit but part of their pension rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister confirm that that is the case? Does it apply to all those aged 55 to 59 whose entitlement to unemployment benefit is eliminated by the abatement or only to some of them? This is clearly an anomaly; it is unfair on those people. The Minister probably understands that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can reply speedily to the hon. Gentleman. The amendment would award unemployment credits to all occupational pensioners aged 55 to 59 whose unemployment benefit had been wholly abated by their occupational pensions. I entirely endorse the sentiments expressed by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) but I cannot accept the amendment because it is unnecessary. The change is not needed because people aged between 55 and 59 who are signing on as unemployed are already entitled to class 1 credits. The fact that their unemployment benefit has been abated or wholly extinguished because they are receiving an occupational pension does not in itself affect the matter. There is no need to make a change in the law because there is no problem to be resolved, as the hon. Gentleman feared. I hope that he will find that reply acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment proposed, clause 6, page 4, line 9, at the end insert the words on the order paper. The Question is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I had begun to put the Question. I will not finish putting the Question, but hon. Members must attract my attention before I put the Question otherwise I will have no alternative but to put the Question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for that, Mr. McWilliam. I blame it on London Regional Transport. I understood from what the Minister said that if the people concerned are not already signing on, they would have to sign on in future. That seems a little unreasonable. People over 55 are clearly not going to be able to find work and are, in effect, in retirement. Instead, they are being told that they must sign on, for five years in the case of women to claim this entitlement. That seems slightly unfair, which I should not have thought was the Minister's intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention is to keep arrangements as they are. People between the ages of 55 and 59 who are not in work and are therefore not paying national insurance contributions through their employment are awarded credits by signing on if they are seeking work, or if they are sick and unable to take up work, or in receipt of an invalid care allowance. We do not wish to introduce any distinction between individuals in this matter, even for those whose unemployment benefit has been totally abated because they are receiving a substantial occupational pension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister is saying, but is it necessary or sensible to make people in that age group sign on when the Minister knows full well that their chances of obtaining work are slim? Should those people have to go through that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister and I clearly have a different view of this matter. However, as the amendment was designed simply to probe the Government's intentions, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0091">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 38, in page 4, line 36, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Regulation 28 of the Social Security (Unemployment, Sickness and Invalidity Benefit) Regulation 1983 shall cease to have effect.".</p></blockquote>
This is rather different from the previous one amendment, although it could also be described as a probing amendment. It seeks to repeal the regulation that provides that days on which someone is not entitled to unemployment benefit because of the way in which his occupational or personal pension has been abated under the clause should count towards the 312 days for which unemployment benefit is payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That regulation was made under a power conferred on the Secretary of State by the Social Security (No. 2) Act 1980. I believe that it was only regulation made under that power. During the Committee stage of the Social Security Act 1988, we moved an amendment which sought to repeal the regulation-making power, thereby nullifying the regulation automatically. The then Under-Secretary of State who was replying to the debate, the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Portillo) said that the regulation-making power might be needed to increase the occupational pension limit. So this year we have tabled a rather different amendment, which does not attack the power itself, but only the use that has been made of it so far. At the time, the Under-Secretary said that he would consider the matter, but there was no opportunity to return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We remain of the view that the regulation is objectionable. There will probably be few cases in which someone who has lost entitlement to unemployment benefit because of the abatement could subsequently become entitled to it again. However, it could happen if the Government had a fit of generosity, or we persuaded them to uprate the £35 limit. In those circumstances, it seems wrong that people who have never received the benefit should have the days when they have not received it counted aginst their full benefit entitlement which is, broadly speaking, for nearly a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That would occur only rarely, which means that the cost involved would be negligible. I hope that the Minister will agree to reconsider the issue. I am encouraged to think that he may be prepared to do so, because of an unusual occurrence last year when the Under-Secretary replying to the debate did not say at all what we expected. I do not mean that he said, "This is a wonderful amendment", and accepted it immediately. If he had, the disconcerting thought that perhaps we had not moved the right amendment or that it had a wholly different effect from the one intended, would have occured. When we pressed the then Under-Secretary to say a little more about regulation 28, there was a ghastly hush, which made it plain that the Under-Secretary would prefer not to say any more about it. As Opposition Members are very nice, we did not press him further. We understood that he would like time to reflect and would come back to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
I hope that I am not breaching a confidence if I tell the Committee that, afterwards, the Under-Secretary quietly informed me that the note that had winged its way to him during that exchange said, "I am sorry. I am afraid the brief is wrong." I hope that that will not happen to the Minister this morning. If he thinks that there is any conflict between what we think the amendment would do and what he thinks it would do, I hope that he will agree to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has moved that amendment pleasantly. I wish that I could agree with what she said. She implied that the operation of the present system was not clear, so perhaps I should say a few words about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, as the Committee knows, unemployment benefit is extinguished entirely when the occupational pension for a pensioner with an adult dependant reaches £88, so someone with a pension of £89 currently loses all unemployment benefit. From next April, however, with the increase to the unemployment benefit rate, the benefit will not be completely extinguished on pensions below £91.10, so the person with an occupational pension of £89.00 would then become entitled to unemployment benefit of £2.10 a week in respect of any part of his normal unemployment benefit year that is still left.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without the regulation that the amendment seeks to delete, people with an occupational pension that fully abates their unemployment benefit could become entitled to unemployment benefit if the level at which the abatements bites is raised, even if this was after the normal 12-month period of entitlement to unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that were done as the hon. Lady recommends, the result would be unfair compared with the effect on someone whose unemployment benefit was reduced to a very small amount. That person would have exhausted entitlement and could not claim if the limit was raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Lady that only a small number of people would gain by the amendment, but our argument is not based on cost. Moreover, the amendment would benefit those with a more substantial occupational or personal pension and, as I explained earlier, the Government do not feel that this group is the best target for extra benefit at present. Therefore, I cannot recommend acceptance of this amendment. I am sorry that we have been unable to find common ground on this amendment, especially as it is the last on clause 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point but, he is, nevertheless, being a little unfair. If I understand him correctly, a person may have drawn £1 of unextinguished unemployment benefit for the whole period to which he was entitled. If the limit were then raised, that person would not gain, whereas if our amendment were accepted, a person who had not extinguished his entitlement would gain from the raised limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, if the Government were ever to raise the limit, it is unlikely to be by a massive sum. Unless it were by a massive sum, a few people who would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0092">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
have had their benefit entitlement extinguished might become entitled to a little unemployment benefit, as in the Minister's first example. In other words, a few people who had been cut off from any benefit might have the possibility of enjoying £1 or £2 of unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10. 45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is saying that if that happened, it would be unfair to the person who had drawn the original £1 and might under the amendment be entitled to £3 or so, but it seems to me to be a marginal difference. In defending that marginal difference, the Minister is defending the proposition that someone should lose all possibility of drawing unemployment benefit because he theoretically exhausted his year even though not a penny of benefit has ever been paid to him. That is at least as illogical a proposition as what we have put forward, which he claimed is illogical and a little unfair. It is a dubious principle to disentitle someone from receiving the benefit that they have never in practice been able to draw because of the increasingly tight operation of the limit on the abatement. However, I have little doubt that even if we discussed it all morning we should not shift the Minister from his view. Having aired the subject and had the Minister consider our point, have I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT: REQUIREMENT TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT ACTIVELY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the amendment, I point out that it is extremely broad, and the way in which the debate goes will determine whether the Chair allows a clause stand part debate on clause 7. That is entirely in the hands of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I draw you a little further on that, Mr. McWilliam? Also, I beg your pardon: I should have given you notice that in a moment I want to raise a point of order and I hope I am correct in doing so at the start of our consideration of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely understand the Chair's view and we are conscious that it is likely that in probing as to exactly what the clause means we may stray fairly wide. Nonetheless, I hope that you and your co-Chairman, Mr. Winterton, will bear in mind that although it is not a new proposition, it has not been aired for some time and it is likely that we shall want to probe at length, on our amendment, as to exactly what the clause means. It is also likely that the answers that we receive from that probing may lead us to return to the whole picture at the end of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We understand that you do not want the Committee's time to be misused, Mr. McWilliam and Opposition Members have no wish to do that. However, I hope that you will be as lenient as you
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
can be in considering whether to allow a clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to my point of order, which I hope I am correct in raising now. I am not sure whether you have had drawn to your attention, Mr. McWilliam a new note on clauses that has been sent round by the Department. With it is a letter from the Minister. Before we start the debate on the amendments and the clause, it would be helpful if we could have clarification of what the note on clauses means. I say that because, at least in my copy, there are two points where the letter appears not to make sense. The bottom paragraph on page 1 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"has no intention of taking any steps to find employment will any question arise to be put to the AO"—</p></blockquote>
the adjudication officer—
	<br><blockquote><p>"about his entitlement to benefit be put to the adjudication officer at the start of a claim."</p></blockquote>
It seems to me that either there is something missing there or there is something in there that should have been taken out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a later caution in the first paragraph of the following page which refers to the claimant continuing
	<br><blockquote><p>"to receive benefit (or be credited with contributions)."</p></blockquote>
Again, that does not appear wholly to make sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious to clarify what the Minister is doing. When the text of the letter is compared to the notes on clauses, we see that in the original notes on clauses it was intended that benefit should continue to be paid pending a decision on the claim. The new notes on clauses contained in the letter do not say that, and appear to raise the possibility that the Department does not intend to continue to sue the power to deem someone to be actively seeking work in those circumstances. Will the Minister clarify what the Department is telling us in the new notes, and will he correct the letter so that we can be clear about his explanation?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The amendment is extremely broad, and the Minister will be able to answer all the points raised by the hon. Lady during the debate on it. Procedurally, we must proceed to the amendment in that circumstance. The Minister will have ample opportunity to reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish also to say to the hon. Lady that decisions on clause stand part are taken after the debate on the amendment, not before. I would not seek to prejudge the decision. I was merely firing a warning shot so that hon. Members are aware of the possibility before they begin to speak to the amendments. The clause is broad and there is a lot in it. That will be taken into consideration before a final decision on clause stand part is taken by my colleague—I suspect next week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that you have answered that point, Mr McWilliam.

	<br><blockquote><p>"(1AA) Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Secretary of State shall make and lay before Parliament a report on the operation of the 'genuinely seeking work' condition of entitlement to unemployment insurance benefit between 1924 and 1930.".</p></blockquote>
Your warning shot has hit its target, Mr. McWilliam. I shall keep to the specific meaning of the amendment. We hope to hit our target with equal accuracy and to confine our comments to the history of the concept of actively seeking work, because that is not new.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is worrying that the Chairman has said that it would be possible to discuss the whole clause under the amendment? In discussing the amendment we shall seek to explain the history of an attempt to act similarly in the past, but that does not take us into the detail of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Let me clarify what I said. I did not say that the whole clause could be debated under the amendment, but that the amendment being so broad, and taken with the other amendments tabled on the clause, makes for a wide debate on the clause. That is the point that I was trying to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). I am sure that it will be possible to discuss all the repercussions of the clause under subsequent amendments. Our debate on amendment No. 27 will show that the clause seeks to repeat an historic error, and will concentrate on what happened in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our duty is to learn from the past. I shall not repeat the perverse political morality of using alleged sins of omission and commission in the past, particularly the period up to 1979, to justify the mortal sins of the present. We hear such arguments almost daily in the House. Somehow, it is felt in this place that venial sins of the past justify mortal sins of the present. We do not seek to do that today. We want to hold up a mirror to the unhappy 1920-33 period. We shall be able to see clearly from the image in that mirror what will happen now. That time shows us that past that the Government are attempting to recreate. The rule about genuinely seeking work was almost as infamous as the household means test. Both remain as a living, painful wound in the memories of many who lived through that time. We should consider why the rule was introduced then and why it was subsequently discarded, why it was almost universally hated and why it caused so much waste, confusion and injustice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the rule was first introduced, unemployment was ballooning at a rate that caused great fear, not only among the unemployed but in the Government and in Parliament. There was a debate that lasted many hours. The rate at which unemployment was then increasing was unaparalled in history. We do not accept what the Government tell us repeatedly about unemployment, but if we can discern anything through the distortions and fiddles of the unemployment figures that have become routine, it
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
appears that there is now a genuine drop in unemployment and that the trend is in the opposite direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only three months ago did the real level drop below 3 million, according to the constant accounting figures, but because of the Government's various mathematical conjuring tricks and classic methods of trying to reduce the numbers claiming benefit without .reducing unemployment it is impossible to judge objectively the precise decrease. Despite that decrease unemployment remains at an anacceptable level. When the rule was introduced in the 1920s there was an acute crisis. The conditions were unique then and they have not recurred, even in the past 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As happened in the 1920s, the Government will again introduce into our law an alien concept—that a person is guilty until proved innocent. People will be considered work shy spongers unless they can prove that they are not. When the rule was in force there was turmoil and constant criticism of its application. We shall argue that it may not have been applied as harshly then as the Government intend to apply it now.

In my area there is a strong memory of those days. We are often told that in order to receive their benefit, men in the valleys of south Wales had to demonstrate that they had visited the neighbouring valley the previous week. There are many anecdotes about the men of the Rhondda Fach crossing the mountain to the Rhondda Fawr and meeting on the way the men from the Rhondda Fawr marching to the Rhondda Fach. That meaningless ritual continued for a long time. There is abundant evidence that the test of genuinely seeking work, when examined by the referees and in the labour exchanges, proved to have become a meaningless incantation. People interviewed were asked where they had applied during the previous week and they would give a long litany of all the firms in the area. In the inquisition that followed they would have to back up what they said by giving details, such as who the manager was and what he looked like. That became the routine for many years. One observer at the time said that if the information given by those who were examined in Sheffield were correct, every employer in the area would have received 10 job applicants for every minute of every hour of every day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality was different. In the reports written at the time there is clear evidence that the only people who suffered as a result of the rule about genuinely seeking work were those who told the truth and said what they really had done. I presume that the Government's target is the great mythical group of workshy spongers. Sch people would have escaped. Glib, clever people will continue to evade the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their efforts to make propaganda acceptable, the Government present every problem as a solution. No crisis is presented as an error that has arisen over the past 10 years. Every case is presented as a Government solution. We are told again and again that the Government will crack down on football hooligans. The Government show no shame about

	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
the crises that emerge. For 10 years we have heard the repeated cry that they are about to crack down on scroungers. They now have to find a new way of putting a populist line into legislation so as to appear to be doing as they say. The experience of the past leads us to believe that they will miss the target again, either because the method will not be successful or, in many cases, because the target is not there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be pointed out that the level of pursuit of those who cheated the system was rather more successful under previous regimes than under this Government. There is no question but that genuine malingerers should be pursued and punished. There is no difference between the two sides of the Committee on that point. We feel equally vehemently about that, although possibly for different reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the conditions that existed when the matter was examined by the Morris committee, which reported to the House in 1929, and at the rules at the time. They laid down a number of conditions. The fourth condition was that the unemployed person was genuinely seeking work but unable to obtain suitable employment. The other conditions will have a familiar ring. The man—the regulations use the word "man"—had to have made 30 contributions as an insured contributor. He had to have made application for unemployment benefit in the prescribed manner and proved that since the date of the application he had been continuously unemployed. He had to prove that he was capable and available for work. He had to prove that he had been required by an insurance officer, in pursuance of the regulations made under the Act by the Minister, after consultation with the board of education, to attend any approved course of instruction under the regulation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the attitudes and the problems that people grappled with in the 1920s are precisely the same as those of today. Our debate on the clause mirrors what happened then. Let us look at the experience of the past and the lesson that was learnt rather than rushing to a damaging judgment based on our present prejudice and lack of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory condition that the claimant should be genuinely seeking work was considered by the Morris committee. It regarded it as the prime issue that needed to be examined to reform the law. At that time, when the labour exchange thought that a vacancy existed it issued a green card which the potential employee had to take to the potential
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0095">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
employer. Details were then recorded on the card as a form of proof. What happened in practice was very different. The system was not operated on a regular basis. The mass of interviews that took place were an enormous waste of time for the unemployed and the civil servants. The civil servants consequently neglected their main task, which was to counsel the unemployed and persuade them to look for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were doubts about the claimant's search for work, the matter was considered by an examining body. The main determining factor was the applicant's state of mind. A judgment was made—it was called a leading decision of the umpire—which was considered crucial by the Morris committee. The following paragraph appeared in the judgment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In considering whether a person is genuinely seeking work the most important factor to be ascertained is the state of the applicant's mind. If a person genuinely wants work, i.e., really prefers working for wages to living on benefit, it is probably that she"—</p></blockquote>
a female was being judged—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is genuinely seeking it. But if a person prefers benefit to wages, or is content to be without work so long as she receives benefit, it may be presumed that she is not genuinely seeking work. Action is guided by desire, and whilst few people genuinely seek what they do not desire, most people genuinely seek what they really desire."</p></blockquote>
From those words it is clear that in practice, then and now, the only satisfactory decision that can be made without knowing the details is the state of the claimant's mind. There are no guarantees in the Bill that a person's phone calls will be logged by the firm that receives them, or that applicants' letters will be answered. A purely subjective judgment will have to be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the existing availability for work tests, it is already the state of someone's mind that counts. The instructions given to supervisors in unemployment benefit offices state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The question is not whether there is employment available for the claimant, it is whether the claimant is available for employment."</p></blockquote>
It is the same principle—it is not a question of whether there are jobs, but what is in people's' minds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. We are hoping to develop that argument later. The condition requiring people to be genuinely seeking work was superfluous and unnecessary, and we are afraid that the same is true of this provision. We hope that the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) will become obvious from an examination of the provison and the experience of history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the letters that we have received on the clause from some elderly people, we see that the condition of entitlement roused feelings of great distress and anxiety. Unemployed people felt humiliated by the questions that they were asked. But they felt a deeper humiliation when, in order to pass the test, they had to lie routinely. Their self-esteem collapsed. They had to make the pilgrimage every week looking for jobs that did not exist or trying for jobs which they were not qualified to get because of age or disability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>130</span>
The special cruelty was that although unemployed people—many of whom were unemployed for longer periods than is the case today—might have come to terms with being unemployed, they still had to face their failure on a weekly basis—which could become a daily basis. In addition to the daily insult that society did not want them, unemployed people felt the special, sharp sting of rejection as a reminder of their own failure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Simon Burns	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Chelmsford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seek clarification on one point.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was introduced in 1920 and finally disappeared in 1932–33.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it was introduced in 1920, why does the amendment just pick out the years between 1924 and 1930?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is that we seek to gain from the experience of history. The period from 1920 to 1924 was one of maximum crisis, in which many things were acceptable, whereas the period from 1924 to 1930 was the period when the Morris committee reported and the "genuinely seeking work" condition was put to the test. The lessons from that period will be of great value to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend, I am speaking from memory.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The legislation was first introduced in a staccato fashion and some factors were removed during the three-year period from 1930 to 1933.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that the provision applied to all claimants from 1924 to 1930. Is he aware that, from 22 January until late November 1924, the first Labour Government were in power? I presume that the first Labour Government amended the rules to make the provision apply to all claimants. How does the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) for his beautiful illustration of the perverse morality of the use of history in this place. If a certain Government did something bad in the past, that should not justify a future Government doing it. We are nearly back to the time of the last Liberal Government, which we could mention to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), if he turns up.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0096">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
I started by explaining the special circumstances that existed in the 1920s. Before 1924, there was a more hated rule—the household means test—the mention of which, when I first attended political meetings in the 1930s, sent a shudder around the room. All the participants remembered it as an indignity, when furniture or pianos were taken away from people's houses. The introduction of the "genuinely seeking work" condition coincided with the Labour party's abolition of the household means test, and such an exchange was acceptable at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also remember the fear and the ballooning of unemployment at that time. The figure of 4 million unemployed was unparalleled in history and remains unparalleled to this day. The Government were afraid of insurrection by working people. The unemployed could not be paid, even at the low rates that prevailed at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now the Government tell us that unemployment is dropping rapidly—we admit that it is dropping slowly—and the coffers are bursting with £2.7 billion. The Government are so well off under the national insurance scheme that they have reneged on the practice that has existed since 1911 and are dropping their contribution to national insurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is very important. First, the first Labour Government was a minority Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was still a Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Secondly, my hon. Friend would agree that in the course of history people make progress, but sometimes, when we look back, it was not good enough. We are not saying that our party was perfect in the past, but it has always been better than every contemporary Tory Government. We learn from history, and we seek to improve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) is a member of a party which was represented by Chamberlain, who appeased Hitler. We could go on like that all day. Of course that was not good enough. This cheap-skate point passing is not the same as trying to learn from the errors of the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not like sedentary interventions, particularly of that sort. I hope that hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one more thought to put to my hon. Friend and, through him, to the hon. Member for Chelmsford. I am certain that, 10 or 20 years from now, honourable Tories in Britain will look back with deep shame at the Government and at the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) is ambitious to suggest that he has caught us
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
on the hop. We are aware of what happened in history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far the Committee has been conducted in a spirit of intelligent reasonableness—sadly rare in the House. I hope that that spirit will continue. We shall never claim that our party and labour Government have been infallible and that our record is immaculate. We are not going to rewrite history, but we seek to establish a clear picture of history from which we can learn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sweet reasonableness of the Committee depends almost entirely on there being virtually no contribution from Conservative Back Benchers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At our first meeting, my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) asked Conservative Back Benchers to break their Trappist silence. Perhaps he will regret having said that, unless Conservative Members come up with more constructive comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have chosen the period from 1924 because that was the time when all claimants were taken into the orbit of the genuinely-seeking-work test. It was a period of constant ferment and criticism of that test. We should learn from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall end by considering some of the recommendations of the Morris committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 21 of the Morris Committee report notes that from September 1929 the insurance officer at the employment exchange could not disqualify a person for not genuinely seeking work unless he had first referred the question to a board of assessors. There were some safeguards even in that hated scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the insurance officer disagreed with the recommendation of the board of assessors he could not give a contrary decision himself, but has to refer the papers to the chief Insurance Officer. No similiar safeguards seem to have been included in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 24 of the report explains the interviewing arrangements:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Normally, interviews do not begin on a regular basis until the claimant has been unemployed for some time—ordinarily 60 days—and they take place thereafter at intervals which may be as long as 60 days of benefit, but if for any reason doubt arises earlier, an interview will take place then."</p></blockquote>
We do not know how often people will be summoned for interviews about whether they are actively seeking employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the criticism in the Morris report was of the fact that the test involved a judgment on the applicant's mind. We shall face a similar test now. Adjudication officers will not accept uncritically a list of firms to which the person claims to have written. If they do, we shall repeat the error of the past, and the glib or plausible will escape through the system. Will the Minister explain whether, if the applicant provides a list of firms which he or she has written to, telephoned or visited, the adjudication officer will want to know whether those statements are true and whether the person really wanted the job for which he or she applied. That is the crucial test. Someone may say, "We have been to X, Y and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0097">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
Z," but there may still be doubt about whether it was a genuine application, whether the person really wanted the job and whether the approach to employers was calculated to produce the offer of a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The claimant's state of mind was a crucial factor in the 1920s and it is likely to be a crucial factor in the 1990s. The lesson of history is that the application of the genuinely seeking work rule and the "availability for work" test is cruel, unnecessary, futile and wasteful. History is our tutor in that regard, and we should learn the lesson to which it so clearly points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I congratulate the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) and Opposition Members on finding a device that is within order and on giving us the history lesson to which the hon. Gentleman has just so eloquently treated us. Before I deal with the main thrust of the amendment and his argument, I shall deal with two other points that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I hope that we can eliminate from our thinking in this Committee the belief that anyone is suggesting that the majority, or the vast mass of unemployed people are somehow workshy and deliberately not doing their best to get back into employment. Nobody has suggested that. I was at great pains in my concluding remarks on Second Reading to say that only a minority of people could conceivably be so described and that of course the majority of people are anxious to get back into employment as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, on the point about the glib excuse being sufficient and people being able simply to come in with a good story and get away with it, benefit officers, claimants advisers and adjudication officers have been around for some time. They know the state of the employment market in their own locality and the opportunities that are—or in some cases are not—available. They will be in a position to judge how genuine is the nature of most of the information that they are given. Also, of course, there will be provision—as one would expect—for checks to be made on the stories, if the adjudication officer or benefit officer have doubts. I do not believe that a simply willingness to lie, deceive, cheat or be glib will be a way round the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the Minister's first point, the Government say that only a small minority of people attempt to evade getting a job. How can he possibly excuse putting in place a series of measures that require all sorts of decent, hard-working people—including a lot of older people who have worked all their lives from the age of 14 to 55—to jump through all those hoops and be humiliated because, he says, a small number might not be seeking work? How can he possibly justify that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not recognise within the existing provisions or those in the Bill anything that is designed to humiliate people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall read you some letters later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>134</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me digress for a moment. The hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) put forward on Second Reading the concept of a contract between the state and the individual. Obviously the state has a role to play in seeking to encourage people into employment for their own good and that of their families, so that they have a chance to provide for their old age and for many other needs. The task of the state is to seek to create job opportunities, to compensate those who are properly insured through benefit, if they are unemployed, and to provide a backup through income support for those without means. The state also has the task of advising and guiding people towards available job opportunities. But surely the unemployed person has a duty, as his part of the contract, not to sit passively waiting for a job to turn up but to take active steps to seek work. That is the essence of the clause, and it is a thoroughly reasonable proposition. The hon. Member for Newport, West, who described it as "alien", is out of touch with what the vast majority of people believe. Most people would expect the unemployed to take active steps to get back into employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right to say that most people feel that the unemployed should seek work actively. He would also be right if he were to say that many people have no idea of what the law now requires, or of how it operates. If many people believe that the present law does not require the unemployed to look for work, that is largely because of the propaganda put about by Conservative Members, not because such people know anything about the law in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to draw on the experience of the working of a similar provision in the 1920s. The Minister says that he does not believe that anything in the Bill or in the test as it existed in the 1920s is designed to humiliate people. He went on to suggest that the measure was designed to help and persuade people into work. The law already requires people to look for work and there is already provision for them to be helped and encouraged. We are talking not about provision but about a form of compulsion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Lady's intervention will be short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Mr. McWilliam, it will. The lesson of history and of the amendment is that whatever the test may be designed to do, in practice the test—both in its original form and in its new form—did humiliate and will humiliate people and cause enormous hardship. The reason why that happened in the 1920s is the same reason why it will happen in the 1990s. The test is not linked to whether work is available. The test is designed to examine people's efforts without considering whether those efforts are utterly pointless. That caused humiliation and resentment in the 1920s and it will do so again in the 1990s.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I believe that the Minister is a decent man and does not know what he is doing. If he does know, that is unforgivable. He is giving us assurances about how people will be treated. The Bill says only that regulations may be made. We know that the Minister's words are not worth anything without the regulations. Will he tell us when we shall see them? Can we believe his assurances? When shall we be told anything that will mean something?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady knows as well as I that the Bill must be passed before we can have regulations. I hope to ensure that the regulations follow as soon as possible after the Bill receives Royal Assent. There will be opportunities to discuss the regulations then. I see that we shall debate later the form that those discussions ought to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand why the amendment seeks to ask the Secretary of State to make and lay before Parliament
	<br><blockquote><p>"Within three months of the passing of this Act … a report on the operation of the 'genuinely seeking work' condition of entitlement to unemployment insurance benefit between 1924 and 1930"</p></blockquote>
when two such reports already exist. Those are the Morris report on Procedures and Evidence for the Determination of Claims for Unemployment Insurance Benefit, which was published in 1929 as a command paper and to which the hon. Gentleman himself referred, and the Royal Commission's report on Unemployment Insurance, which was published in 1932. Those reports are already available to parliamentarians and members of the public who want to see what happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was right to say that the main criticism of the system during those years was that it required the authorities to determine the claimant's state of mind. That is an extraordinarily difficult thing to do. The Morris committee said that it believed that it was impossible to know the state of a man's mind but none the less thought it right that a claimant should make reasonable efforts to find work. That is what clause 7 suggests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We agree with both of the Morris committee's findings. We are not attempting to judge the state of a man's mind, but we shall judge his intentions by his activities to seek work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Morris committee's report still publicly available from HMSO?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is certainly in the Library.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not what I asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is that I do not know. I should be surprised if it were still in print, but it is available in public libraries, reference libraries and the House of Commons Library. People have access to it, whether they are parliamentarians who are debating these matters or others who are carefully following them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's other complaint about the period for which he wants a report was that people were forced—that is the word he would use—to search for work when there was none. It was an inflexible system. As I said to the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), we intend that people who judge these matters should take account of the state of the local labour market when determining whether the steps that they are asking the claimant to take are suitable and amount to actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am anxious to learn from the lessons of history. The fact that we are not using the "genuinely seeking work" condition—which requires judging the state of a man's mind—and that instead we are asking that apt steps should be taken, shows that we have learnt from the lessons of that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of people believe that we are taking a reasonable step towards encouraging, persuading—even cajoling—people back to the opportunities that employment can provide and that we are not in any sense trying to bully or humiliate them into taking steps that will not benefit them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to read a letter from a man who lives in Salford. It is relevant to the amendment because it portrays the same attitudes as those that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said existed in the past. Of course, it described the existing system rather than the tightened system that the Bill advocates. I shall not give the man's name for obvious reasons. His letter is addressed to his local restart team and says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am in receipt of your printed letter requiring me to see you on 20 June re your Restart scheme. I find the final paragraph quite offensive and, before submitting my 'good cause', would point out that as I do not receive unemployment benefit, social security or any kind of Government assistance, the threat of stopping them is quite irrelevant. As for my credit contribution—"</p></blockquote>
Many older workers who cannot get a job and who are not entitled to benefit are still subjected to restart to see whether they should still receive credits towards their pension entitlement:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am 59 years old, worked from the age of 14 to 46, and consider it's the least you owe me for the loss of my savings scrimped over the years for a retirement which looks less and less favourable every day.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>As for my 'good cause for not coming', I am happy to explain it. It's something I feel quite strongly about, and something about which I mean to create quite a fuss."</p></blockquote>
he then says that he is forwarding a copy of this letter to his local Member of Parliament, my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East (Mr. Orme). The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I refer to the jobs you advertise in your Job Centres—Social Services jobs. For example, driving jobs paying approx £80 weekly."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0099">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
He is referring to the old community programme jobs. He is not entitled to benefit because the Government are fiddling with the figures, so he cannot even get one of those jobs. He continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Before my unemployment benefit ran out, I applied for one advertised, and was told by the interviewer to come back after my dole money ceased, as I was not eligible for the job until then."</p></blockquote>
That was because he had not signed on for long enough then to be eligible for a job on the scheme.
	<br><blockquote><p>"This I did, applying for a similar driving job for Social Services. It turned out I was again ineligible because … although I was not in receipt of dole money, I was also not in receipt of social security payments! The jobs are solely for people receiving social security, so that they can be taken off the list and reclassed as 'employed'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>My good cause for not coming is self-explanatory. I am not on your unemployment roll. I am not on your social security list. I am totally useless to you in fudging the statistics. So I am complying with government rules, existing on my wife's earnings and my savings. My wife retires in November. She also has worked from the age of 14, first to bring up our family and then to save for our worry-free retirement! Now, when we have reduced our meagre savings to an acceptable poverty level, we can look forward to coming cap in hand with our begging bowl to become one of your social security statistics.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I've given you my good cause for not coming to see you. Perhaps you will give me your good reasons for the folllowing:—</p></blockquote>
The writer goes on to ask about the justification for discriminating against people like him regarding community programme jobs. He asks:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Do JobCentres exist to find jobs for unemployed people, or only certain categories of unemployed people?"</p></blockquote>
I put it to the Minister—and I hope that it touches him—that that is what is happening under the present system. That is what people are going through. The Bill will make the process worse, and the Minister should be deeply ashamed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady referred to humiliation. The claimant whose letter she has read—I do not want to go into every detail of it—was asked to attend a restart interview. I do not believe that that is humiliating. The restart programme's record has been remarkably successful. I have in front of me the figures covering 28 March to 25 November 1988. During that period, restart carried out virtually 1.5 million interviews. Of the people interviewed, 89 per cent, had offers of jobs, and 74 per cent, of them acceped their offers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady bear with me so that I can make my point? Those figures show the remarkable success of the restart programme, which benefits the economy and the individuals involved. To describe the process as a humiliation rather than an opportunity for people to get back into employment is a perverse use of the word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister looks at his piece of paper again, he will find that what he has just said is wrong. The people interviewed were made an offer—that includes offers of one-week restart courses, places in job clubs, places on schemes, and so on. Only about 0.7 per cent, of those people get a job. That is a minute proportion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister does not wish to mislead the Committee. Research shows that most people
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
think that they have to go on the various schemes on offer, but only a very small majority get jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I said jobs, I meant offers, which includes of course the whole range of options that are available to them—jobs and training opportunities alike—all of which are further steps to getting people back into the employment that we believe they should be seeking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have already been raised, particularly by the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns). I am sorry to see that he is not with us, but no doubt he will carefully read every word in the record. He spoke about the historical period when, and the way in which, the test was first introduced in the 1920s. We cannot make the point too often—I should not be surprised were my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) to make it again—that by definition, because the test was new in the 1920s, there was no experience of how it would work. It is the experience of how it worked, not how people then thought it would work or what it would mean, that causes us to have such anxiety and to wish the Government to look at the historical lessons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, the test was extended to all claimants in 1924, but as part of a considerable package of measures. I have a feeling that we have not heard the last reference to the first Labour Government, otherwise I would not bother to give the Committee a slightly longer account of the period. Such references appeal to those who do not want to bother studying the subject but think them a good crack to slip in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chelmsford rightly identified that Government as the first Government in which the Labour party participated. Not only was the Labour party not the majority party in the Government, but it was not even at that stage the largest single party—that was the Conservative party, which had just lost the election. The Labour party was merely the largest single party that fought the election on a free trade ticket—or whatever it was that both the Liberal party and the Labour party fought the election on. There was no question of the Labour party having the majority to carry through the measures in the form that it would have wished.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West said, the household means test was causing enormous distress among the unemployed. The main priority of the incoming Labour Government was to seek to remove it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) who raised the point, is not here now. I think he could have added to his somewhat scant knowledge of early Labour party history. My hon. Friend appreciates how Labour Members feel when the name of Ramsay MacDonald is mentioned in connection with the 1924 Government. I think that his first comment on hearing that he was going to form an Administration was that every duchess in London would wish to be with him today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0100">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Labour movement does not have happy memories of that period. Indeed, one of Ramsay MacDonald's colleagues, Jimmy Thomas, is not well remembered by the Labour movement in my constituency since by his activities he deprived Labour of the record of holding my seat for 80 years. The only break in that record was when Jimmy Thomas—who had, of course, been elected as a Labour Member—defected and went into coalition with Ramsay MacDonald.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think his contribution to showing his firm dedication to Socialism was to say, "George V treats me like a real pal."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot better that and I fear that if I were to be drawn further, Mr. McWilliam, you might call me to order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That first Administration had as its overwhelming priority the relief of the household means test. Being nowhere remotely near the majority, obviously they had to put together a package that would enable the removal of that test. It contained a variety of measures, including the increase in benefit rates, the virtual suspension of the then conditions on contributions and the removal of any limit on the duration of benefit. It also included the seeking work test, which is the historical predecessor of the one in the Bill. The existence of that test at that point was of no real importance. There was no experience of its workings. The only people who objected, to their credit—they did so with increasing vehemence over the years—were the Independent Labour Members who sat for Scottish constituencies. Almost from the beginning they bitterly resented the way in which the test was applied. The reason for that has considerable significance for the Committee. The law applied no differently in Glasgow than it did in the rest of the country. But day-to-day practical application of the law was much more severe in Glasgow than elsewhere. That was not accidental but the result of a deliberate, behind-the-scenes decision. Conditions of employment in Glasgow were very poor, so an attempt was made to use the law to drive people to seek work elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is making a good point here. Has she had an opportunity to read Wal Hannington's book on that period, "Ten Lean Years", in which he outlines in very moving terms the conditions in which some people had to live? That could apply equally today. Central Government took powers unto themselves to remove local committees which were not prepared to carry out their policy in the operation of the formulas to determine what "genuinely seeking work" was and the operation of the means-tested schemes. In towns all over the country local committees were removed when they opposed central Government diktat on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting and pertinent point. The lesson of history is that it is not merely what is written into the law that causes concern, although we find it objectionable, but how it is used in practice. Part of the experience of the 1920s and
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
1930s was that the measure operated differently in different parts of the country but that was not to the benefit of claimants. Because of the circumstances and the way that the test was used, the ILP Members in Glasgow had earlier and longer experience of what it meant. They began to oppose it first because they understood first what it meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Chelmsford quite legitimately poked fun at the idea that a Labour Government introduced the test. I offer him another target for his humour. The TUC saw nothing to which to object in the test as it was initially introduced. Its workings were little appreciated. The TUC was just as anxious then as it is today, just as ordinary people are, to see that no one should defraud the scheme or bring it into disrepute for the genuine claimant. The TUC considered that it seemed workable in theory. Only when the test was experienced in practice did the difficulties emerge. The very Minister who had presided over the introduction of the test complained as early as 1925 about it, saying that people were being refused benefit on grounds which the originator of the 1924 Act certainly never dreamt would be used. It was not the framing of the legislation but its working in practice that caused the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister told my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) that he did not accept that it would be those who were readier with a glib excuse who would find it easier to justify themselves under the test. I would look at that the other way. I am not so much concerned with people who may find it easy to present their case, but with the great bulk of people who always have some difficulty in presenting their cases. Perhaps it is hard for hon. members to appreciate that. By definition, few people elected to this place are not articluate to some degree—	<i>[interruption.]</i> All right, we can all probably think of one or two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Lady will not name names.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perish the thought, Mr. McWilliam. Perhaps we can think of one or two—a tiny minority as the Minister might say—who, although they may be articulate,, may not have demonstrated that for some time. On the whole, we can take it as a fairly general rule that hon. Members do not have much difficulty finding the words with which to express their feelings and views, however inappropriate those views are. Perhaps it is paticularly hard for a professional politician to appreciate the enormous difficulties that many people have expressing themselves, particularly in the terms laid down by people who are also fluent with words, although perhaps more on paper than in speech. It will be difficult for many people to pass the test.

neighbour of whom they might do well to be afraid. Those people seek help with filling in forms, and approach such matters with great trepidation and fear. That happens even when there is not much at stake, never mind when faced with a form that might place their whole livelihood at stake.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer the Committee again to the lessons of history.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Morris report summoned up the experience of the period and referred to the way that the test worked in practice. It drew attention to the answers on which claims for unemployment benefit might depend. The report said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"whilst a good workman who resented the kind of question addressed to him might give a bad impression, another who was self-possessed or possibly had been carefully coached for the task would be successful."</p></blockquote>
I know thousands of working people—good, honest, decent people—whose greatest fear is that they will face unemployment. Nevertheless, they would bitterly resent being questioned—even by a sympathetic person—about whether they were looking for work, when the fact that they have been looking for work and have failed again and again, weighs on their hearts like a stone. If the Minister does not understand that the test is humiliating, or the problems that it will cause, the only conclusion can be that he has no imagination. I do not think that of the Minister, I think that he prefers to avert his eyes from the facts, and hope that it will not be like that, but it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People may be hurt by the questions, even if they are put sympathetically. However, there is no proof that the Department of Employment or the Department of Social Security will invariably employ sympathetic people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon.

	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He has put his finger on the reason why it was right for us to table the amendment and allow the Committee to consider the lessons of history. We can try to put before Conservative Members the experience of others even if we cannot in this short time add to
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
their direct experience. The lessons of history are all to apposite. What happened with the previous test suggests that the Minister's hopes are less likely to be fulfilled than our fears are to be confirmed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause and the amendment go to the heart of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) correctly referred back to the period 1924–1930. One could even take a more distant period. The newspapers from 1920 to 1924 show what kind of political atmosphere brought the original measure about. The boom at the end of the first world war was followed by a slump, and people sitting in restaurants, salons and drawing rooms in the south-east of England said, "Of course, there is plenty of work if only those people would go out and look for it. We need a Government that will force them to do that." Such people often claimed at the same time that they could not find enough servants—possibly because they paid such low wages. There was an obsession with the idea that there were enough jobs to go round if only people would get off their backsides and go out and look for them. We hear the same argument today. It is repeated in the pages of the 	<i>Evening Standard, The Sun</i> and other such scumrags—I use that word advisedly as it correctly describes the latter newspaper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not true that there are enough jobs to go round. The economic system is run like a casino or lottery, so that many people in work work extremely long hours in dirty, dangerous, unhygenic conditions. Despite high unemployment, the average working week has not been reduced and is not being reduced. Levels of overtime are high. It is easy to criticise people for working long hours of overtime and causing others to be unemployed, but I do not blame them for doing that. The pressure is on them to make enough money to feed themselves and their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I blame a Government who say that as the free enterprise economy provides enough jobs for everyone, they will impose conditions, such as those in the Bill, to force people to go out and look for work. They know that the jobs are not there to be found, yet they keep up the pressure. Because the Government continually say that the jobs are there to be found, that becomes a truism for them, so they feel that unemployment figures have to be brought down by some means. If the figures stubbornly refuse, as they have done since 1979, to go down in real terms what can the Government do?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could change their economic policy and adopt a strategy that included an element of planning, public investment and public control over the economy. They will not do that because their political philosophy relies on the free enterprise economy, the destruction of the industrial base and the promotion of financial services and of secondary and tertiary types of employment. Therefore, they have to kick the poor and the unemployed to show that unemployment is decreasing. I believe that 15 changes have been made to the method of preparing unemployment statistics.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0102">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
There have been 22 changes to the method of calculating unemployment levels. Luckily, once a month, the unemployment unit produces valuable statistics based on the pre-1979 figures, which show the difference between its method and the Government's method of calculating unemployment figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the large number of cosmetic attempts by the Government and their apologists to deflate the unemployment figures, they are still twice as high as they were when the Government were first elected in 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Unemployment, even in the Government's terms, is more than twice the 1979 level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the amount of money that the Conservative party and Saatchi and Saatchi spent on posters saying, "Labour isn't working". People brought in from an advertising agency were shown queuing up outside an unemployment office. I also remember the articles that were printed in 	<i>The Sun,</i> the 	<i>Daily Express,</i> the 	<i>Daily Mail,</i> and other newspapers about the economic disaster and failure of the Labour Government in 1979, when the unemployment figure was 1.2 million. I criticised that Labour Government for that level of unemployment. I was not proud of it. In retrospect, however, those were halcyon days. There are now twice as many unemployed, according to the Government's statistics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the real measure of unemployment—the unemployment unit's figures—show a significantly larger number of people out of work in every part of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituency is near this place. If the tubes are working—today they are not and I have suffered but I shall come back to that later—I can reach my constituency in about half an hour. It may surprise Conservative Members that, in my inner London constituency, in the midst of what is supposed to be the wealth of London and the south-east, the unemployment level is some 20 to 22 per cent., according to the unemployment unit. People in my constituency are told that there is loads of work in London and the south-east, and the 	<i>Evening Standard</i> shows several thousand jobs on offer. But there are insufficient jobs for the number of unemployed. London and the south-east has the largest number of unemployed, partly because it is the most densely populated region. Moreover, the available jobs and the types of jobs being created do not necessarily fit the people who are unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities are usually blamed for driving out small manufacturing and craft industries by putting up rates. But it was the property boom, deliberately encouraged and engineered by the Government, which drove such industries out of London. Anyone who owns a building that could be used usefully for making furniture or clothing, or for electrical repairs, knows that he can make a lot more money by selling the site for development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, in London and the south-east, we have the loss of jobs in manufacturing industry and large
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
numbers of people unemployed with no possibility of finding suitable work because the suitable work is simply not there. Sectors that have been encouraged to expand, such as financial services, are not suitable for someone skilled in furniture making, engineering, electrical manufacture, jewellery or watch making, or any other industry that has suffered badly. During its existence, the Greater London council recognised that and set up the Greater London enterprise board as an economic model for London and the south-east that was designed to match the needs of the unemployed by providing work for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have abolished the GLC and attacked it for spending that money on industrial development. They have instead spent a great deal of money advertising their ludicrous slogan about creating the skills of the workers to match the jobs that are not there, or some such gobbledegook. Yet the Government know that they are doing the very opposite. Will the Minister think carefully about what is proposed in the "genuinely seeking work" formula?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), I see many constituents who come to me in a very nervous state. Some of them have the misconceived idea that I am a figure of authority. I wish that I was. I wish to God that I had some control over what goes on in government and in Department of Social Security offices. My constituents may view me as a figure of authority at first, but, when they have been with me for a while, they realise who is in charge and what must be done to get rid of those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my constituents who have been genuinely out of work for a very long time have been put through a humiliating experience. They have been called in for interview, put through the mill and told in no uncertain terms that there are plenty of jobs available. But, when they are sent out to look for those jobs, they discover what the rates of pay are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill—and this clause in particular—is a strategy that will mean humiliation for unemployed people and will force them to come off the register and accept very low-paid jobs. That is the reason for the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many ways of alleviating the situation. The function of social security should be to provide a safety net and guarantee of decency for people who are out of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether any Conservative Member has ever been out of work for any length of time. Some Opposition Members have been out of work from time to time, for long and short periods. No one wants to be unemployed. People do not enjoy waking up in the morning, thinking, "Oh, God. Another day where I've got nowhere to go," and seeing other people going to work. It is not just the poverty involved but the humiliation of not being seen as a useful member of society. To an unemployed person, other people seem very busy and appear to have lots of money to spend. If unemployed people have families to support, they are eligible for benefits as long as they can find out which benefits are available and how to get them. Then those people are told that they have to be "genuinely seeking work"
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0103">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>145</span>
to qualify for benefit, as if they do not genuinely seek work otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the provision is intended to force people to accept jobs for wages lower than the benefits that they would receive if they were unemployed. The safety net is being taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Social security legislation cannot solve all our economic problems. But it can and should provide a safety net: it should provide a minimal standard of living and some decency for people who are out of work. Unemployed people should be found work to do. That can happen if we press the Government for an economic system that recognises the worth and value of everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a mad system in London at present. The public sector is being cut back because it is told that it is prolifigate. All the public service jobs that used to be available are being cut, so the services are getting worse and worse. Houses are not being repaired, streets are not being mended, buses and trains are not being maintained and stations are not being cleaned. There are serious reductions in services for the needy, the elderly and the disabled. Hospital and local authority services are being cut, all in the name of some nonsensical economic system that says that, if it does not make a profit, it is not worth having and so should be closed down and the staff made redundant. We have a crazy situation where needs are not met and the unemployed cannot find work because of an economic model which says that one of the top priorities is to cut public spending.

I am sure that at least some Conservative Members will have read the history books, if they have no experience of the time. They will look back at the misery, the horror and the degradation that unemployed people suffered in the 1920s and the struggles mounted by unemployed people such as the national unemployed worker's movement and the hunger marchers. Those people were not a suppliant group looking through the window saying, "Please give us a job." They were saying, "We have a contribution to make to society and want to make it. We are not pleading; we are demanding." If Conservative Members look at that period and at the Bill, they will recognise that history is repeating itself. There is growing anger and resentment. There is also disillusionment among many poor and unemployed people. But that disillusionment can quickly turn to anger. It can be turned to productive anger and to genuine political protest and political moves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must realise that they are creating an underclass of people who are losing out on the consumer boom, on the property boom and on the job market. But they are people with brains; they have thoughts and ideas. They are getting extremely angry and they are looking for a society that includes them and their children and does not dismiss them, as do the Government. Four and a half million people are now officially living below the poverty line. Several million others are very near that poverty line. They feel extremely angry at the growing divisions in society. They see something wrong in a consumer
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
boom for the minority with more millionaires than ever before yet more people sleeping on the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is designed to bring some sense and rationality to the debate. The Minister represents a constituency that was once represented by John Dilke. John Dilke understood. I hope that the Minister understands and will be prepared to concede that the Bill does the opposite of creating a decent and fair society. It creates a miserable society and damages those people who are poor and at the bottom end of the scale. We wish to see a better society. That is possible, given the political will to achieve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister think that it is a crime to be unemployed? It is obvious from the statistics and the contributions that have been made to the debate that people are made to think that way. One third of my constituents receive benefits of some kind. That leaves them without dignity. These people are humble. They do not want to be dependent on welfare. They are looking for a light at the end of the tunnel and searching hard for jobs. It is easy to see how they are hounded through the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had a great deal of experience in working with social security offices and trying to protect the most vulnerable people in society. A trade union representative once brought me a memorandum issued by the DSS which was sent out to the snoopers who work for the Department. According to the memorandum, there is a surplus store containing spy glasses, Wellington boots, cameras and so on to help them get evidence to prove that people are not seeking employment. That is the kind of society that the unemployed live in and that is the sort of hounding carried out by Government Departments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely the Minister reads the statistics in Department of Employment surveys. Those surveys make it clear that 91 per cent, of the job vacancies in London are taken up by job seekers. Only 2 per cent, of the long-term unemployed get jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, it is not the case that people are not looking for jobs. The survey states clearly that 73 per cent, of the unemployed people surveyed had looked for jobs in the previous week. The statistics are in the Minister's Department. Some of the jobs available paid sweat-shop rates. The abolition of wages councils means that employers are getting people to work for wages that are as low as possible. That is why so many millionaires have been created since the Government came to power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do the unemployed prove that they are "actively seeking employment"? What is the definition? How is it explained? When we discuss "welfare dependency", we should realise that some people are a giro away from starvation. Only last year, in my constituency, the giros stopped coming through the door on Monday mornings. People did not offer cheques and cash to help the poor—they opened up soup kitchens. In 1988! We are returning to the 1920s and the 1930s. The Government's figures will supersede the figures for the 1930s. Some people were backward-looking then, but we are not now. The Government should be more compassionate. We know lies when we hear them. We know that it is hypocrisy to say that jobs are available. We know
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0104">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
that they are not, and that is what the Department of Employment is telling us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where do we go from here? Are the Government really telling people that the Bill seeks to balance the books? The statistics show—and that is why I say that your figures will supersede those of the 1920s and 1930s—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's figures show that from 1987 to June 1988 of 173,268 claims referred, 81 per cent. were disalowed. The Bill is about saving money, as my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said. The Government have saved money on every Bill that they have presented. They saved billions with the Social Security Act 1988 and this Bill will save billions, instead of investing money to create jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill will save some money, but does my hon. Friend agree that that is not the Bill's primary purpose? To take a phrase from immigration—another area of unjust legislation—the Bill's "primary purpose" is to pressurise people so that they accept work which increasingly pays less and less. Since 1979, we have seen an enormous growth in the number of people working for low pay. That is the Bill's purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend raised that point. The two surveys on London show that two thirds of the people were not seeking the average wage; they were seeking only half of it. The Government say that the average wage is £245. But two thirds of those surveyed said that they sought wages of around £150 a week. Those people are being very fair, and the Government should not introduce a Bill that will hound them and take away their dignity; they should look at the miserable amount of benefit that they give to those people and possibly double it this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. It is important to understand the period in the past to which this amendment refers and the parallels in the existing situation—which is, of course the Opposition's reason for moving the amendment. I hope that the hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) will listen, because clearly he does not understand the working of the labour market. I may be able to help him so that he can then understand what we have to do to make our country better than it is now for such a large minority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at the number of vacancies at any one time, one has also to look at the flow of vacancies—how quickly they turn over and for how long jobs are vacant. If the hon. Gentleman asked the job centre in Golders Green or examined any of the research, he would see that the turnover of vacancies is quite rapid and that the overwhelming majority are taken by people who are already in work and looking for better jobs—more convenient jobs, better paid jobs, or whatever.

The Government's own survey of the London labour market—and I am sure that a distorted briefing has been served up to Conservative members

of the Committee—shows that there is discrimination by employers against people who are out of the labour market, particularly the long-term unemployed. There is doubt, suspicion and an attitude of, "Why are they unemployed? We don't want them; we want to employ someone who's already got a job because we know they're disciplined." That is the way our labour market works, and all the research shows that. The hon. Gentleman should go back to the Golders Green job centre and ask in detail about the turnover of vacancies, the skills and qualifications of people who are getting jobs, and the kind of people in his area who are not getting jobs and the reasons for that. If he did, he would see that although there are changes and broadly the economy is better and general living standards are higher than they were—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is making a serious point. It is true that the longer that people are unemployed, the more difficult it is for them to get back into employment. One reason why we have been developing the training schemes and why we have restart and all these measures is to help people who, because they have lost contact with the job market over a long time, may be ill-equipped to search for jobs, to present themselves properly and to get back into employment. We have taken those positive steps because we recognise that it is a problem, but it is a problem that we are addressing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. That is Government rhetoric, and I know that taking those steps would be the right thing to do. As the Minister knows, I have worked in this sector for many years, long before I was elected to this House. The measures and schemes that have been assembled for the unemployed have been dominated by the Government strategy to use schemes to lower people's wage expectations and reorder the labour market. Those schemes have been in place since the time of Lord Young, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who was then the chairman of the Manpower Services Commission, now gone, and the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit), who was Secretary of State for Employment.

Tory Members believe that we get a more efficient economy if we have more inequality. As we always point out, there is a contradiction, in that they say the very well off have to pay less tax, be richer, and have more incentives to work harder, and be better entrepreneurs and the poor must be squeezed and more desperate to work harder and be more productive. That is the Government's essential inspiration. They believe that lowering wage levels for the large minority of the population will create a more efficient economy that will lead to more economic growth. They have used all the schemes deliberately, increasing pressure to force people into increasingly cheaper schemes that cannot provide adequate training and with lower and lower wage expectations. Training costs money, as all of us who have had the luck to have good educational and training opportunities know. That has not been on offer. On the whole, the schemes have been about

reorganising the labour market and the Government have been supremely successful at it. The problem of high unemployment is not the only problem. We also have a massive problem of people working for poverty wages. Forty per cent, of the people in work earn less than the Council of Europe decency threshold target of two thirds of average wages, which is £132 a week in this country. It is not a lot to live on, if Tory Members think of what they have to live on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Government have been supremely successful in using unemployment, various schemes and availability-for-work testing to shove people's wage expectations down and massively to increase the numbers of people who work for very low wages—40 per cent, of our work force—9.4 million people—in what is the fifteenth richest country in the world. Tory Members boast about prosperity when that high a percentage of our people struggle every week to have enough money to get by, to get shoes for the kids, to have enough food, to get the bus fare. That is the way it is throughout most of my constituency. Running out of money at the end of every week is the normal experience of nearly half the population of this extremely rich country. The Bill will make that situation worse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) for giving way. I do not want to prolong the debate, but she knows that I used to run an employment agency in quite a depressed area in Yorkshire. The difference is amazing. In the real world I used to have staff ringing up to ask for unskilled people to start work immediately. We were offering jobs, often to people who had been unemployed for long periods. We compiled statistics about how many of the people on our books, some of whom had registered in the last week or so, we had to telephone to get one to start work the next day or on the Monday. It would take seven phone calls, although not everyone was always in. If it was for the night shift, it would take 10 phone calls.

The Government are trying to encourage people who may have lost the confidence that they can get a job to go out and work hard to do that—that is their responsibility. It is not the responsibility of the Government constantly to nanny them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not know about the detailed working of the agency of the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce).

Most organisations can be made more efficient.

Like all hon. Members, I have an advice bureau. We represent different kinds of areas, and there tends to be more poverty, unemployment and social problems in areas represented by Labour Members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0106">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
but, like low pay, there are advice bureaux throughout the country. Many of those who look to Labour Members tend not to go to Tory Members. It is not through any fault of those Tory Members that they see much less of a whole section of society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From time to time, people come to my advice bureau and wait in a long queue. I have no appointments system because that would mean that the best organised were always at the front of the queue. I am afraid that people sometimes wait a number of hours to see me at each of the advice bureaux that I do—and I do quite a number. Every few weeks, someone comes in, says something about his or her life and then asks, "Please help me get a job." Often men of 50 cry in front of me. I am embarrassed and it breaks my heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few weeks ago, a smart-looking man brought in a letter. It said: "To whom it may concern: Mr. So-and-so is a skilled draughtsman who has worked for many years, was a very reliable worker and we recommend him to anyone." I said, "That's brilliant. You are obviously a very good worker." He cried—a man older than I am. He said, "I just wanted someone to read it. I used to be really good." He then told me the story of how he was laid off in all the redundancies in the west midlands. He is an older worker, and all the research shows that older workers, even with skills, find great difficulty in getting back into employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He had exhausted his entitlement to unemployment benefit. His wife was still working, in a relatively low paid job. They had brought up a family of four children who are now all over 20, and they were about to break up because of the strain. He was a man of some honour and skills who had lost his job, had no income and felt embarrassed and humiliated. All the research shows that when there is prolonged unemployment, marriages and families break up. That is just one story. I could cite many, and they are true stories.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members say that Labour Members claim to have a monopoly of caring. I do not believe that. I believe that, as human beings, they are capable of caring, but that they do not see the truth of what is going on in our country. It is ugly—1979 was far from perfect but where I come from it is much worse now. The fact that some who live in the Handsworth Wood part of my constituency, which is relatively prosperous, are richer than they have ever been and their houses are worth massively more than they have ever been does not make it good. It makes it worse. It is uglier when the two are side by side, when people with very little see all the glitter, aspire to the clothes and see the advertisements on the television.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This ugliness is part of a deliberate policy of re-ordering our economy to make it more efficient in the way that I described earlier. The price and the pain of it is paid by a large minority of our population who have already been shoved through hoops with the restart system, which forces them into schemes, job clubs, community programmes, employment training and lower wage expectations. The Bill is another step down that road and Conservative Members should be deeply ashamed of themselves. They are ruining fairness and decency in our country.

	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
Another thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said was that the Government are making people into liars. The system is becoming so unfair that people swap stories about how to get round it. It is a corrosive form of humiliation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made this point repeatedly. People swap stories about how to get round the rules because they cannot get work, not because they would rather get round the rules and be on benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all want work and the dignity of work—it is a normal human condition. We talk about our constituents' poverty and perhaps their limited literacy and we know that there has been inequality in education and training opportunities. Many of these people are fine, strong and intelligent. They might not have had the education that some of us have, but they have plenty of talent, motivation and energy. For their own sake and in order to live in society, they want to be in work, they want the income, they want to create something and to be somebody—not just a cabbage scrabbling round benefit offices obtaining a little money to survive. When they swap stories about what happens at a restart interview, it is not because they do not want a job but because they do not want to be further hammered and caught out and have their benefit withdrawn—something that happens to many. When the case is reviewed the benefit is given back, but what happens to them in the meantime? People are forced to cheat because the system is unjust. That is as corrosive to those individuals as the kind of society in which we live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be nice to believe that we approached these Bills honestly, looked at every detail as rational decent human beings and amended end improved Bills. That is impossible. No matter what Tory Members think in their heart of hearts, they will not vote for any change.

It brings the House, and other aspects of our society, into disrepute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give serious consideration to the long-term unemployed, and who will obtain the vacant jobs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not follow the rather imperfect recollections of 1979 of the hon. Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall). When he goes to a job centre and looks at the bald statistics of 800 vacancies, I suspect there are rather more than 800 people unemployed, even in a relatively prosperous area such as Barnet. In most parts of London, the job mismatch of registered vacancies to unemployed is about 1:5 or 1:10, and in some parts of the country it is considerably higher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should think seriously about the misery of the long-term unemployed. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) mentioned the example of a 50-year-old former draftsman. I suspect that she is right to say that that example could be repeated a thousand times over in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0107">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
Birmingham and other parts of the country in which manufacturing industry has been destroyed. When such people apply for all sorts of jobs, employers say, "There must be something funny about him. He has been out of work for so long that he cannot be any good".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government recognised this earlier because a Minister asked on the radio that employers should think of the ability of older women. I agree that older women have great skills that they often cannot use because they cannot obtain jobs. It is ludicrous that a person who is not in a career or an industry, or who does not have a skill that will be needed for the next 20 years, grows nervous by the age of 40. He knows that if his job, his industry or his career ends when he is between the ages of 40 and 50, his chance of obtaining re-employment is slim. In effect, people are retiring at 50 and 55, and the long-term unemployed are in a terrible plight because they have lost income and self-respect and when their children grow up and move away, marital break-up often results because they feel humiliated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are throwing away the abilities and skills of many people on the altar of a free enterprise, competition-orientated market economy. We are throwing away these skills and the abilities of these people, and we are creating the awful misery and humiliation that my hon. Friend experiences when people come to see her. I have similar stories of people coming to me. Sometimes they are quite smartly dressed and decently turned out. They have clearly made a great effort to come to see their Member for Parliament. I recognise the point that they are trying to put forward and then at the end they say, "Do you mind if I ask you something very private?" I say "Of course not", and if there is anybody else in the room, I ask him to leave. I say, "What is it?" and they say, "Is it possible for you to lend me some money?" That happens all the time, every week, either because they cannot make ends meet on the benefit levels—I honestly do not know how people survive on them—or because they have been for a restart interview but have not satisfied, have had the benefit withdrawn and are waiting for a review of their case.

keep a person in the local workhouse. The figures were 10s 6d in the workhouse and 2s 4d from the Bedwellty guardians. That is another memory that should spur us on, a memory of the truth of the past.

The Minister told us that the Morris report of 1929 and the Royal Commission on Unemployment of 1932 were sufficient to go on. It may come as a surprise to him to know that most Members of Parliament still have these two reports in their filing cabinets. There are two points. Yes, we should read those reports and learn from them, but in the passage of 60 years, while Governments have come and gone, unemployment has risen and fallen, and risen and fallen, and there has been no need for this pernicious rule again. We must look at our experience over those 60 years and at what we know about unemployment and re-examine it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will take the judgment of no less distinguished a person than Beveridge himself, who talked about the abolition of the "genuinely seeking work" condition, which finally happened. In a memorable phrase he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The rule has gone and may it never rise again from its dishonoured grave."</p></blockquote>
It has taken 60 years for someone to carry out this exhumation from the sepulchre of 1930. Beveridge's judgment on it, like that of all other commentators, was that it was wasteful and unnecessary.

One person who has made a study of this subject in some detail and talked about the point—made so eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short)—about the experience then and the experience now—and he has said that one cannot put the blame on the men and women involved. If they had admitted that they had been to no more than one firm in a week, they would almost certainly have lost their benefits. I am reminded of the position that many job club applicants are in at the moment. Many good things come from job club applications. Many write to me for a job knowing that they will get a reply at least, because they have to go through this ritual of 10 contacts. Some of the job clubs have been successful, but, by multiplying them, we shall get diminishing returns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this activity is going on, and much of this blizzard of applications, this cacophony of telephone calls, is wasteful, because one of the canards in which the Government believe is that job applications create jobs. Another basic belief—a populist rather than a popular-ism view—is that the unemployed create unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best thing that the Minister could say about the measure would be, not that it is practical, or that it reflects history's lessons, but that it is popular, and fits in with the popular mythology. We have had information on where the popular mythology comes from. The 	<i>Evening Standard</i> was quoted. People receive tabloid information. The soap opera "Bread" is another big influence on people's views. They know that the unemployed can go off to Italy, paid for by the DSS. They saw it at Christmas on television. That is the proof that they have. We have had anecdotal evidence from the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce), but we know, from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0108">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
London labour market survey and elsewhere, that the unemployed generally do not use the kind of private agency that he runs. It may be indicative of this that those whom he quoted all had telephones, which is not the case among the mass of unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That again is anecdotal evidence. We were told on Second Reading that the unemployed are all lazy, and not looking for jobs, and if one asks the man on the Clapham omnibus, that is what he will tell you. We hope, however, that this time we shall have a more scientific test of how many people are unemployed but not really looking for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see that popular view expressed in Conservative party conferences in its ugliest and most brutal form, and there we shall find the reason for the clause. In October of last year, at least one Secretary of State was in trouble, as a result of the job-sharing arrangement between the Secretary of State for Social Security and the Secretary of State for Health. At that conference, before the baying mass of ignorance and malice of those who believe the tabloid information, there were two speeches on 10 October—one by the Secretary of State for Employment, the other by the Secretary of State for Social Security—and both promised this measure. They both said that they would pursue the quarry of the unemployed, who were the cause of the problem. They promised that they would crack down again on the unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 9 December the DSS produced one of its ritual press releases, of which the headline was
	<br><blockquote><p>"No Let-Up on Social Security Fraud",</p></blockquote>
knowing that it was about to mine into that quarry of malice, which had proved politically so useful and productive. It suggested that the problem was not one for which it was responsible. The Government have been in power for 10 years, and if there is a problem in social security, what have they been doing all that time? They promise, and do not present it as a problem, but as if they were coming along on their white chargers with the solution. Again, there was no let-up on social security fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have taken the uninformed popular mythology—people are always inclined to believe the worst of their fellow human beings—and are using it as a weapon to batter the unemployed, and the most vulnerable among them, the elderly and those with no expectation of a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke of the sensitivity with which the measure has been introduced and is being used. Among the questionnaires issued to claimants under the fourth statutory condition in the 1920s was a proviso for those responsible for them:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Having regard to state of employment locally, what chance has an 	<i>average</i> worker of obtaining work of the kind(s) claimant is seeking? (Say, excellent, good, fair, poor, with comments as necessary.)"</p></blockquote>
It was not, then, entirely the brute instrument that perhaps we think. Even in those circumstances, however, it turned out to work in an unfair way. I have a telling example from my own area. Those concerned know that it will be not an objective but a subjective judgment, and that civil servants may well allow their judgment to work on one side. Some will be generous and humanitarian, some not. Even
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
under those rules, which were not entirely harsh, although they were interpreted to be, the attitude of Mr. William Jones, chairman of the court of referees for Bargoed in the Rhymney valley, could hardly be bettered. It will still be possible for people to adopt a similar attitude. He said that his purpose was to tell the unemployed person that he was not expected merely to stay at home. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We lead him to believe that staying at home doing nothing is not going to continue his benefit. We do not ask him where he has been to satisfy ourselves that he has been substantial distances, but for the purpose of satisfying ourselves that he has been out of the house. We do not impose it as a condition. It is not a condition, but more to convey to his mind that sitting at home is not to be tolerated… We know it to be useless for the men to go over the hill,"—</p></blockquote>
the old ritual; the pilgrimage that is so well remembered in south Wales and elsewhere—
	<br><blockquote><p>"'We have our own unemployed here … It is no use you going here and there because you cannot get work';"—</p></blockquote>
this is the telling phrase—
	<br><blockquote><p>"we must lead them to believe that they must make some effort to keep themselves in the way of looking for work."</p></blockquote>
They interpreted that rule, knowing it to be harsh, cruel and vindictive, to satisfy society's belief that unemployed people need to be punished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. William.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There might have been an excuse in the minds of those who introduced the law in the 1920s. It is fascinating to read how they saw it working. There is clearly a parallel between what the Minister said and the thinking of Shaw and Margaret Bondfield. They thought that introducing the genuinely seeking work clause was a reasonable price and little more than a nuisance. Its effect would be slight, as we are being told now for those who were genuinely unemployed. The party in power at the time was concerned as much as any other party, as we have heard this morning, to make sure that those who were cheating the system should not get away with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The function of the safeguards was to demonstrate what they believed to be self-evident, that the great majority of the unemployed were unemployed through no fault of their own. However, Margaret Bondfield some years later, looking back at the experience with the knowledge of the years that had passed, said in her autobiography
	<br><blockquote><p>"the psychological difficulty of proving it"—</p></blockquote>
that people were genuinely seeking work—
	<br><blockquote><p>"had not occurred to us."</p></blockquote>
The damage that was done had not been foreseen. There is some excuse for saying that when one is introducing legislation for the first time. She also said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Ministry officials saw no cause for concern about the fairness of the existing conditions".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0109">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
Ministers are being told now, or perhaps they are leading the movement to toss the pound of flesh to the howling mob at the Tory party conference. Other advice may be coming through now. Margaret Bondfield said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Ministry officials saw no cause for concern about the fairness of the existing conditions and assured the Ministers that they were 'in general, applied with reasonable discretion.' "</p></blockquote>
That turned out to be a falsehood. It did not occur that way. There it is very much a London-driven idea, and the justification for it will be put forward by the London labour market survey, which we shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
study in considerable detail. When it is proposed in many parts of the country where there are 200 vacancies for 3,000 unemployed, it becomes a nonsense.
