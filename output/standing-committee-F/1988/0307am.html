	<div class='page-header'><h1>Social Security Bill</h1></div>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 19</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EQUAL TREATMENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first hon. Member to speak, I shall say to the Committee that although the weather is not up to its usual standard, I have every confidence that the debates during the remainder of the Committee stage will be invigorating and exciting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Marion Roe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Broxbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the provisions in clause 19 will be welcomed by millions of working women throughout the country, for it brings to an end discrimination in employment-related benefit schemes. Benefit schemes that discriminate against women as a result of their family or marital status are not only unfair to women, but represent an obstacle to the smooth operation of the labour market. At a time when the number of young people in the labour market is contracting and when employers will increasingly have to consider employing older people, especially married women, our economy simply cannot afford to place obstacles in the way of the employment of women. All such barriers are certainly a disincentive to women to seek work and an impediment to the creation of prosperity and jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am delighted that the clause will ensure that women who take maternity leave will not lose benefit entitlement as a result. Many women who take maternity leave are immensely irked to discover that their period of absence is treated, for the purposes of calculating pensions, as if they had taken a long holiday. I assure the Committee that bearing and rearing children is certainly not a long holiday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, while we are considering pensions and the equality of treatment between men and women, there arises the question of the equalisation of the pension age in the state scheme. Those of us who believe in giving women a fair deal in matters of employment and social security legislation recognise that the argument can, of course, work both ways. Women should understand that the principle of equality may require them to retire later than at present rather than men retiring earlier. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will reassure the Committee that the Government proposals on the matter will be carefully worked through. The Government should not be rushed into a crucial decision that will affect the lives of generations of workers and pensioners. I think that the Government have already accepted the principle of equalisation, but the implementation of that principle is less than straightforward. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to reply to that point, because I am sure that it affects
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>952</span>
many people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe) for making that point. I had intended to make it under later amendments tabled by the Government. We welcome any further moves towards equal treatment in pension schemes. I, too, would be interested to know from the Minister what are the Government's long-term intentions with regard to the equalisation of pension ages. I know that they have made various remarks about them. I am also aware that the National Association of Pension Funds has said how sorry it is that the Government have not taken the opportunity to take steps in that direction. I am not sure whether it is proposing that the equalisation age should be at 65—or how widely such a proposal would be welcomed—or whether it is simply saying that that way, the equalisation would not cost anything, which it realises would recommend itself to the Government. It would be helpful if the Minister would give us some outline of the Government's thinking on a timetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Marshall 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hendon, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How do our pension ages compare with those of our European partners? How many other European countries give pensions to women at the age of 60?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We begin on a note of general agreement, although some might feel able to go further than others, certainly further than I shall now. I welcome the tenor of the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe) and the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett). The Bill continues the process of removing those inequalities and barriers to women in work that can reasonably be removed by legislation. I can confirm that we are committed to the principle of an equal retirement pension age. Alas, I cannot now say what we shall commit ourselves to, nor when we will be able to announce it. These are complex matters. The state retirement pension age has an impact in many ways on occupational pension schemes and it would be wrong to come to a decision without taking those fully into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we must take into account the plans that individuals make. Since 1940, the retirement pension age for women has been 60, five years younger than the male retirement pension age. People have planned, if not their careers, certainly their last few years in work, in the expectation of their pension being paid from a particular point. To make sweeping change without taking all those matters into account would also be wrong. Thirdly, we are constrained by the fact that we belong to the EC. There have been a number of directives on equal treatment and another, which is currently in draft, is intended to complete the exercise of providing for equal treatment in these areas. A great deal of discussion and debate between ourselves, the other member states and the Commission is needed to make sure that that directive is appropriate and workable and that it produces results that are fair to both men and women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I reiterate that we are committed to this principle. I also take what my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0549">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>953</span>
Broxbourne said about not rushing: we need to get it right. However, we need to move with sensible speed because delaying a decision on these matters produces uncertainty and creates difficulties for outside organisations. This is a matter to which the Government must give close attention. We are doing that now, but I cannot say when our discussions will be completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the Minister's remark that the Government must move speedily but that they do not know when they will get there. I am not sure that one age for men and women is the right solution. They should be treated equally, but people's retirement plans depend on factors such as their health and whether they do heavy manual work, and we should aim more for a flexible decade of retirement so that people can choose when they retire. That is better than having one age at which we must all retire. I hope that the Government is thinking along those lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is quite right. That is one of the many complexities. As she knows, the Government showed great interest in the idea of a decade of retirement some short while ago. I agree that there is much in that idea, although there may have to be flexibility around a particular reference point. Questions like this make the exercise complex and we need to deal with them as quickly as possible. I wish that I could be more precise, but I cannot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is one of timing, which is of the essence in the Bill. Clause 19 states:
	<br><q><p>"Schedule 3 to this Act shall have effect for the purpose of implementing the directive of the Council of the European Communities",</p></q>
but schedule 3 will not, at this stage, implement fully the requirements of the EEC directive. Amending legislation will be needed before 1993. If I am right in assuming that, the Government will have to get their act together quite quickly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that point relates to the state retirement pension age, which is what we are discussing. It is the subject of the draft directive which is not yet in force, but is under negotiation. The additional dimension of Europe is an aid to speed, but it also means that we cannot fix the way ahead without knowing what the European directive will finally require of us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, South (Mr. Marshall) asked about the retirement age in Europe. I cannot tell him precisely what each country does, but the majority of countries within the European Community have or are moving towards a joint retirement age of 65.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>EMPLOYMENT-RELATED SCHEMES FOR PENSIONS OR OTHER BENEFITS: EQUAL TREATMENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 300, in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>954</span>
page 35, line 3, after second "sex" insert—
	<br><q><p>"and persons who have unmarried partners shall not, on the basis of being unmarried, be treated less favourably than persons who are married".</p></q>
The amendment deals with marital status, and under it, people would not be treated differently according to whether or not they are legally married.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move the amendment partly to probe the Government's intentions. Whatever our views, more and more people are living together before marriage, or are living together for a long time and having children without getting married. The problems for the future could be significant. Under many existing insurance schemes, there is some provision for pension cover for an unmarried dependant, but it is usually considerably lower than if the couple were married.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From memory, I think that as many as 25 per cent of couples live together unmarried, and a considerable proportion of them have children. Certainly the figure is increasing remarkably. If we do not consider this, and make provisions for it, more and more dependants will be left with no cover, although the payments made by the working partner might be just as high as if the couple were legally married. If a male breadwinner dies in an accident and leaves behind a wife and small children, they are not properly protected at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government have considered the matter of changing social patterns and have thought about regulating it. If the Minister is not willing to accept the amendment, will he tell us what thought and provision the Government have given to the growing number of couples with dependent children who have not chosen to be formally married?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before dealing with that point, I shall say a few words on the general principles that lie behind the Government's attitude to statutory requirements on occupational pension schemes as it relates to this amendment and a number of other that we shall be debating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, the Government do not feel that it is right to lay down requirements on schemes, as they are set up voluntarily by employers. It is for them to consult with their employees and determine what should be in the scheme, the rules, and who is eligible to join the scheme. Therefore, in drawing up the rules of the scheme, the employer will no doubt take account of the needs of the employees, his problems in recruiting, retaining and rewarding staff, and the cost to the company of implementing the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many schemes the employers have an obligation to make up any deficit in the scheme's funds where the liabilities exceed its assets. Therefore, we must be careful before imposing financial burdens that might cause an employer to wind up a scheme, or to decide that it cannot be supported any more, because it has become different to the scheme that he set up. That might cause others to think twice before starting a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of Government has been to allow schemes to take the form that the employer and employees determine. However, in some matters they have felt it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0550">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>955</span>
necessary to apply certain statutory requirements, the most obvious being tax approval. Secondly, rules have been laid down for contracting out of SERPs. Thirdly, we have laid down rules for the rights and protection of early leavers. The schedule introduces a fourth statutory involvement, concerning equal treatment. We require schemes to provide widowers' pensions as well as widows' pensions as a condition of contracting out. In schedule 4 we shall discuss, for the first time, the extension of preservation requirements to widows' pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have brought equal treatment into the statutory obligations. Nevertheless, in introducing the new provision, we need to bear in mind the voluntary nature of the scheme. To add to the cost of a scheme—especially an open-ended one—could have catastrophic results for schemes that are not funded to take on the extra responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 300 would require schemes to treat persons who have unmarried partners no less favourably than married persons. Paragraph (2) already provides that
	<br><q><p>"the principle of equal treatment"</p></q>
applies in relation to a member's dependants as it does to members. However, the unmarried partner might not be a dependant, so whether he or she is covered depends on the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister said seems to be important.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that if the relationship is one of dependency, there is a requirement for equal treatment, whether or not the couple are married.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I am saying. However we cannot accept the amendment. To require the scheme to make pension provision for an unmarried partner who is not a dependant is not right. However, if in a scheme an unmarried dependant had the right to the benefit from contributions on the death of his or her partner, that must apply equally to either sex. Therefore, the law goes further than perhaps the hon. Lady expected, although it does not go as far as she perhaps wished. However, it covers dependency where the pension is particularly needed. Exactly where the line is drawn between dependency and non-dependency will be clear in most cases but might sometimes be difficult to distinguish. However, the law requires that where a scheme provides for unmarried dependants, this should be done irrespective of sex.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say a little more about how dependency is tested and who decides whether someone is dependent? Clearly, people may be dependent or not according to the phase of their lives. I foresee masses of contested cases on the basis of what the Minister says. How will they be decided?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the rules of the scheme will determine that. Secondly, dependency will usually be clear but some cases will have to be decided by law, in terms
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>956</span>
of the rules laid down by the scheme. Those rules will differ from scheme to scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must examine this closely to ensure that the arrangements are fair and sensibly imposed, in case the Government need to make statutory provision. I cannot accept the amendment, but the hon. Lady has raised an important point and I should like to give its implications more thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That reply was more helpful than I expected. I expected to see the knee-jerk Tory prejudice against couples who are not legally married.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend want me to intervene while she regains her balance?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for my hon. Friend's offer, but I did not lose my balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister is thinking seriously about this. Despite the view that some members of the Committee may take of couples who live together unmarried it is the practice of an ever-growing proportion of the population. If benefits and pensions provisions do not take it into account, gaping holes will be left, causing hardship to individuals and potential expense to the state. If the breadwinner in any couple is making contributions towards a pension scheme and his partner is not protected, something is actuarially wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Minister says that if the relationship is one of dependency, the Bill requires that there should be no inequality of treatment if two people are not formally married. Can we not take the final step? What difference would it make and how much would it cost? Why were the Government willing to go that far and no further? It is odd that the law will protect people who are not married in different phases of their lives, but when their children grow up, start to work and are no longer dependent, their pension entitlement suddenly evaporates. If they then become older and frailer and cannot work they will once again be entitled to pension rights. That seems a funny way to go about things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it help if the Minister reminded the Committee of the income support rules for common law marriages? Children are not the only criterion; whether it is a common household must also be taken into account. In a common household case, rights to benefit would continue irrespective of the age and dependency of the children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. To qualify for state benefit, a partner must not be better off by not being legally married. It is a negative provision which says that the couple must not gain by cohabiting but being unmarried. If they gain, their benefits will be knocked back to put them in the same position as a married couple. Yet no provision says that couples who are not married are as entitled to pension rights in private schemes as married people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None the less, I am pleased that the Bill covers partnerships where there is dependency. As the Minis-

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>957</span>
ter said that the Government want to give further thought to the matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spring to my feet to speak for a few seconds about the amendment and to urge my hon. Friend the Minister to be cautious. If the amendment were accepted, it would work against deserted wives. Is a woman who has been married for 30 or 40 years and has been deserted by her husband less entitled to share in a pension scheme than a woman who is a "partner" of that man and may have lived with him for only six months? That is a classic dilemma. A woman who chooses to live with a married man is not necessarily his only dependant. Someone else may have far greater claim to pension rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. As the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) intervened after the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short) sought leave to withdraw the amendment, I cannot now seek the Committee's permission to withdraw the amendment. The amendment will have to be negatived.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. Am I right in thinking that nobody has to vote on the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 301, in page 35, line 11, leave out "considerably".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This comes in a special category of amendments—it is a combination of a probing and a nit-picking amendment. We are probing the Government as to why paragraph 2(3) of the schedule says:
	<br><q><p>"Where any provision of the scheme imposes on both male and female members a requirement… which is such that the proportion of persons of the one sex ('the sex affected') who can comply with it is considerably smaller than the proportion of persons of the other sex who can do so, and …which is not justifiable irrespective of the sex of the members, … that … shall be regarded as less favourable treatment".</p></q>
Why did the Government qualify the paragraph with the word, "considerably"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is slightly nit-picking. You, Mr. Winterton, took exception to an earlier amendment of ours that used the word "exceptionally", on the grounds that that was a vague word. Our adviser ingeniously produced an alternative form of words that was acceptable to the Chair. If "exceptionally" is vague, "considerably" cannot be said to be a definite term. The word "exceptionally" was used in social security legislation; I wonder whether the Minister knows of any precedents for using "considerably". Is there any way to quantify it? The word might be unnecessary because paragraph 2(3) applies only to requirements or conditions which are not justifiable irrespective of the sex of members. A condition that fails that test and in practice discriminates between the sexes to even a small extent ought to be regarded as constituting unequal treatment. As it seems that the use of the word "considerably" will make the test more

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must agree with the hon. Member for Derby, South. I have no personal objection to the word "exceptionally", but it is entirely your decision, Mr. Winterton, whether it appears on the Amendment Paper. However, I have a certain fondness for the word "considerably", which I found lurking on the first page of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Section 1 of that Act states:
	<br><q><p>"A person discriminates against a women in any circumstances relevant for the purposes of any provision of this Act if …he applies to her a requirement or condition which he applies or would apply equally to a man but—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>which is such that the proportion of women who can comply with it is considerably smaller than the proportion of men who can comply with it."</p></q>
We thought that whoever was responsible for that Act got a number of things right, including the use of that word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The person responsible for that phrasing in the Act was Anthony Lester, who was a special adviser to the Home Secretary at that time and is now a QCI think.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is, and he is a very fine lawyer. If he judged that the word was a useful distinguishing legal term, it must have its merits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps they will be published one day, but not in the records of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to be on all fours with the directive. At times, the EC draws up its requirements somewhat more broadly than we would in our own legislation. Without the word "considerably" if there were one fewer or one more woman in a particular group, the law would act differently towards them—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would be considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. It should be more than that because a majority or minority of one could change overnight. This makes it clear that there has to be a distinct and considerable difference. It must be plain to the eye that more women or more men fall into that category. Therefore, we thought it wise to reproduce the word used in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. I hope that I have said enough to convince the hon. Lady that the word "considerably" is not used to ensure that the offence against the Act has to be so gross that it is stretched beyond its meaning in 1975. It should have the same meaning as the authors of that Act intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Essentially, the purpose of the amendments is to probe the legislation in detail, as the Government may not have thought through the practical implications of ending discrimination, either in the wording of the Bill or the timing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was reported that in phasing out sex discrimination in company pensions, women could lose out in the end. Even if the Government are reluctant to lower men's retirement age to 60 because of the cost in social security payments, it seems that that measure will be phased in gradually over a period of years. Pensions rise along with prices, rather than with earnings, so that as the economy improves, pensions will lower as a proportion of earnings. It is suggested that the situation could alter very soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the employment appeals tribunal rules that a man who retires at 60 should get a pension equal to a woman's at the same age, the Government might find that the Bill is effectively gazumped. In other words, the case law will move ahead of the Bill and the Government's provisions to bring our law into line with the EEC directives. The current Clarke v Cray will come before the tribunal in a matter of months and may result in company pension schemes having to introduce equal pensions for equal work. If that happens, the Social Security Bill, which will be on Report or Third Reading, will be caught short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal specifically with the exemption arrangements for individuals from equal treatment requirements. Those arrangements are of concern to bodies such as the Association of British Insurers. What does the Minister imagine that the legislation will mean in practice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 302 deals with the word "value". Sub-paragraph (4)(b) will enable employers to make higher contributions to money purchase schemes for women than for men so as to provide equal pension rates, taking into account that on average, women live longer than men, and their pensionable age is lower than men's. If that is the provision's intention, it would be achieved by allowing differences in contributions for the purpose of removing differences in the amount of money benefits, but the provision refers to the "amount or value" of money purchase benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a money purchase scheme, different contribution ' rates are bound to produce differences in the value of the benefits. It is difficult to see how any such differences can be removed or limited. What is meant by "value" in this context? Why should different contri
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>960</span>
bution rates be required to produce benefits of equal value in a money purchase scheme? Those are the direct questions posed by probing amendment No. 302.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 305 deals with exemptions where schemes have been specially arranged for an individual member. In schedule 3, sub-paragraph 2(4)(f) exempts from equal treatment
	<br><q><p>"any provisions of a scheme to the extent that they have been specially arranged for the benefit of one particular member of the scheme".</p></q>
In other words, it allows discrimination on the basis of sex to the extent that benefits will be specially arranged for individual members. That does not seem reasonable if the special benefits cannot be justified on grounds other than sex. This is either discrimination on the basis of sex, or it is not. There should be other reasons for exempting individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many small occupational pension schemes and schemes for executives and directors are set up on the basis that the scale of benefits is specially arranged for each individual at the employer's discretion. However, the present provision will be no constraint whatever on systematic sex discrimination in such cases. Amendment No. 305 would delete the sub-paragraph, although it would not prevent employers from making special arrangements for individual members of the scheme, providing that—crucially—those arrangements were not made on the basis of sex discrimination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 311 makes another deletion. Its purpose is to challenge the category of exempt schemes. The equal treatment requirements of schedule 3 do not apply as they stand to three categories of exempt scheme, set out in paragraph (7)(b). The most important is:
	<br><q><p>"(i) any personal scheme for employed earners to which the employer does not contribute".</p></q>
That means that most so-called personal pension schemes will be exempt from equal treatment, since the employer will not normally contribute to them. He will simply pay the full employer's national insurance contribution for the employee, part of which will obviously be passed on to the personal scheme by the Department of Social Security. The employers themselves will contribute directly to the scheme only where contributions above the minimum level are paid. Where that happens, the scheme will not then be an exempt scheme. In other words, it will still be allowed to discriminate on the grounds of sex in the amount or value of the benefits. There seems no good reasons for exempting personal pension schemes from these requirements. If anything, members of such schemes need more protection, not less. Our amendment would provide that they would in principle be subject to the equal treatment provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 312 reminds us of a derisory concept in the context of equal treatment—the concept of the "key man" contract. Amendment No. 312 would add to the exemption schemes such contracts. There are insurance contracts known as "key man" policies, which provide a financial benefit to the employer on the death or disability of a crucial member of staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a concept builds in a complete denial of equal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0553">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>961</span>
treatment that would be unacceptable in this day and age. It would be idiotic to support such schemes without exemptions that allow discrimination on the basis of the "key man" contract. The amendment would add such contracts to the definition in the schedule of exempt schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot have it both ways. Either we have attempts to deal with equal treatment which mean what they say, so that men and women are treated equally, or we do not. We cannot have a schedule in a Bill that claims to provide that while not doing so. The Government may say that they have difficulties, that they have to deal with the EEC directive, and that amended regulations will be introduced later. However, if the intention is to introduce equal treatment in principle, it makes a nonsense of it to allow substantial loopholes that allow people to opt out of that equal treatment. We should not leave in the Bill categories open to discrimination on the basis of sex.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are probing amendments which we have tabled because we want the loopholes to be closed, so that the Government do not seem to be facing both ways at the same time—that is, claiming in principle to accept equal treatment but in practice leaving a rather less than watertight sieve for the policy details.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 302 would require money purchase occupational pension schemes to take no account of women's longer life expectancy in determining the rate of annuity payable. Schemes may at present take account of the fact that the same total "pot" which has accrued in respect of any individual—a man or woman—has to be spread on average over a longer period for a woman than for a man because of the longer life expectancy of women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have considerable sympathy with the general thinking behind the amendment. Indeed, in the Social Security Act 1986, the Government introduced a requirement that the pension that derived from protected rights—the opting out of the state earnings-related pension scheme—should be calcualted without regard to the sex of the individual. The protected rights are either all the rights of the scheme—in which case the amendment is unnecessary—or, more usually, the minimum contributions or payments required as a condition for contracting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, where a money purchase pension scheme is contracted out, all or part of the pension rights are, as a result of the legislation which we introduced and which came into effect last year, provided on a unisex basis. That is what the hon. Gentleman for Leeds, West Mr. Battle) wants. The amendment would affect only those pensions derived from other than protected rights. It applies over and above the basic requirements of contracting out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have expressed my sympathy and understanding of the general thrust of what the hon. Gentleman has said, and reminded the Committee that the Government have introduced a unisex basis for contracting out. However, I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment for two reasons. Firstly, as I explained in our previous discussion on amendment No. 300, we
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>962</span>
believe that in general, schemes are set up voluntarily and should decide themselves what benefits they provide and on what basis they are calculated. Secondly, when we introduced contracted-out money purchase arrangements and appropriate personal pensions, we adopted a "level playing fields" approach, not favouring occupational schemes against personal pensions and vice versa. To adopt the amendment proposed by the hon. Member for Leeds, West would leave occupational schemes at a disadvantage in comparison with personal pensions. Personal pension schemes would continue to be able to calculate the non-protected rights pension entitlement on the basis of the circumstances of each individual, which would be more advantageous to men than the requirement on money purchase schemes to calculate the non-protected rights pensions on a unisex average.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, in principle, we accept that it is for the scheme itself to decide how to calculate the rate of benefit in money purchase annuities except where they are a SERPS replacement. As we wish to encourage the development of occupational schemes and the improvement of the benefits that they provide, I regret that sympathetic though I am to the general drift of the amendment, and although I understand why the hon. Member for Leeds, West made the points that he made, I am unable to accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened carefully to the Minister. Am I right in thinking that if he were to accept amendment No. 311, which does not make personal pensions exempt and makes them give the same protection, his point would be taken care of?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because that would mean less flexibility and less choice to enable the non-contracting-out part of personal pension schemes to provide a pension scheme that was appropriate to the individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reflect on that, but 1 do not believe that the two points are on all fours with one another.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a slightly different point, but one relevant to the word "unisex", does the provision that dependants are covered refer to dependants of the same sex?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give the hon. Lady an exact and refined answer on how dependency is determined. Obviously, the Government will provide a definition in the legislation for the state system. As that will be defined in many pension schemes more or less completely, one will have to ask separate questions about each scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister made clear as few
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0554">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>963</span>
moments ago, the Bill provides that there cannot be unequal treatment of people in a relationship where there is dependency, on the basis of whether or not they are legally married. Does the provision refer just to cohabiting couples, or does the protection extend beyond cohabiting couples to potentially gay couples or people without a sexual relationship—such as a brother and sister—where there is dependency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I should like to give the hon. Lady as exact an answer as possible, I shall write to her and to Committee members. It is a complex matter, and I do not want to mislead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak now about amendment No. 305. Individual arrangements are specifically excluded from the directive. The derogations in the directive include individual arrangements which are subject to one specific contract between an occupational scheme and a member, schemes which have only one member and, in the case of salaried workers, individual contracts to which the employer is not a party. Such arrangements are made to meet a particular need in a particular set of circumstances and to provide a particular individual with benefits on a personal basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Providers such as insurance companies, banks, building societies and friendly societies set up standard packages on which to base personal benefit contracts and arrangements both for administrative convenience and to enable an individual more easily to compare what each provider offers. None the less, the contract between the individual and the provider is a personal and individual one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a scheme or contract relates to one, and only one, individual, that individual may be compared only with a hypothetical person. There is no one else in the scheme with whom the individual may be compared. During our consultation exercise we made it clear that the provisions in the Bill would not cover provisions specifically arranged for particular individuals, so we do not consider it appropriate to extend the requirements to cover them. Therefore I am afraid that I cannot accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 311 would require any personal scheme personally arranged and paid for by an individual, without any contribution from the employer, to be subject to the principle of equal treatment. As I have said, the EC directive, the terms of which we seek to implement in the Bill, specifically excludes individual arrangements. Such arrangements are made to meet particular needs in particular circumstances, with benefits provided on a personal basis. Although scheme providers set up standard packages when providing personal benefits, for both administrative convenience and ease of comparison for individuals the contract between the individual and the provider is a personal one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a scheme or contract relates to only one individual, there cannot be a question of equality of treatment other than a hypothetical one. For that reasons, I cannot accept amendment No. 311.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 312 would add to the list of schemes exempted from those to which the schedule applies
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>964</span>
	<br><q><p>"any contract of insurance which is made by and for the benefit of an employer".</p></q>
The amendment would apply to arrangements that employers make with insurance companies to compensate them for the absence through ill health or following the death of certain "key workers".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Key man" is what it says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is not needed because the scope of the directive and of the Bill does not cover such contracts. It does not apply to an employer as beneficiary. The aim of the directive is to implement the principle of equal treatment in "occupational social security schemes" defined in article 2 as those whose sole purpose is to provide workers—whether employees or self-employed—and members of their family with benefits intended to supplement the benefits provided by statutory social security schemes or to replace them. Insurance for key workers does neither.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is unnecessary as it is intended to exclude something that the Bill does not cover. The Bill should be silent on this matter. It should be left to the employers to judge what their own interests are in the matter. In so far as employers make that decision and feel that it is in their interests to insure some of their employees, it should be left to their own unfettered choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not seem to have got any further. The Minister has simply reiterated that the Government agree in principle but he is prepared to allow the opt-out clauses to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notion of the level playing field was introduced by the Irish EC commissioner, and it has slipped into the language of our Treasury Ministers. I have not yet encountered the perfect pitch on which to play. Usually there are some inequalities in the pitch, to say the least. The Under-Secretary has left it in that condition. I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment if he said something about the case that is going before employment appeals tribunal in the next few months, which could result in company pension schemes having to introduce equal pensions for equal work. I know that this question is hypothetical because the case has not yet been heard, but if that happens, will the amending legislation to enable us to comply with the EC directive be brought forward sooner rather than later?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am aware of the case to which the hon. Gentleman refers.

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 170, in page 35, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>"(cc) any permitted age-related differences;".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Government amendment No. 171.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are important amendments and quite a number of things flow from them. I hope that I will have the Committee's understanding if I take a few minutes to point out what the amendments do and what flows from them. They fulfil an undertaking, which we gave when the Bill was introduced, that we would table an amendment that would permit occupational schemes to continue to put retirement pensions into payment at different ages for men and women. Schemes will still be able beyond 1993 to start paying pensions to women at 60 and to men at 65, or at other combinations of ages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments take advantage of the exeption to the principle of equal treatment permitted by article 9(a) of the EC directive that the schedule implements. That article permits member states to defer the compulsory application of the principle of equal treatment with regard to
	<br><q><p>"determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age or Retirement Pensions, and the possible implications for other benefits:</p></q>
	<br><q><p>—either until the date on which such equality is achieved in statutory schemes,</p></q>
	<br><q><p>—or, at the latest, until such equality is required by a directive."</p></q>
Recent caselaw of the European Court of Justice has led us to conclude that the exception is strictly drawn and must be narrowly applied. We do not consider that it would be in anyone's interest for the Bill to implement the exception in terms which the European Court would be likely subsequently to hold to be beyond what is permitted by the directive. This would require amending legislation and schemes, having amended their rules, could be required to do so a second time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the exception permit? First, it permits differences in pension age
	<br><q><p>"for the purposes of granting old-age or Retirement Pensions".</p></q>
This means that schemes may provide for different ages at which pensions come into payment to men and to women. Secondly, it permits
	<br><q><p>"the possible implications for other benefits"—</p></q>
that is benefits to which the directive and schedule 3 apply—
	<br><q><p>"of differences in pension age for retirement benefits".</p></q>
Therefore, if a scheme member receives, for example, benefits under the scheme for ill health and those benefits are reduced or replaced from pension age by a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>966</span>
retirement pension, the ill health benefits may reduce or cease at for instance, 65 for men or 60 for women if those are the ages at which the scheme retirement pension becomes payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does the exception not permit? Because the exception applies for the purposes only of granting pensions, it does not extend to other areas, even though the particular issue is directly linked to the age at which pensions come into payment. First, it does not apply to the right to be, or become, a member of a scheme. Schemes will be unable to fix a different maximum age of entry to the scheme, such as 55 for women and 60 for men, notwithstanding that that age is expressed as a specified number of years before pension age. Nor will they be able to prevent women from continuing to be in pensionable service beyond the scheme's normal pension age for women, if men who are under their normal pension age may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the exception does not apply to differences in the maximum age at which a member is entitled to pay contributions to the scheme, nor to any consequential liability upon employers to contribute for the same period. If men are entitled to pay contributions, and the scheme rules require employers to contribute, until 65, women who continue working will also be entitled to pay contributions until 65, with a consequent liability on employers, even though, if they had retired from the employment, they would have been entitled to draw a pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, schemes which put pensions into payment to men and women at the same age must generally calculate the rates of benefit on the same basis. There is an exception in paragraph 2(4) (b) of the schedule in respect of any difference in the amount of money purchase benefits on actuarial grounds—because women on average live longer the same value of pension has to be spread out over a longer period and may therefore be lower. Nevertheless, as a condition of contracting out of SERPS, schemes will still have to disregard the sex of the member in calculating annuities derving from protected rights. Paragraphs 2(4) and 2(8) also except differences resulting from the member's choice, as to the date on which the pension is to commence. If a scheme normally pays pensions to men at 65 and women at 60, but a man chooses to take early retirement and draw his pension from 60, the scheme may actuarially reduce his pension to a rate lower than would be payable to a woman at the same age. That does not apply, however, if the man is compulsorily retired early. In such cases, the scheme must pay the same pension as would be payable to a woman at the same age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other impact that the narrow application of the derogation will have on schemes will be in relation to the limited number of "integrated schemes" that pay pensions to men below 65 and also make a deduction from a woman's pension, or enhance a man's pension, as calculated under scheme rules to take account of the fact that the state retirement pension is payable to women but not to men between 60 and 65. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Slough (Mr. Watts) raised this issue during the speech of my right hon. Friend and Secretary of State in relation to the Mars pension scheme. I am sorry to disappoint those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0556">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>967</span>
who provide such integrated schemes, but a scheme that pays a lower pension to a woman between her 60th and 65th birthdays, albeit by reason of the difference in age of entitlement to state retirement pension, would be in breach of the requirements of the directive, and hence of the Bill.

However, the Bill mirrors the directive in not applying to rights that accrue during any period before 1 January 1993 when it comes into effect. Integrated schemes will continue beyond 1993 to be able to make deductions to take account of state retirement pension from a woman's pension rights which accrued before that date, even where there is no equivalent deduction from a man's pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments do not meet the full requirements of the directive with regard to pension age. The present statutory conditions for contracting out of the state earnings-related pension scheme are not fully covered by the exception permitted in respect of pension age. Where pensions provided under scheme rules would otherwise be less than the guaranteed minimum pension required as a condition of contracting out, a scheme is statutorily required to raise the pension to the guaranteed minimum pension level from the state pensionable age of 65 for men and 60 for women. Thus where a man and a woman both retire at 60 with what would otherwise be the same rate of pension from the scheme, the woman's pension must be increased from age 60 to the guaranteed minimum pension rate, but there is no similar increase for the man until 65. Similar difficulties arise in contracted-out money purchase schemes, which must not pay the amount of pension that derives from protected rights before pensionable age, even though they may pay pensions deriving from non-protected rights from an earlier common pension age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To comply, therefore, with the requirements of the directive, it will be necessary to amend certain conditions for contracting-out of SERPS. These are complex issues, which cannot be resolved in time for later stages of the Bill. We intend to introduce another Bill in time to meet the operative date of 1 January 1993.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I shall say a few words about the principle of adopting the pension age derogation. The derogation is permitted by the directive only until the achievement of equal treatment in respect of pension age in the state scheme, or until a further EC directive requires equal treatment in this area. We have received representations suggesting that we should permit no pension age exception for occupational schemes—and even that the Bill should be the instrument for introducing equal treatment as regards the pension age for men and women in the state scheme. It is not right to require occupational schemes to adopt a common pension age while the state continues to differentiate. To amend occupational or state pension age provisions raises a number of complex questions, some of which were discussed earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, we believe that these extremely important questions should be considered further, but we shall introduce legislation in due course to revise the conditions for contracting out of SERPS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I made some remarks about the amendment when the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe) spoke on clause 19 stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we should place a little more fully on the record the extent of the worry that is being expressed throughout the pensions industry. As the Minister said, the derogation that the Government are proposing is permitted until other directives are made. There is now a widespread feeling that the position may change soon, if only because of the haste to which my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) and the Minister referred. Even if nothing else changes, a further equal treatment directive will probably emerge in the near future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its "Employment Affairs" report, the CBI said:
	<br><q><p>"It is quite clear that action to equalise pension ages is inevitable and increasingly urgent".</p></q>
The CBI stressed the necessity of formulating long-term plans in the near future. It argued for the introduction of the flexible retirement decade of the kind suggested by the then Minister, the right hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Fowler), in 1985. That was four years ago and, although I recognise that the Government have other things on their minds, they are lowering the general standard of prevention provision in the meantime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the CBI pointed out, if there is to be further movement on this issue—as we believe there will be—the more thought that is given to how it will be done, the better. We should not simply say that it may happen some day and we shall think about it then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Pension Funds said that the decision not to include in the Bill the proposals for pensionable age and occupational schemes caused the association
	<br><q><p>"great concern. Disappointment was expressed by many commentators over the Government's decision to defer equalisation of … pension ages".</p></q>
Clearly, there is growing anxiety that sweeping and substantial changes will be made, without the necessary planning and consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether I misheard the Minister and I should like to get the record clear. The Minister said that in integrated schemes the pension of a woman between 60 and 65 would be reduced because she received a state pension, but the pension of a man would not be reduced because he would not receive a state pension until the age of 65. I understand that that position could not continue beyond 1993, although it can continue until then in respect of rights accruing up to 1993. Did the Minister say that such schemes can continue after 1993?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Up to 1993, pensions that accrue on the existing basis will be perfectly legitimate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That clarifies the position and is how I understood it but the Minister left me less than clear.

The Minister said that a later Bill is likely to be needed because of the conditions for the contracting out of SERPS. Nevertheless, there will be probably be another major pensions Bill soon, so it is even more important that the Government consider the sort of changes that will be made at that stage to pension aid.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point, concerning compliance dates, was made by the National Association of Pension Funds, as well as by pension lawyers and other groups. That issue may arise in our debates on clause 29 but by then, members of the Committee may have forgotten what is involved. There is concern that part II of the schedule, entitled:
	<br><q><p>"Amendment of Enactments Relating to Employment"</p></q>
will come into effect in July, but part I will not come into effect until January 1993. The bodies involved want to know the effective date of the repeal of the current equal requirements in sections 53 to 56 of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975, which is being repealed in schedule 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that I am leaping about in the Bill, but the different dates of implementation are relevant. Can the Minister say anything which will clarify the position on the Government's intention to amend employment law this year and the requirement for schemes to comply from 1 January 1993, as there is much anxiety among pension providers about the issue?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the last point, there has been some confusion and doubt about the compliance dates. They all come into effect on 1 January 1993. It is not a question of having some bits now and some bits later. They all hang together—one impinges on another. To have anything other than a single date would be impractical and undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spoken before about the point made by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) about the need to reach a conclusion on the state pension scheme. It is a complicated matter, which would require sweeping changes, as the hon. Lady recognised. As the matter has such an impact beyond the state system, we have to tread carefully and think through the details. Partly because of changes in pension schemes, partly because of the progress of equal treatment and partly to keep us in line with the directives which we have helped to shape, we must ensure that the changes that we introduce will not have to be changed because the directives require something different. We have a difficult path to tread. I agree with the hon. Lady that it is important to have wide discussion on the matter and that there should be as little delay as possible before the schemes for the way forward are publicly debated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can say no more than that at present, but we are very alive to the interest that outside organisations have in coming to a conclusion on the matter, or at least being able to see the way forward. In that sense, I accept what the hon. Member for Derby, South says.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>970</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 303, in page 35, leave out lines 29 and 30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments: No. 309 in page 35, line 30, leave out ", wife or other dependants" and insert "or wife".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No. 310, in page 35, line 30, at end insert
	<br><q><p>"to the extent that the difference is justifiable by analogy with benefits payable from the National Insurance Fund'.</p></q>
I remind the Committee that part I of Schedule 3 deals with
	<br><q><p>"Schemes to comply with the principle of equal treatment",</p></q>
which is followed by provisions explaining the prinicple. Paragraph 4(d) sets out the exemption, states that no account shall be taken of
	<br><q><p>"any difference of treatment in relation to benefits for a deceased member's surviving husband, wife or other dependants".</p></q>
That is an unacceptable exemption because it can create great differences between widows and widowers who are left to bring up children, even though the cost of bringing up the children can be the same for both. The only justification for treating widows, widowers and their children unequally is that such inequalities exist in the state scheme. Those inequalities are a traditional hangover from the Beveridge assumption that all breadwinners are male. That is fair enough in a historical context, but it is totally inappropriate now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state scheme is gradually moving towards equal treatment. We welcome the statement of the acceptance of the principle of equal treatment, even though we shall wrangle about the exemptions. Occupational pension schemes should have no excuse for not coming into line with the state scheme and moving towards equal treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would remove the exemption of survivors' benefits. That is our starting block on the lead amendment in this group. If the Minister does not accept amendment No. 303, there is a fall back in amendment No. 309, which would retain the exemption for widows' and widowers' benefits, but not for children's benefits. That is an extremely modest proposal, which would cost the Government little to implement. It would remove an indefensible form of discrimination. The need for help with the costs of bringing up dependent children is just as great—if not greater—if the mother, rather than the father, dies. The mother is still the primary carer of children in our society. We must allow for that, but not by leaving this exemption provision as it stands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 310 would prevent occupational schemes from discriminating in survivors' benefits to a greater extent than the state scheme. The amendment would bring the occupational schemes into line with the state scheme. The provision at present permits any inequality with regard to such benefits. They could be moved right apart from the principle which I believe that all members of the Committee now accept. As the state scheme moves towards more equal treatment, occupational schemes should at least move into line with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that amendment No. 310 is unexceptional.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0558">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>971</span>
The Government might like to consider removing the exemption altogether, but I urge the Under-Secretary, at the very least, to accept amendment No. 309. It would retain the exemption for widows' and widowers' benefits, but not for children's benefits. In that way there would be some equality in the impact and direction of the primary purpose, which is the key difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have written to me, as I am sure they have written to Conservative Members, about what happens in practice with such discrimination. Widowers, in particular, have written saying that they feel discriminated against, in that they receive less for looking after their children, and that it might have been better if they had died instead of their partner, as the family's financial circumstances would then be different. It is unacceptable that people should think like that in those circumstances. We can do something positive by accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 303, 309 and 310 all in some way remove the exception to the principles of equal treatment which the schedule permits in respect of survivors' benefits. Amendment No. 303 would require schemes to provide a widower's benefits on the same terms as they provide a widow's benefits. Amendment No. 310 would require equal treatment for widows, widowers and dependants where the difference in treatment was not justifiable by difference in treatment in state scheme benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have recently made major strides in bringing occupational benefits to widowers on the same terms as for widows and are continuing to do so. Since last April, it has been a condition of schemes being used for contracting out of SERPs that they provide a widower's pension GMP on the same terms as for widows' pensions and from their introduction the new contracted-out money purchase schemes have been required also to provide a widower's pension deriving from the protected rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In schedule 4 we are introducing a provision which will for the first time extend to widowers' benefits the preservation requirements for early leavers. A woman who leaves her employment will be able to ensure that the rights which she has earned to widowers' benefits will be preserved for payment to her widower on her death. This provision is part of the ongoing policy of making improvements to pensions provision in respect of equal treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having stated what we have done and are doing in improving conditions for widowers to bring them into line with widows, I am still recommending to the Committee that it oppose the amendments. The draft third social security directive has been proposed by the European Commission and is currently being considered by the Council of Ministers. When the directive will be adopted and in what form it is impossible currently to say, as it is the subject of negotiation. Nevertheless, the draft directive brings forward a number of proposals, such as the abolition of derived rights, which could have a considerable effect in the sphere of widows' and widowers' benefits and also benefits for other dependants of the deceased scheme member. There are a number of issues which are at variance with our practice in the United Kingdom, and with our policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>972</span>
Some proposals in the draft directive could be unworkable with our present policy, and certainly with the kind of changes that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) is suggesting, although I have some sympathy with him. It would be wrong to make further changes in present schemes in respect of widows, widowers and dependants, when we may find, as the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said, that we have to change them in the near future. I suggest the blanket withdrawal of the amendments because the time is not right for substantial changes. We should wait to see what we negotiate with Brussels to make sure that the schemes do not vary, causing expense and difficulty, more than they must.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a misunderstanding between the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). My hon. Friend was concerned that such matters might be settled in the directive, and that all we could do would be to decide how to implement it. He was expressing concern about the nature of the negotiations on the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the problem with directives on every subject. They are a matter of negotiation. There is widespread interest in some, and a wider debate than between just the representatives of the countries taking part. However, that is not so with most.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Select Committee of the House of Lords is taking a close interest in the current negotiations on the draft directive on equal treatment. I have been before it once, and I am due to go again next week. It produces reports of its proceedings. It has interviewed many people from this country, and a Commission official from the EC. It not only provides a wealth of information and ideas, but has been a platform in which some problems have already been exposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wider the debate on the directive, the happier the Government will be. These matters are important and complicated. If the hon. Member for Leeds, West read the directive, he will see that the line of thinking
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0559">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>973</span>
along which the EC is moving at present is different from ours over the idea of dependency and survivors' benefits and the theory that there should be benefits derived from the contributions of another. That is different from what we have here, and different from the assumptions contained in the amendments. Therefore, although I have sympathy with some of the hon. Gentleman's aims, it is the wrong time to introduce detailed changes which would impinge heavily on occupational pension schemes. It would result only in adjustments being made in the near future when the final directive is issued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I became increasingly worried during the Minister's speech. It is not satisfactory to say that this is not the right tiime to discuss our amendments, as the legislation on the matter is being sorted out in relation to the EEC directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members agreed on the principle of equal treatment. It seems that the tenor of the directive is to bring legislation towards equal treatment. The Under-Secretary of State seemed to say that the EEC is pushing in the opposite direction. If that is so, it is imperative for us to put down some firm markers, and say that that is not the direction in which we wish to see our social security and pension law go. How can we do that if we cannot discuss the matter in Committee because the timing is not right? How is it that Opposition Members do not get invited to the House of Lords Select Committee? Perhaps when the Under-Secretary attends again, he will say that Opposition Members feel great disquiet over the fact that we cannot put down firm markers to suggest what the policy should be. It is fundamental, not just in terms of academic concern on the drawing up of law in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to the lives of thousands of people. Many people have a great interest in pension rights and equal treatment of men and women, and, in terms of the amendments, between widows and widowers. I hope that we can discuss those matters in Parliament so that we have a full input. If nothing else, we should agree a view. I accept that the Government's view may be different from that of the Opposition and that we may not reach a consensus on the direction of the policy. However, it is important that we send clear statements to the EEC on the directive and do not simply wait for the directive to be made, and then have a discussion in the Chamber on how on earth we intend to implement it when, as the Under-Secretary of State has suggested, it goes in a different direction from the policy that we would prefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment now, but I suggest that we return to the matters that have been raised. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 304, in page 35, line 32, after "available", insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 313, in page 39, line 20, at end insert—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>974</span>
	<br><q><p>"(iv) any arrangement for the payment of voluntary contributions by a member of a retirement benefits scheme which is approved by the Board of Inland Revenue under Chapter 1 of Part XIV of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988;".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment deals with the wording of subparagraph (4)(e) and any difference of treatment in relation to optional provisions. The wording seems to allow almost any discrimination in optional benefits, although the Minister keeps telling us that the schedule moves as far as is practicable and reasonable towards equal treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the implications of various decisions for actuarial grounds for pensions calculations and so on has arisen under a number of amendments. Amendment No. 304 specifically restricts the wording of the subparagraph on optional benefits to what can be justified on reasonable actuarial grounds. If the general thrust of the directive is that there should usually be equal treatment in pension provision for men and women, the only valid reason for discrimination is that optional benefits for women are likely to be more costly than similar benefits for men because of the difference in life expectancy to which the Minister and my hon. Friends have already referred. That difference could be taken into account by varying the additional contribution on an actuarial basis, which the amendment would allow. Without the amendment, the scheme would be able to offer a range of options to men which were simply not available to women. That would not be necessary or desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 313 raises the issue of additional voluntary contributions. We are probing that issue because it has been raised with us by the Association of British Insurers. It feels that, as the schedule is drafted, there are a number of uncertainties surrounding its interpretation, which make it difficult to judge, in particular, its impact on schemes of additional voluntary contributions, including free-standing additional voluntary contribution schemes. The association believes that such schemes should be expressly excluded from the provisions of the schedule, because otherwise there would be a risk of limiting the individual's capacity to make contributions over and above those which are required as a condition of scheme membership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 313 is in the form that the association has suggested. We recognise that paragraph 2(4)(e) already exempts
	<br><q><p>"any difference of treatment in relation to any optional provisions".</p></q>
If those who are expert in the matter—certainly more so than I and, I dare say, the Minister—question whether the drafting of the schedule covers the point, it would be useful to clear up the matter in case there is a need to clarify whether the differences between the sexes based on actuarial conditions are permissible. As the Minister will know, we have reservations about the extent of such derogations, but is is important for the intention of the legislation to be clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 304 would exclude optional provision in a scheme from the principle of equal treatment only where any differences in treatment arise from actuarial factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EC directive which claue 19 and the schedule would implement specifically permits the exclusion of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>975</span>
the optional provisions of a scheme from the principle of equal treatment. Therefore, the schedule reflects the derogations contained in the directive and should be considered in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The options covered are those which the individual may choose to take and for that reason they are not mandatory provisions of the scheme. In making his or her choice the individual will be fully aware of the implications of doing so, and if the option available is not to the member's liking, the member need not exercise the option. The first of the three options covered relates to additional voluntary contributions. Members who are dissatisfied with the terms of "in-house" AVCs because of their exclusion from the principle of equal treatment, have the opportunity to shop around for a free-standing AVC scheme. The possibility of competition is likely to have a greater effect on "in house"AVC arrangements that the adoption of this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second option relates to the date on which benefits commence. If a member chooses to retire early and to take a pension before normal age, the resulting pension may be adjusted to take account of actuarial factors. A man retiring at 60, where the scheme's normal pension age is 65 for men and 60 for women, may receive an actuarially reduced pension lower than that of the woman retiring at 60 which is her normal pension age. That, however, is his choice. The provision does not apply to compulsory early retirement or redundancy or severance because the question of choice does not then the arise and a salary-related scheme would be required to pay the man in my previous example the same pension as a woman retiring at the same age with the same length of pensionable service and the same final salary. The third option relates to the choice between two or more benefits. There will be no requirement to provide the choice when to change, for instance, from ill health to retirement benefit on identical terms for men and women.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of these provisions imposes any form of discrimination of scheme members. They permit a member to make a choice to exercise a discretion available under scheme rules. There is no obligation to do so and in doing so the member will be made aware of the circumstances and the consequences. The amendment would effectively remove the choice from either men or women as schemes currently providing the options would be likely to withdraw them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our consultation exercise last summer, we made it clear that the provisions in the Bill were not intended to cover those optional arrangements. There is no requirement on an individual to take on an option but schemes can modify their provisions and offer different ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, for the reasons that I gave, I cannot accept that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 313 would include within the definition of the term "exempt scheme" arrangements to provide additional voluntary contributions. As an exempt scheme, these arrangements would not be "employment related benefit schemes", so the principle of equal treatment and the overriding legislation to achieve equal treatment would not apply to them. Additional voluntary contributions are optional
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>976</span>
arrangements which enable members of occupational pension schemes to pay contributions additional to the contributions that they are required to pay to their scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Additional voluntary contributions come in two varieties. There are what are frequently known as "in-house" AVCs. These are arrangements made by the member's own scheme to enable additional pensions to be earned in that scheme. There are other arrangements called "free-standing AVCs" which enable a member of an occupational pension scheme to pay contributions to, and to draw additional pension, from, a pension provider other than the member's own scheme, that is an insurance company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We never intended that the equal treatment requirements should apply to AVCs whether "in-house" or free-standing. Indeed, the exceptions already provided in the schedule cover AVCs thereby rendering the amendment superfluous. Paragraph 2(4)(e) of the schedule provides that in determining whether a scheme complies with the principle of equal treatment no account shall be taken of any difference of treatment in relation to any optional provisions available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2(8) defines these to include provisions of a scheme that apply only in the case of members who elect for them to do so and whose purpose is to secure for those members benefits in addition to those otherwise provided under the scheme. That is what "in house" AVCs are. The existing definitions of "exempt scheme" in paragraph 7(b) cover free-standing AVCs. If the provider is an insurance company the arrangement is a
	<br><q><p>"contract of insurance which is made for the benefit of employed earners only and to which the employer is not a party".</p></q>
Where the provider is not an insurance company a free-standing AVC will be a personal scheme for an employed earner to which the employer does not contribute. Indeed, as the arrangement is made between the individual and the provider it will also come within the definition of a scheme with only one member which is not a personal scheme to which the employer contributes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As AVCs of both kinds are already covered by the schedule we do not consider that amendment No. 313 is necessary. Nevertheless, as it is our intention that the equal treatment requirements should not apply to AVCs, we are prepared to have another look at their position to ensure that the schedule does not apply to AVCs. In the light of my undertaking to reconsider the issue I hope that the hon. Member for Derby, South will be content not to pursue the amendment. If we find that the provision applies after all, we shall introduce an amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

At first, I wondered whether sub-paragraph (4)(e) meant that different options could be offered to people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>977</span>
of different sexes. The Minister appears to have said that they can in the case of optional benefits. I am touched by the Minister's faith that those who are offered such options will know precisely what they are being offered and whether the offer is different from that which would be made to someone of a different sex. I do not share his faith. No one in his right mind, when trying to sell optional extras to a woman, would say, "By the way, if you were a man we could offer you a much better deal. You would get better benefits on more favourable terms." If the Minister believes that the legislative controls over the selling of such schemes go that far, I am delighted to hear it and hope that he will be proved right, but I doubt whether that will be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that an actuarial reduction might be applied. It almost certainly will be applied, unless the subject were a privileged early retirer such as, to take a random example, the chief executive of Westminster city council. Almost invariably, the pension of someone who retires early is actuarially reduced. I recognise that sometimes the individual has had a free choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I was saying that people do not always choose early retirement—sometimes they are pushed in that direction. The Minister said that we were not discussing redundancy or similar arrangements. I am sure that he will recall—the Minister of State will certainly recall it—that we have drawn to the attention of Committees considering previous Social Security Bills the fact that people who are forced into early retirement on grounds of ill health or who take what is described as early retirement when they are really being made redundant can be forced to draw on their pension entitlement even when that is to their disadvantage and the pension will be actuarially reduced because otherwise their income would be too low to manage on. It is right to remind the Committee that not everyone who takes early retirement does so advantageously. We have placed the matter on record and the Minister believes that it will be made clear. In view of his agreement to consider amendment No. 313, I beg to ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 304.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The amendment would make the equal treatment requirement between men and women apply to pensions and other rights that have already accrued. It would involve additional costs, but the alternative is that unequal pension provisions will continue well into the middle of the next century. Although there are great announcements that there will be equal provision for men and women in the future, it will take a long time for that to take effect for people in the real world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that the number of schemes with different pension entitlements between men and women is now very small, so I should like the Minister to say what the costs of accepting our amendment would be. How long must people wait for such rights? Have the Government done their sums?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it would not be too costly to accept our amendment, the Government should seriously consider doing so, otherwise we shall be making a promise to women that they will have the same pension rights as men in the future, even though the majority of them will not receive the benefit of those rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply briefly to the recommendation of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short). I understand the thoughts behind the amendment but I am unable to accept it. I cannot give her the figures for which she asked, as the amendment would have a different impact on different schemes. It is possible that some schemes could accommodate the change requiested, but there are others that are not funded in such a way as to provide benefits for which no contributions have been built up in the past. Therefore, it would be wrong, even if it were desirable to make that change—I concede that it would be desirable in many ways—to place an obligation on schemes that neither expect to meet nor could meet that requirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons, I suggest that the amendment should not be pressed. The changes will affect future as well as existing and new scheme members, but obligations cannot be undertaken if no contributions have been made in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister clarify the time impact of the Bill? Will it apply only to those who start on a pension scheme when the provision takes effect, or will it also apply to part of someone's pension payment when the Bill is implemented?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The new rules must come into effect by 1 January 1993, although it will be possible for schemes to change their provisions before then. The hon. Lady asked whether there would be a retrospective effect.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>979</span>
I cannot give her a categorical answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equal treatment will apply to rights accruing after that 1993 date, but schemes can change their rules at any time and some will wish to do so before 1993. The hopes of the hon. Member for Ladywood will be met after 1993, when women will have the full entitlement that male members of the scheme would have for the contributions that they are then paying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was a disappointing response, because it sounds as though the Government have not done the work. If equal treatment is desirable, it is desirable for everyone who retires from now onwards. Whether we can afford to implement the provision depends on the costs, but the Minister says merely that some schemes could afford it and others could not. He has no further statistics. Perhaps more limited backdating could be arranged, if the Government examine the costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms. Short), I am reminded of an example about which I have recently had correspondence, as my hon. Friend may also have had some.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In public sector schemes, the Government have introduced a provision allowing widowers equal treatment in respect of rights accrued in future. For a limited period, people will be able to buy back those rights. All the pensions experts and those who have carried out an actuarial assessment of the scheme, including the unions, agree that under the present funding arrangements the Government could afford to provide those rights for existing scheme members. The Government choose not to do so, although they offer people the option to buy those rights. My hon. Friend has raised a pertinent question about what we could afford, as opposed to what we choose to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Does that apply to teachers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And public service pensioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we have all received letters from teachers in particular, who are extremely angry. As part of the move towards equal treatment, women are allowed to provide protection for their male partners if the woman dies first, yet women teachers have to buy back those rights. As they point out, we—poor, frail creatures that we are—live considerably longer than men. It is odd that women teachers who have paid the same as men must make additional payments to protect their male partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By rejecting the amendment the Minister is telling us that the boast about equal treatment, which was welcomed by the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe), will fully affect only those who have not yet even entered a pension scheme. It will be 20, 30 or 40 years before women in Britain—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Sixty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Forty—it will be 40 years before there is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>980</span>
full equality of treatment. The changes will be phased in. From 1993 at the latest, the payments that we make will have to be equal, so we shall get a mixed pension with provision for equality in some respects and inequality in others. The breakthrough will not occur, and there will not be equal treatment for all women for a considerable time. The Minister says that he cannot accept the amendment and does not know how expensive it would be to arrange backdating. That is shoddy work. Unless he has any more information I shall urge my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Member for Ladywood. The amendment is a sweeping one, and I do not think that it is reasonable to require the huge variety of different pension schemes that exist to backdate benefits for women. They are not funded for that and they may not have the resources. The changes that we are introducing will mean that rights earned after 1993, or before that if the schemes should change their rules earlier will generate equal benefits and pensions, but it would be unreasonable and in some cases quite unmanageable to impose those requirements upon schemes retrospectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our view is that the full impact of the amendment could hit some pension schemes that could not afford it, but that a more limited backdating would be possible and should be considered. We hope to come back to this issue and we expect the Government to consider it more fully and look at partial backdating, which they should implement if at all possible. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 307, in page 38, line 51, leave out from "normally" to end of line 52 and insert

No one would say that the Bill is a particularly far-sighted or compassionate measure. Indeed it is shortsighted and uncompassionate and is therefore probably in line with the times in which the Government would like us to live. Under the amendment, an equal treatment requirement is applied to any family leave provisions in an employment-related benefits scheme. That is quite important because a considerable number of people are now getting various forms of special leave from work that would come under the heading of family leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are obviously maternity provisions and increasingly large numbers of paternity provisions. There is, and always has been, compassionate leave after the death of a near relative or dependent. Increasingly, if parents with small children are to be able to work effectively their employers must understand that they need special leave when their children are ill or cannot be looked after. The amendment ensures that people in receipt of special leave because of any of those considerations do not suffer as a result. My understanding is that at present they would suffer because not all family leave schemes include full remuneration while off work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>981</span>
Family leave provisions are not particularly common in this country. Moreover, becaue of the family patterns in our society, many women are responsible for looking after children or elderly, dependent or semi-dependent relatives. If employers are serious about recruiting older women back into the work force, they msut be prepared to make the necessary leave provisions for them to take care of their other responsibilities. That is not to say that only women should be responsible for looking after children or elderly relatives, but the general trend is unfortunately in that direction at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under paragraph 6, schemes would be required to comply with the normal leave requirements—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the record, 70 per cent of the care of the elderly or those with disability is provided by women at home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is correct. The number of people looking after elderly, dependent relatives is likely to increase, not necessarily in proportion, because the amount of in-care available from local and health authorities is diminishing as the Government plead the arguments for community care. I shall not press the Minister for an answer on it now, but we are still awaiting the Government's answer to the Griffiths report on community care. I mention that fact, although it is not strictly relevant to the amendment, because I know that you will not mind, Mr. Winterton. I hope that you will also not mind if the Minister goes beyond the scope of the amendment in replying to my query about the Griffiths report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly shall object. I could not mind about what the hon. Gentleman has just said, because I did not know what he was about to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It helps to be unpredictable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I was saying, under paragraph 6 of the schedule, schemes will be required to comply with the normal leave requirements. The person's rights under the scheme must continue to accrue as though he or she were working normally but receiving only the remuneration paid during family leave. If someone received only half pay during a period of family leave, he would get only half his benefit rights or less, depending on how the benefits were calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important part of the nub of my argument. At present, most leave provisions from most employers include the entitlement to full pay. In most public sector employment, someone who is off sick gets half pay after six months; after a year, the pay goes down to zero. Maternity leave is taken on full pay for the statutory minimum number of weeks. In some cases, local agreements can take the leave up to six months or even a year. Quite often, however, women taking maternity leave like to take a few months extra at half pay or no pay at all, so that they can be longer with their child before it goes to the child minder or nursery. Those women would lose out on pension entitlement because they were on less than full pay for part of the time that they were on special leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>982</span>
If both parents are working and their child becomes ill, clearly it is not suitable for the child to go to the nursery or child minder. One of the parents has to take leave. If it is only for a day or two, employers normally count that as sick leave. However, if the person has to take more time off, he or she may have to take unpaid leave to care for the sick child. According to the schedule, the parent would then lose entitlement to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Lady wood (Ms. Short) said, many people are responsible for the care of elderly, dependent relatives. Such carers are largely unrecognised. They do an enormous amount of work, often giving up all forms of hobbies and leisure activities and often having to give up work altogether to care for their elderly relatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If agreement is reached with an employer to take a period of leave, whether at half pay or no pay at all, there should be some means of recognising that fact when drawing up the regulations. In that way, people who have had to take leave during their working life will not suffer when it comes to their pension entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an anomaly in the way that the provisions have been drawn up. Paragraph 5 provides that benefits accrued during maternity leave must be based on the amount that the woman would have earned if she had been working normally, not the amount that she was paid on maternity leave. That is not a contradiction of what I said earlier, because I referred then to women who had taken extra maternity leave. There is a difference between the provision of family leave for reasons of dependency or bereavement, and the provision, which I support, relating to maternity leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 307 would remove that difference. Benefit rights would be fully protected during the family leave in the same way as during maternity leave and would be based on the person's full normal earnings. The amendment would help the many people in employment who have to take leave at various times and who, in some cases, lose out on income—although I accept that some employers are more reasonable in giving extended time off. I do not see why the pension arrangements of such people should be penalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that it is impossible to quantify the kind of demand that I am making, but the Minister will recognise that his counterparts at the Department of Employment are urging women to return to work. Many are skilled workers who have taken time off to bring up children and so on. They often have other responsibilities and those responsibilities must be recognised if we are to have an effective work force and if the pension arrangements of those people are not to be penalised because of lack of provision in this Bill. I hope that the Minister is prepared to accept the spirit of amendment No. 307.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond briefly to the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn). The arrangements for maternity leave that are set out in the schedule are satisfactory—he said—until leave is extended at a reduced rate of pay or no rate of pay. There is less problem if there is no rate of pay, but a reduced rate of pay could affect pension entitlement as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>983</span>
it could affect the final salary, depending on when retirement occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred also to family leave, which is usually of short duration. In most, or certainly many, jobs it is at the full rate of pay; there is no effect on contributions and, therefore, on entitlement. However, I accept that there could be circumstances in which, over a prolonged period or by agreement, it was at a reduced salary or wage and there could be a detrimental effect on pension rights. Therefore, I perceive that there could be a difficulty in some cases, and I should like to think further about what he has said and to consider whether there is a real problem and whether there is an effective and practical way to improve the position through regulations. I do not undertake to find that there is a problem that needs to be addressed or a way to address it. Having proferred that rather bedraggled olive branch to the hon. Gentleman, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether it is a bedraggled olive branch; it is more like last autumn's branch dragged out again. The Minister is pretending that it is a gift of the spring. I take it in the spirit that is meant because I am a generous person. As I understand it, the Minister hopes and thinks, that there is not a problem but will have a cursory glance to make sure that there is not one. I hope that I am not being unkind and unfair, and that he will agree with me that there is a problem. If he is prepared seriously to consider the difficulties that I have outlined, we are happy to withdraw the amendment. I hope that he will think about what I have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a number of cases, family leave is short. It is on full pay or is taken as the equivalent of sick pay or sick leave and has no effect on the pension entitlement. I understand that. There are other cases where that is not so. For example, I know one family with a teenage son who is dying—he is terminally ill. Both parents want to be with that son as much as they can before he passes away and they will take some weeks off as leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a perfectly understandable wish and something that any of us would do in those circumstances. I hope that provisions will be made to ensure that the parents do not lose out on pension, as they will have to be off for several months. A friend of mine who had an adopted daughter who died of leukemia had several months off work. As it turned out, his employers were very helpful about it, and he did not lose out. However, other employers would not have been able to be as helpful as this employer. Clearly, it would have been wrong if he and his wife had been penalised for having such a period of time off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally, leave following a bereavement in a family would be one or possibly two weeks. I sometimes think that it should be longer, or slightly more flexible, as for many people bereavement involves more than just arranging and attending a funeral. They deal with many different arrangements and emotional upsets for some time after. Often my constituents have to deal with the death of a parent or close relative who lives overseas, in the West Indies, West Africa, the Indian sub-continent or wherever. To return to the Caribbean
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>984</span>
or wherever their family has come from cannot be achieved in a few days; it takes several weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister is prepared to consider carefully the cases that I have mentioned. I hope that he agrees that there is a problem, which can be dealt with by amendment or by the issue of new regulations, to protect people's entitlements. If we can assist with giving further ideas of the kind of problems that arise, we should be happy to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 214, in page 39, line 39, leave out paragraph 8 and insert—
	<br><q><p>"8. Section 15(1) of the 1986 Act (which renders void any provision making membership of a pension scheme compulsory for an employed earner) shall apply in relation to a self-employed earner as it applies in relation to an employed earner, but with the substitution for references to a personal pension scheme of references to an employment-related benefit scheme which would be such a pension scheme if self-employed earners were regarded as employed earners.".</p></q>
We have tabled amendment No. 214 to take account of a number of representations which we have received since the Bill was published. It replaces paragraph 8 of schedule 3 with a substitute paragraph which will restrict its application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8 was drafted to implement a requirement in article 6 of the EC directive which prohibits unequal treatment on ground of sex in determining whether individuals are entitled to be members of a scheme and whether such membership is compulsory or optional. Section 15 of the Social Security Act 1986 has, since April 1988, rendered null and void any provision or any term in a contract of service or rule of an occupational or personal pension scheme which makes membership of the scheme a condition of employment for an employed earner. No scheme covered by the 1986 Act can therefore make membership compulsory for either men or women. The definitions of occupational and personal pensions, however, restricted its application to benefits payable on termination of employment, on retirement or death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 8, as introduced, would simply have extended the provisions of section 15 of the 1986 Act to cover persons and benefits covered by the directive but not covered by section 15 itself. Since the Bill was published, we have had a number of representations from employers and pension schemes pointing out that this would prevent employers making it a condition of employment for an employee to be covered for benefit in the event of an industrial accident or disease or similar eventuality. Whereas employees opting out of an occupational pension scheme have a number of alternative options to provide for their own retirement or their survivors following their death, there is no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>985</span>
equivalent alternative to supplement state benefit provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have decided therefore, that paragraph 8 extended beyond the requirements of the directive. The amendment applies section 15 to self-employed earners, those treated by regulations as not being employed or certain professionals particularly in the NHS who are in occupational schemes. Those categories will not be able to be compelled to be members of a scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the benefits not covered by the 1986 Act, contracts of employment and scheme rules will be able to continue to make scheme membership compulsory or voluntary, but the principle of equal treatment in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the schedule will ensure that there will be no discrimination on grounds of sex, whether membership is mandatory or not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When an employee leaves contracted-out employment and takes up employment where a different occupational pension scheme is in operation, it is possible to transfer any pension rights already carried from one scheme to another. The mechanics of such transfers are contained in the Occupational Pension Schemes (Contracting-Out) Regulations 1984 and a revaluation rate is set to maintain the value of amounts transferred. For periods up to 5 April 1988, the revaluation rate is 8.5 per cent and for later periods it is 7.5 per cent per annum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 218 would correct a defect in the regulations. Although it was intended that revaluation prior to 6 April 1988 would always be at 8.5 per cent, this may not be the case where an employee transfers from scheme A to scheme B before 6 April 1988 and back to scheme A again on or after 6 April 1988. The pension rights which were initially transferred at 8.5 per cent could be transferred back at 7.5 per cent. The amendment ensures that any transfer of pension rights for periods before 6 April 1988 and subsequently transferred again will always be revalued at 8.5 per cent per annum, irrespective of whether the pension rights go back to the original or any other scheme.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 314, in page 42, leave out lines 16 to 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 64 of the Social Security Act 1973 gives the Occupational Pensions Board power to make an order modifying its scheme or authorising its modifications. Section 64(7) provides that the board shall not make any order that may result in a diminution of a member's entitlement without his consent, unless it is
	<br><q><p>"satisfied that it is in the interests of the generality of members."</p></q>
Paragraph 3 of schedule 4 will water down that safeguard by making regulations waiving or modifying subsection (7) "in prescribed circumstances". The notes on clauses do not say for what purpose this extremely important regulation-making power would be used. It has been suggested that the reason for it is that the Occupational Pensions Board has been refusing to modify schemes to allow employers to take money out of the fund on the grounds that it would not be in the interests of the generality of members. If that is so, we feel that the OPB is right to use its powers to stop employers from taking money out of the fund in that way, and it should continue to refuse to make such modifications. In case the Government have that in mind, amendment No. 314 proposes to delete paragraph 3 of the schedule. I look forward to hearing the Government's intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would remove the proposal for a regulation-making power to provide that section 64(7) of the Social Security Act 1973 shall not apply, or shall apply with prescribed modifications. Section 64 of that ACT empowers the Occupational Pensions Board to authorise the modification of an occupational or personal pension scheme, to modify such a scheme itself, or to direct or authorise its winding up. The purposes for which the OPB may exercise those powers are specified in section 64 or in regulations made under that section. They include modifications to meet the conditions for contracting out of SERPS, to meet conditions for approval by the Inland Revenue, to provide for transfers to other schemes and to comply with the preservation requirements. The board may use its powers only if it is satisfied that the modification or winding up of the scheme cannot be achieved in any other way, or can be achieved only with considerable delay or difficulty, perhaps because of the need to obtain the consent of all the members, some of whom cannot be traced.

Subsection (7) further restricts the board's powers. It may not make a modification or winding up order unless it is satisfied that it is reasonable to do so. It may

not make an order which might result in an actual or potential entitlement of a member of a scheme, in respect of a past period, being diminished or curtailed without the consent of the individual concerned, unless
	<br><q><p>"it is in the interests of the generality of members".</p></q>
The board looks carefully at each case to decide whether it has the power to make an order and, if so, whether it is appropriate to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 of schedule 4 would give powers to make regulations to provide that in specific circumstances, subsection (7) should not apply in whole or in part. Such regulations would, in the circumstances specified, permit the board to make an order which would diminish or curtail a member's rights without his consent where it was not in the interests of the generality of members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>988</span>
Let me give an example of the circumstances in which the power might be needed. We shall shortly be considering Government amendment No. 216 which, together with paragraph 4 of schedule 4, will extend to widowers the rights currently available in respect of windows' benefits in respect of the preservation of pension rights or early leavers. One of the provisions in that amendment relates to the forfeiture of pensions rights. To give a power to forfeit an individual's pension rights may appear draconian and certainly is not in the interests of the generality of members. The circumstances in which the rights may be forfeited result from the pensioner's bankruptcy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
