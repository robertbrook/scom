<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving to that part of the Bill which has serious implications. We can now discuss how the provisions relating to "actively seeking employment", which we discussed on clause 7, affect the provision of a basic level of income support. An unemployed person who is claiming income support will in future have to show not only that he is available for work but that he is actively seeking employment in exactly the same way as someone who is claiming unemployment benefit. There is one crucial difference: income support is a benefit of last resort. It is a benefit for people who have no other source of income. It might cause a person problems and distress to suspend his entitlement to unemployment benefit but he might retain a residual right to income support, although not if another member of the family is in full-time work. To remove his entitlement to income support, as the clause might do, could result in total destitution not only for the claimant but for his family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 112 tries to protect families from this threat be exempting from the "actively seeking
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
employment" test, for income support purposes only, a claimant with a child. We have defined a child, according to the 1986 Act, as a person under 16. That does not mean that someone might not lose his entitlement to unemployment benefit under clause 7, but while there is a child in the household who needs sustenance and support he would not lose his right to income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are considering this clause alongside the test of availability for work. Families can lose entitlement to income support at present if it is decided that the claimant is not available for work. Under the old supplementary benefit regulations which operated from 1980 to 1988, if it was decided that someone might not be available for employment, urgent needs payments could be made, subject to the 40 per cent. voluntary unemployment deduction, although only if there were no other means of preventing serious damage to the health or safety of the claimant or any member of his family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That limited safeguard was omitted from the original version of the income support regulations which were tabled under the 1986 Act. However, the Government either gave way at the last minute or realised that they had been in error. One of the many changes that were made a few days before they came into force was the insertion of regulation 8(3) in the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987. That regulation made income support payable to someone who failed the availability test if he or a member of his family would otherwise suffer hardship. As with the old supplementary benefit system, the payments were subject to the 40 per cent. deduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has suggested that the provisions will apply in the same way to those who are not actively seeking employment. In our debate on clause 7 on 2 February, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Of course, the hardship provisions would continue to exist. That is, income support regulations would include a power to allow claimants to receive a reduced rate of income support for weeks when the new test is not satisfied if the claimant was able to satisfy the adjudication officer that he or a member of his family would suffer hardship. That is the current practice with availability and we propose to carry it forward with the 'actively seeking work' test."</p></blockquote>
But when my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) asked how long it would take for such hardship payments to come through, the Minister showed rather less confidence that the Department of Social Security had worked out the details. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The decision could be made on the same day, I think. If the benefit is to be withdrawn, the facility would be given for the claimant to discuss his income support entitlement and the decision could be made that day."</p></blockquote>
I emphasise the word "could". The Minister continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that that would be so in the overwhelming majority of cases." [	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 2 February 1989; c. 268.]</p></blockquote>
I can well understand why the Minister used such phrases as "I think", "I hope" and "the facility would be given". As all hon. Members recognise—although some are more ready than others to admit it—real life in the Departments of Employment and Social Security is not like that. To get income support restored on the grounds of hardship is much more
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0323">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
likely to take weeks rather than days, let alone the same day on which unemployment benefit entitlement has been questioned. If it is restored within days, it will probably happen only because the claimant practically lives in the Department of Social Security office until someone gets round to making a decision on his case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the Minister's observations, most people whose benefit is cut off will not receive hardship payments. That is not because there is no hardship. Sheer common sense suggests that very few unemployed people can survive without any income for more than a few days—or even for just a few days—and not suffer hardship. But inevitably DSS staff regard the hardship provision as something to be used only rarely, in the most exceptional cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Few claimants are likely to know about hardship payments unless they seek advice, which they are unlikely to do in the initial stages. It is possible that many DSS and unemployment benefit officials will be unaware of the hardship payment. Even if they are aware of it, they are not likely to mention it, unless they are specifically asked. One of the minor changes made in the Social Security Act 1986 was to remove from the staff, for the first time since 1930, the whole duty to inform people of their rights and ensure that they claimed all the benefits to which they were entitled. The onus is now on the claimant rather than the official.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not believe that amendment No. 122 would open the flood gates to claims from thousands of feckless parents. To qualify for income support at the normal minimum rate, people would still have to pass the availability test. The amendment would protect parents who are still available for work but who, in a particular week, are suspected of not having taken adequate steps to satisfy the "actively seeking employment" test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise that the suspicion that someone is not actively seeking employment will be enough to lead to the suspension of benefit. We already know that the Government are not prepared to allow benefit to continue—we explored that point in our debates on previous clauses and amendments—until the suspicion has been investigated and until a formal decision has been made by the adjudication officer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In most cases where the question of non-availability arises, the adjudication officer eventually decides in the claimant's favour. In availability cases, benefit can continue, pending the adjudication officer's decision, in actively seeking employment cases, families will have no protection, except the hardship provision of regulation 8(3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have emphasised that they are introducing the actively seeking employment test because they believe that the availability test alone provides insufficient pressure. They have said that it is too passive a test and does not require enough of the claimant. So people could pass the availability test, but still have their benefit entitlement called into question under the actively seeking employment test. It would be wrong and dangerous if families had
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
to face the risk of losing all income under that second, more harsh and stringent test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 113 is similar to amendment No. 112, but it refers not to families with children but to claimants who are disabled, or who have a disabled or sick husband, wife or child. We wish to probe the Government's intentions and to offer them a range of alternatives about possible concessions, all of which we should welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 113 does not define the terms "sick" and "disabled", but it provides for those terms to be defined in regulations, which the Government usually tell us they prefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The actively seeking employment test poses the most serious threat to that category of claimant. Single persons in good health may be able to manage for a short time with no income at all, although even then the physical and moral risks are extremely serious, and it is not unknown for people in those circumstances to commit suicide. The risks are infinitely greater for people who are not in good health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On clause 7, we emphasised the fact that many of those who have been ruled fit for light work, in order to save money on sickness and disability benefits, will find it most difficult to meet the actively seeking employment test. A severely disabled man or woman who insists on signing on and looking for work rather than claiming invalidity benefit will be at risk. Many disabled people fiercely cherish their independence and passionately want to do all that they can to be independent. Nevertheless, a person who, perhaps against advice and his or her own best interests, persists in looking for work and signing on may not be able to keep up indefinitely the weekly grind of sending off job applications to satisfy the actively seeking employment test. The Minister told us that the test will be administered sensitively, but that is not stated in the Bill: that is just the Minister's fervently expressed hope. So we must consider what is stated in the Bill and how peope in such circumstances may be affected by the law as well as by the practice of the local DSS office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A woman with a seriously ill husband who is genuinely looking for work, but who is too preoccupied in any given week or fortnight with the needs and difficulties of her husband's illness to make the weekly quota of job applications could also be affected. There is a danger that in a family with a disabled child, with perhaps both parents looking for work and sharing the responsibility of caring for the child, neither parent may satisfy an official, particularly a young and relatively inexperienced one, that he or she is sufficiently actively seeking employment. Those examples are hypothetical now, but they will become real, once the test is in operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 113 would not exempt those people from the requirement to be available for work—a test which has been sufficient for many years and which would remain—but they would be protected form the risk of the arbitrary withdrawal of their only source of income on the suspicion of not actively seeking employment. We have emphasised that that suspicion could lead to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0324">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
suspension of benefit at a minimum for a period of four weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If accepted, amendment No. 115 would mean that section 20(3)(d)(i) would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A person in Great Britain is entitled to income support… (d) except in such circumstances as may be prescribed,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(i) he is available for, and actively seeking employment or hardship will result unless income support is paid to him."</p></blockquote>
Regulation 8(3) of the Income Support (General) Regulations already provides for the payment of income support to a claimant who fails the availability test
	<br><blockquote><p>"for any period when the adjudication officer is satisfied that, unless income support is paid, the claimant or a member of his family (if any) will suffer hardship."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has said that the same hardship provision will apply to people who fail the actively seeking employment test. The amendment would write that into the Bill, instead of leaving it to regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two reasons for suggesting that. First, it is much too important a matter to leave to regulations. Questions of survival, quite literally, may hang on whether and in what conditions income support is payable to someone who either fails, or is simply suspected of failing, the test of actively seeking employment. There are grave doubts both inside and outside the Committee about whether the test is capable of being administered in a way that does not involve a serious risk of injustice in large numbers of cases. In that situation we believe that it should be clearly stated in the Bill that benefit will not be withheld where hardship will result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason for wanting to write the provision into the Bill is that one cannot be absolutely certain that the regulations will, by the time that they are printed, reflect the advice and the assurances that the Minister has given to the Committee. That is not suggesting that the Minister did not give those assurances in good faith. Presumably the first version of the notes on clauses was issued in good faith, but it was speedily followed by a second version—clearly because a different decision had been made. We want to guard against the possibility of a different decision being made between the Bill leaving Committee and the regulations being made. The Government most unwisely failed to accept our suggestion that the regulations should be amendable, so we should have to accept or reject the regulations en bloc. Therefore, the purpose of amendment No. 115 is to remove any temptation to change the policy on hardship payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 129 is still grouped with the other amendments. However, we have decided that it would not achieve what we intend, and with your permission, Mr. Winterton, we do not propose to move it. I mention that merely to clarify the position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee of the words of the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) that she does not intend to move amendment No. 129. However, as it has been selected, of course hon. Members may refer to it, if they so wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This group of amendments has a clear and understandable purpose from the point of view of the Opposition, which is substantially to change the main thrust of the provisions to ensure that in order to be entitled to benefit, whether unemployment benefit income support, people should be actively seeking work. There is a clear difference of view, which will lead me in due course to advise my hon. Friends to reject the amendments. However, I shall deal with the points raised by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) before I deal with the substance of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady had some fun with the gentle caveats that I entered about my assertion that hardship payments would normally be made on the day that they were applied for. It is almost invariably the case that if application is made under the hardship provisions, payment is made on that day. However, even though I have been responsible for social security matters for a short time, I am conscious of the fact that there can be exceptions. I would not want to give an undertaking, which could be shown to be false, that in 100 per cent. of all such cases the payment would be made on the day, but it would be exceptional if such payments were not made on the same day as the application was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South asserted that judgments about whether someone is actively seeking work will be taken whimsically by employment officers. We discussed that fully on an earlier clause. I explained at great length that procedures, advice, counselling and ultimately the warnings that may have to be given to claimants will ensure that no one will decide on a mere whim that a claimant is not actively seeking work. Claimants will have every opportunity to show that they are so doing before there is any question of their being disqualified from benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 112 concerns families in which at least one member is a child. It is extraordinary that the Opposition should disagree with the whole concept of actively seeking work, yet they have not tabled an amendment specifically on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The suggestion that a single person, perhaps with a partner but no child, should be encouraged actively to seek work but that someone with family responsibilities should not is remarkable. Those are precisely the people who need counselling and advice. They need the possibility of being denied benefit to encourage them to seek work. They should be alive to their real responsibilities and should be encouraged in every way to maintain a positive attitude to returning to employment so that they can be responsible for the welfare of their families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 113 is the second leg of the concept expressed in amendment No. 112. It says that someone should be exempt from the actively seeking work condition if a member of his family is sick or disabled. Income support legislation already provides that claimants can receive benefit without having to be available for work if they are looking after a member of the family who is ill, or if they are caring for person, whether that person is a member of the family or not. Those exemptions are in schedule 1
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
to the 1987 income support regulations. The new regulations should ensure that people are exempted from the actively seeking work condition if they belong to one of the categories listed in the 1987 regulations. They include lone parents, or people who are incapable of work or who are receiving invalid care allowance, or people who are temporarily looking after someone in the family who is ill. The amendment goes too wide and is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 115 is another variation on the theme of exempting people from the actively seeking work condition. It suggests that someone would not have to seek work actively if hardship would result if he or she did not receive income support. Under the amendment, someone would not have to try to find work but could just say, "Sorry, I've got to have money in order to save me from hardship, so there's no point in my seeking work". The main duty of a person in such circumstances, however, should be to get himself or herself back to the position of being able to earn a living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, hardship in the event of non-entitlement is a real issue. However, there is already an availability condition, and an identical provision will be made for people who fail the actively seeking work test. That is an appropriate way of dealing with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not completely sure, from what the hon. Lady said, whether the amendment would allow a full rather than a reduced rate of benefit to be paid. I believe, and successive Governments have believed, that to pay a reduced rate of benefit reflects the correct balance between the interests of taxpayers, who are entitled to see benefit paid in accordance with rules that place a sensible obligation on claimants, and those of the claimants themselves. It would be wrong to pay someone who did not satisfy the normal conditions of benefit the same rate as someone who did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 114 allows provision to be made for circumstances in which a person is not to be treated for income support as sick or disabled. Again I refer back to schedule 1 of the 1987 regulations. I have said that we intend to exempt from the need to seek work actively the categories of people in that list. Paragraph 5 of the list refers to people who are incapable of work and paragraphs 6 and 7 refer to certain disabled people. Of course we understand that many disabled people are incapable of work. In those circumstances, they would be exempt under paragraph 5 and the relevant regulations, which will reflect that in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interests of those groups are already properly safeguarded and I see no need for separate regulations to cater for them, as suggested by the amendment. I must therefore ask my hon. Friends and the Committee as a whole, if I can persuade Opposition Members, to reject all the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the Minister with care but also with an increasing feeling of gloom. The Minister says that in tabling the amendments we wish substantially to change the Bill. Certainly we wish to focus attention on this part of the Bill and to
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
modify it. Where a threat to even the most basic income may arise, it is important that the Committee should carefully consider whether this is a penalty that ought to be imposed. It is a different and much more stringent penalty than the withdrawal of unemployment benefit, when there might be the fallback of income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that he believed that it was almost invariably the case that where hardship might occur the overwhelming majority of payments would be made on the day in question. I suppose it is inevitable that those to whom payments are made on the day in question are least likely to arrive on their MP's doorstep. Opposition Members, and perhaps even some Conservative Members, know that many people whose benefits have been withheld for a variety of reasons and who seek payment either under the old urgent needs payments or under the present provisions, do so as soon as the first right to payment is withdrawn. It is not my experience that it is almost invariably the case that where hardship might arise, payment is made in the overwhelming majority of cases on the day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that one of the reasons for that is that the Minister and I do not define the day in the same way. I suspect that the Minister has in mind the day when it has finally been agreed that the claimant or his family might suffer hardship. I would go along with that, although I would not suggest that payment would be made on that day in every case, as too many people are told that the giro is in the post— that familiar phrase that strikes fear into the hearts of all those who live on benefits and pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I concede that in the overwhelming majority of cases, once agreement has been reached that hardship exists, payment is made on that day. That is different from payment being made on the day when entitlement to benefit is questioned. The Minister says that a lengthy procedure will be observed, with infinite care in all cases, so that as soon as there is the possibility of someone's benefit being withdrawn he or she will be told; as those people will have known about it for a considerable time, it will not therefore come as a shock.

People who are told what is expected of them may believe that the requirements are unsustainable or unnecessary, or they may do everything that they have been advised to do in exactly the way suggested. But what will happen if, after all the warnings have been issued, a claimant is told, "I have decided that you are not actively seeking work, so you are not entitled to benefit for the past two weeks"? The claimant having built up two weeks' worth of bills, suddenly discovers that he is not going to get any money. I do not believe that he is going to touch his forelock, say, "All right, guv", walk straight out and rush off to the nearest DSS office. He will spend quite a lot of the day arguing, complaining and trying to persuade the officer who is threatening to withdraw his benefit that it should not be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that, people will have to go to the Department of Social Security office, where they will be told by an official, "I have to check with the Department of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0326">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
Employment office". God knows how long that will take. Then the report will come back, after several hours of waiting—it may be the same day if there is enough time left—and the official will say, "I am sorry, but you cannot have any money, because the Department of Employment says that you are not actively seeking work, so your benefit is being withheld". There will then be another argument about that decision. We all know that that is precisely what will happen. Then the claimant will say things like, "Yes, but what will happen to my family?" What about the electricity bill?", and "My landlord will throw me out if I do not pay him the rent tonight". Then the judgment will have to be made about whether hardship will arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is saying that someone will just have to say that hardship will arise and that he will definitely get the money that day, I am very surprised. But that is not what he is telling us. He said quite explicitly in an earlier debate that there is no way that that will be enough and that it would be ridiculous. I think that it was in our debate on amendment No. 115 when he said that the Government could not possibly write it into the Bill that if people say that they are suffering hardship, they will get some money, even at a reduced rate. So people will have to show that there is hardship. I doubt whether they will be able to do all that on the day they are first told that their benefit will be withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I found it rather offensive when the Minister said in a kindly tone—which was more than a little patronising—that it was particularly important for people with families to be encouraged to seek work actively. He was surprised that Opposition Members had suggested that someone with a family should be given less encouragement to seek work. We have already made it plain that we do not consider that the Bill gives encouragement to anybody. The legislation will goad, harass and potentially persecute the unemployed. I recognise that the Minister perceives the Bill in different terms—or it is Government policy to describe it in different terms. It is quite offensive to talk about encouraging men with families to seek work, as though the Government were doing them a favour by introducing these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you may have observed, Mr. Winteron, I was looking earlier for a reference which I could not lay my hands on immediately. The Government call on the labour market surveys when it suits them. The surveys have led them to say that because a tiny minority of people may not be seeking work as actively as the Government would like, the Bill is necessary. I am certain, however, that the Minister is as aware as I am that those surveys also show that if there are any groups among the unemployed who do not need any encouragement to seek work— whether in the form of goading, sincere help, concern or assistance—it is people with families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's evidence shows clearly that those people, more than any other, are desperately looking for work, no matter—unfortunately—how low the pay. The Government's evidence also shows that those people are prepared to agree that they will accept worse conditions and lower wages than anyone else. Those people need to be told least of all about
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
the care and concern that they should feel for their families and about how they should seek to avoid the hardship of losing all entitlement to benefit and income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No more than a handful of people fail to respond to the stimulus of the needs of their families. The overwhelming majority do respond. They fail the actively seeking work test inadvertently, either because they fail to satisfy the test, or because they fail to satisfy a local officer. The tests are much more subject to the arbitrary views and attitudes of local officers than the Government are prepared to admit. That is why it is outrageous to talk about "giving the encouragement" of the potential withdrawal of all sources of income from people with families. That is unworthy of the Minister. I am surprised at him. All the Government's evidence is that those people need no encouragement to seek work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems clear from the Minister's comments that he envisages people with families losing all income. He referred to people who are incapable of work and carers not having to sign on—as if those categories mean that no one with a sick or disabled relative, or a person who is sick or disabled, would lose their entitlement to benefit because of the "actively seeking work" test—and said that therefore amendments Nos. 113 and 114 were unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Birkenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am against neither interviews nor questionnaires, but does my hon. Friend agree that there are trick questions? People who have not worked for some time and who have family responsibilities will honestly answer that they are not immediately available for work because they cannot go out at that moment to find work, but they would be able to do so, if given some time in which to find cover for the people they look after. If the Government were concerned about carers and the actively seeking work test, they would drop those trick questions from questionnaires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. He is referring to the availability test, which the Government say is so much less demanding than the actively seeking work test. But the Government need a new one, so we have the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has highlighted the potentially arbitrary nature of the tests. Under the clause, the tests could deprive people of all right to any source of income. The Minister says that people who do not need to sign on will not be subject to the test. However, the Minister knows, as does anybody who deals in any depth with social security matters, that many people who have been ruled incapable of work, or whose disability or level of sickness has been accepted, are called in and re-examined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those people say that their conditions have not changed and their general practitioners and consultants say that their conditions have not changed, but the benefit officers employed by the Department may say, "No, we have decided that you are capable of work." They may decide that a person is capable only of light work. I have heard that phrase so many times that I am sick of it. People say, "What does it mean? What light work is there? Who would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0327">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
employ me to do light work?" Nevertheless, on those grounds they lose their invalidity benefit and they have to sign on. They will be caught by the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a person puts down on the questionnaire the sum of £150 as the level of remuneration, could not the adjudication officer interpret that as restricted availability and disqualify him? That is happening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is entirely right. Not only could that happen but it is happening, and it will happen all the more should the Bill become law because it explicitly states that the level of remuneration cannot be a factor that allows someone to put reservations on the sort of work that he or she will seek. However, we all know that that does not mean that people will not be asked. They will be asked questions about the level of remuneration that they are seeking. That will be used as a test of whether they are genuinely available or actively seeking work, or whether the level of remuneration is a restriction that they are choosing to impose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) referred to what I think most people see as trick questions. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) will recall that the Minister told us that the availability test is now a passive test, because the commissioners have ruled that someone needs only to be available and does not need to be taking active steps to seek work. I recollect that in the context of that decision, a senior official in the Minister's Department referred to the fact that people followed a hazardous course in answering trick questions that they did not understand—that they gave what tney thought were commonsensical and truthful answers, and the result was that they were deprived of benefit. There is a good deal of common ground I am certain that in the new actively seeking work test there will be a fresh questionnaire that is even trickier than the last, to which it will be very difficult for many people to reply truthfully without causing someone to raise a doubt about how actively they are seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is simply not good enough to say that a lot of those people will not have to be available for work; a lot of them will. They will now have to show that they are actively seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I intervene on an earlier point that was made by my hon. Friend? She spoke about the way in which our sick and disabled constituents are treated. On that issue, we find that the Government are totally schizophrenic. Over the years, many of my constituents who were on disability benefit have been kicked off disability benefit and on to the unemployment roll. Then somebody said, "Gosh, you are pushing the unemployment total up", so they are now being kicked back off the register and on to disability benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are again seeing the two faces of the Government. One of these faces wants to be nasty and mean-minded to our constituents; the other one
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
says, "Above all, we have to get the unemployment total down." They just do not know how to behave. Our constituents are shunted backwards and forwards, from one category to the other, depending on which part of the Government is winning the argument about whether disabled people have rights to benefit, whether they should cut their benefit and put them on the unemployment list, or whether they should take them off that list and shunt them back on to disability benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It is not so coherent as a definite decision by the Government on how to persecute people in particular circumstances. It is simply a matter of whichever Department is pushing the hardest to defend its budget at any given time. If the Department of Employment is pushing harder to defend its budget and its record, it will advise people that they should not sign on, as my hon. Friend said—obviously we have both had constituents in the same circumstances. It will tell them that there is no work for people like them—which they know perfectly well—that they do not have much chance of getting work and that they should receive disability benefit. The pendulum will swing again, the number of people receiving disability benefit will go up and the Department of Social Security will worry about its budget. Officers will say to claimants, "Well, you are not really all that sick. There must be some work that you can do."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that the Minister's Department does not ring the Birkenhead office and ask whether this is true, I am happy to provide him with names and addresses, with constituents' permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who would have spent their lunchtime on the phone to the Birkenhead office will be even more grateful to my hon. Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are worried about what will happen in the real world, rather than what the Minister hopes will happen—or hopes that we believe will happen. Although people may say that their condition has not improved—and their general practitioner or consultant may say the same—the Department's doctors may say that they detect a noticeable improvement, even though they have spent much less time with the patient than the consultant or general practitioner. I had a constituent whose benefit was questioned, even though it was agreed that her condition had not improved. The adjudication officer, in his wisdom or otherwise, said that although she remained as handicapped as before, she had been handicapped to that degree and in those circumstances for so many years that she must have become accustomed to it, and that would make it easier for her to cope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although such a ruling is not justified by law, it makes us sceptical about some of the Minister's assurances. That is why we are so worried about the wording of the Bill, as opposed to the Minister's theory of how it will be applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
Apart from the people whose incapacity is questioned and who are ruled to be fit for some work or for light work, the question arises about how disability is defined. That also relates to the question of who is accepted as being a carer. Under the new, simplied income support system, many people who find difficulty in obtaining work because they are partly disabled do not fit neatly into the Department's category of being sufficiently severely disabled for them or their carers to need to sign on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not good enough for the Minister simply to say that there are many people who do not need to sign on. We know about them, we regret that, despite their circumstances, they do not, under this Government, need to sign on. We are worried about the people who do need to sign on and who will now be caught by the availability test and by the actively seeking work test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the fall-back position and to whether someone may be entitled to receive some benefit, if he or she can prove hardship. It is not good enough for the Minister simply to say that amendment No. 115 means that anybody can tell the employment service that they will suffer hardship if they do not get benefit or income support, even at a reduced rate. If I thought that that would happen, I should be even more inclined to press the amendment, but I am confident that it will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Partly because of the way in which the change in the income support regulations was shoved through in the past few days, many welfare rights officers, let alone members of the public, do not know that the provision exists. Let us hope that people will be informed that they may be able to claim benefit on the grounds of hardship. Naturally, they will then have to prove that they suffer hardship. They will be questioned about the degree of hardship and what that hardship entails. What does the Minister understand by hardship? From his observations, he seems to be content with the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may misuse the word "encouragement", but I am not sure that I am misusing the word "content". The Minister seems to be telling us that he is quite content to envisage the following sequence of events. Someone with a dependent family is suspected of not actively seeking work and is warned about it. On a given day he is told by officials that they have decided that there is real doubt about that, that he will not get the money he should have received for the last two weeks and that he will have to demonstrate satisfactorily that he is actively seeking work before he will receive benefit again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That person will leave the office knowing that he will receive no income to support his family. He will not even receive two weeks' income at the end of the second two weeks, so his family will have been without income for a month. The Minister casually agrees that that is the case, that this is the encouragement that it must be open to someone to give and that the Government are sure that people with families will welcome the encouragement that that threat to their family's well being represents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does not accept that we should write into the Bill any of these caveats which might
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
safeguard families, he owes it to the Committee to explain what he means by hardship. If someone might be evicted from his home if he does not pay his rent, will that be regarded as hardship? Will needing money to buy the family groceries be regarded as hardship? What will happen to people's fuel bills? What does the Minister think will happen to people who could lose their right to any income at all? This is a serious matter which could cause enormous hardship. The Minister must tell us rather more about what he envisages than he has done so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I explained earlier why I believed that it was wrong to accept the amendments, but I should like to respond to a number of the points that the hon. Lady has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I made it clear on Second Reading, as I have done on numerous occasions in Committee, that the vast majority of unemployed people are keen to get back into work—as are the vast majority of people with family responsibilities. But we believe that a number of people are prepared simply to regard availability for work as a totally passive state. It is therefore right to change that requirement to actively seeking work, so as to give them every encouragement to get back into employment. That would be good for their family life and for the economy as a whole. As unemployment falls, skill shortages will quickly arise again. I do not want to labour that point, as it has been made repeatedly. There is a disagreement between the two sides of the Committee about it, which we will not resolve by debating these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady made much of the possibility that someone will lose all his resources, again implying that that will be the result of a casual decision. When it is decided that a claimant has failed actively to seek work, the steps that he is expected to take to satisfy that requirement will have been explained to him on at least one occasion, and possibly more often. Only later, if he has clearly not taken those steps, will he be deemed not to have satisfied that requirement. He will then be told that he will not get benefit. He can then go to the DSS office, where a section supervisor should be able to decide on the same day whether he will suffer hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hardship is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as "severe suffering or privation". In my view, if it is clear that people will be deprived of any of the essentials of life—a roof over their head, heating, and food for their families—they should qualify for the hardship provision. I stick by my assertion that the hardship provision covers the points raised by the hon. Member for Derby, South, and that, in the vast majority of cases, it should be possible to make the decision on the same day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be some doubt about other resources that the claimant may have. The section supervisor in the social security office will need to be satisfied about the veracity of any statement that has been made. Even so, in the majority of cases, a decision on the same day should be possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point I want to deal with concerns those who are judged to.be incapable of work. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>553</span>
Lady suggested that once someone had been judged incapable of work, that judgment should stand for ever. Of course, some people who are incapable of work will clearly remain in that condition for the rest of their lives. However, there are many others who suffer from a temporary incapacity. In those circumstances, the people responsible for spending the taxpayers' money on benefit should be able to judge whether a person's condition is a continuing one by having another medical examination. When such medical examinations take place, those operating on behalf of the regional medical service will contact the claimant's general practitioner and take his views into account. The officials will then have to decide whether the health of the individual still renders him incapable of work. That seems a sensible precaution, and it will ensure that the taxpayers' money is properly safeguarded. I do not believe that the system will be operated in a harsh or unsympathetic manner. Therefore, I again advise the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I noticed that in his reply, the Minister did not repeat the word "encourage" which so interested Opposition Members. We were strongly reminded of the historic use of the word in the phrase which has the same Latin root, although it is in a different language— "encourager les autres". It was used at the time of Admiral Byng, whose reward was a piece of lead delivered at high velocity. The idea was that one man's death was another man's encouragement. The Minister sees what we know to be a piece of malice— the Government are mining the quarry of intolereance and prejudice that is at the heart of British public opinion and placing a burden on those who are least able to bear it—as an act of encouragement. That seems to demonstrate the Government's infinite capacity for self-delusion.

Many of us are interested in what went on in the mind of the Ayatollah when he made his barbarous statement the other day. I am sure that the Ayatollah, in his mosque, is convinced that he is encouraging writers not to blaspheme the prophet.

We have listened incredulously to the Minister talking about hardship cases being decided in one day. There is a marvellous DSS office in Newport. I have had a long relationship with the people there, both as an MP and a customer. I would never utter a word of criticism against them, but I now find that those sympathetic, highly efficient and professional
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
people are dejected by the decisions that Parliament has forced them to implement.

11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some expert knowledge from two close relatives of mine who worked in a DHSS office for many years. Both confirmed that in the past they had precise instructions on the matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett). "The giro is in the post," means, "I haven't done it yet. I might do it tomorrow or the next day." "The matter is under consideration", means, "I might do it in the next fortnight." "It is under active consideration," means, "I might do it in the next week."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware of the meaning of "The Department is aware of the problem."?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That means, "We've lost the file."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is giving out bromide this morning, and we listen to a civilised man, but we know what the Bill will mean. It is unnecessary. The Department already has an armoury of oppressive weapons to use against the unemployed, and they feel victimised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was intrigued and pleased to hear the Minister say that he recognised the right of people to have a roof over their heads and adequate heating, clothing and food for themselves and their families. That is the first time in many years that I have heard a Conservative Member say that, and I commend the Minister for it—it is a notable step towards civilisation for a member of the Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister said that it was reasonable to stop the benefit of someone who does not actively seek work during a holiday. Given that benefit levels keep people on a knife edge, how are they supposed to keep roofs over their heads, their bellies full and their bodies clothed if they have no income? There is a contradiction in the Minister's comments, welcome though his civilised remarks were.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has spoken about the gentle encouragement. The reality of that is that a 59-year-old miner from Ystradgynlais—where there are 3,000 unemployed and 300 jobs available in the Japanese factory down the road, but it does not employ anybody who is fat, male, or not beautiful— who goes on holiday for a week in Weston-super-Mare is expected to read the national press and apply for the job of Director-General of the BBC. That is the fatuous reality of the Bill. The Minister says that unemployed people on holiday must prove that they are actively—even hyperactively—seeking work. The Bill is a cruel nonsense, and the Minister is painting a false picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our amendments are reasonable and would not upset the balance of the Bill. This is a Frankenstein Bill—it is an ugly monster. We can at least soften the features of the Frankenstein a little, which is all that the amendments seek to do. I am surprised that the Minister does not accept the reasonable arguments
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0330">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
behind the amendments, which would make the Bill more humane.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was glad that you did not allow us to dwell on the question of blasphemy, Mr. Winterton. Given events here in the past few days—particularly the guillotine on the Official Secrets Bill—perhaps the Prime Minister would like to widen the definition of blasphemy to cover criticism of the Government. I am reluctant to say that, even in the comparative privacy of the Committee, lest the idea should commend itself to her.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our experience and understanding of the working of the Department does not tie in with the well-meant encouragement about how fairly and smoothly the Bill will work. The Minister believes that hardship payments will be paid on the day. I redefine that as meaning perhaps on the day on which hardship was agreed. The Minister meant to imply that they might be made on the day of application. Does he believe that? Does research within the Department show the length of time elapsing between applications for hardship payments and payments being made and show that it is anything other than a pious hope that payments are made on the day in question?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke as if no penalty would be suffered if people had wilfully disregarded all the warnings and lost their right to benefit, but people will lose their right to unemployment benefit. We are now discussing whether they will lose all rights to income support. That is a much more dangerous and serious matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister wants us to accept that there is more than just hope behind his assurances. Will he assure us that officials will be instructed to investigate entitlement under regulation 8(3), and to consider whether hardship applies before they cut off benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister resisted an amendment saying that benefit should not be cut off until an adjudication officer's decision has been made on unemployment benefit. We are now discussing income support— the benefit of last resort—paid only under hardship provisions. The minimum that the Government should concede is that written instructions will be given that hardship entitlement should be investigated before income support is removed. The onus should not be on the claimant to know that hardship may arise, and to apply and to justify his case. The Minister said investigation would have to be made into whether some individuals had other resources. In almost all cases some investigation or inquiry will be made before hardship payments are made. Unquestionably, that means delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back repeatedly to the Minister's assurances about the warnings people will get, the sensitive way in which cases will be handled, the opportunities that they will be given to prove that they are being good boys and girls and to satisfy whatever provisions today's adjudication officer has decided that they should meet. The fact remains that none of those assurances are in the Bill and it is unlikely that they will all be in the regulations. We have suggested what should be in the regulations, but they are not drafted, let alone before the House. The Minister's assurances remain pie in the sky. They are not in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) I was as surprised as I was pleased to hear the Minister define hardship in terms of people being deprived of the essentials of life. I was even more surprised when he went on to define those essentials as matters such as shelter, heating or food. Again, we must hope that the discussions of the Committee remain a matter for those who care to peruse the pages of Committee records, because otherwise I have a horrible feeling that the Minister will be moved in the next reshuffle and will be replaced by someone who does not take anything like such a generous view of what are the essentials of life. It shows what we have been reduced to when we are hoping to keep the Minister despite the fact that he is putting the Bill through. The Minister has suggested what he thinks might be regarded as essentials.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend leaves the subject of the essentials of life, may I ask her a question? I am glad that she, too, noticed what the Minister said. The Opposition all agree that everyone is entitled to a roof, food and clothing for themselves and their families. Does she not think that the Bill should make provision for all the people who are sleeping on the streets with no income whatsoever?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That has nothing directly to do with the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. When we sought to exempt the homeless from the "actively seeking work" provisions, I remember that the most that the Minister would say was that he would consider it—although we were certainly grateful for that. I agree with my hon. Friend that the matter raises questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that he had the impression that the Opposition believe that a definition of incapacity for work should last forever. Of course we do not believe that. In order to make our observations sound absurd, he spoke about temporary incapacity. The Minister, and most of the Committee members, know perfectly well that it is not merely a question of temporary incapacity. The question is not whether someone is temporarily incapacitated but whether his incapacity may be judged to be sufficiently severe to render him incapable for work. That judgment can change even though a substantial degree of incapacity may remain. That is why the Opposition are concerned about how the Bill will affect people who have some disability or incapacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the main point of the amendments. We may all agree about someone who should be available for work and actively seeking work—although we disagree about whether a formal test needs to be applied. The amendments are not concerned with doubts that may arise about whether such a person is satisfying the tests envisaged and whether he or she should lose the right to unemployment benefit or income support. They are concerned with the innocent parties—the families of claimants who might be ruled to be denied benefit and income support. Will those, people be punished?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>557</span>
Let us accept the worst scenario—the Government's rationale for the Bill—where a breadwinner, whatever sex that person might be, is by the Government's standards a somewhat feckless person and is not able or prepared to satisfy whatever test of actively seeking work is devised. Under the clause, the family of that feckless person would be punished by running the risk of being deprived of benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because that is so serious a matter, the onus should be on the Department to make a clear judgment on whether and why such a family should be deprived of income. The onus should not be on the person whom the Minister has described as feckless. The Bill is all about inadequate parents who are not prepared, without the encouragement of the Bill, to give sufficient expression to the concern that they should feel for those dependent on them. Yet it is on such people—who in the Government's judgment are feckless and incapable of looking after their families—that the onus is to be placed. We should place some information on the record, in the context of the onus that should be on the Department, the Department's knowledge and the assurances that we believe the Minister owes the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that one of the principal welfare rights officers for a major county who listened to the debate has told my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West that he has never heard of a hardship provision, so widely is regulation 8(3) of the income support regulations known. Despite that, the Government are prepared to place the onus not on welfare rights officers or officials of the Department but on claimants who, in their judgment, are not very good at looking after their family's interests and would not know whether the family should retain the right to income support. The least the Minister should do is tell the Committee that he will issue instructions to the Department's officers that the question of income being paid on hardship grounds should be considered before income support is removed. If he cannot do that, at least we will know where we stand, in this Committee at least.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) had considerable fun, with the help of the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn), criticising the quality of service that the Department of Health and Social Security delivers to people who need help. I hope that he was not criticising unduly staff, who work immensely hard as dedicated people, to do their best for those who need help.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not criticising individual members of staff at the offices with which I deal. I have the highest regard and respect for them and their work. What I say—this is in the Minister's court—is that the conditions under which they have to work are often extremely bad. Morale is low and under-staffing which is the result of non-appointment
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
and non-replacement of staff—or at least has been since my local offices were threatened with closure— is a major cause of dissatisfaction on both sides of the counter. The Minister knows that not only is the claimant dissatisfied but, unfortunately, so are the staff, and that dissatisfaction is levelled against his Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me point out that I made flattering references to the staff at my own local office and, in spite of the letter that I received on Tuesday—a significant day for a Conservative lady member of the Committee—I reiterate that my only two marriages so far have been to women who were employed by the DHSS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not ask about the circumstances in which the first encounter took place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to have the assurances of the hon. Members for Islington, North and for Newport, West that they recognise the tremendous efforts that staff make towards meeting claimants' needs. I am conscious of the fact that we need to improve the service, and a great deal of money and effort will go towards that. The situation is not helped by some of the scare stories of widespread closures of offices in London. We shall move jobs out of London. We have already announced that some will go to Belfast, Glasgow and Wigan and no doubt we shall move other jobs out of London eventually. The face-to-face service that the Department aims to give to claimants will still be delivered, and more effectively, accurately and speedily as a result of the changes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is not surprised that I intervene. Members of Parliament representing London constituencies are most concerned about the changes and closures. Perhaps we ought to put on record exactly what we think about them. We are not against the general transfer of central Civil Service jobs out of London to regional places. We understand the possibility of central jobs being done outside London. What we are against, as I think the Minister knows, is the closure of local offices, the transfer of shop front provisions and the lack of back-up staff in those shop fronts to handle local queries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We already have experiences of the on-line dealing with pension and child benefit problems in offices well away from our local community, and the closure of the Archway tower offices in my constituency and its replacement by two shop fronts has exacerbated those difficulties for the many local claimants. We want an efficient local service so that people may have local decisions. That is not the same as saying that we are opposed to the transfer of regional and central Civil Service jobs to areas of high unemployment. That we are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. In replying to that point, I hope that the Minister will be very brief, as it has absolutely nothing to do with the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I was about to say, I am sure that we do not want to turn this into a debate on the operational strategy and how we will deliver that

	<span class='label label-info column'>559</span>
better service, but I reiterate our commitment to achieve that as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) asked whether we have evidence of the number of cases that are decided on the day under the hardship provisions. We shall be collecting those figures in future. We have not collected them in the past, so I can say only that my advice from people experienced in the matter is that my earlier assertion to the Committee can be justified. We gave instructions to staff last summer that they should take account of hardship when considering these matters. I do not have those instructions available immediately, but I shall look at them and see whether we need to take any further steps to ensure that when disqualification is being considered, hardship is specifically discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other point I touch on is the one about Admiral Byng. It was Voltaire who said that the English shoot an admiral at intervals to encourage the others. Admiral Byng's fault was that he was not actively seeking battle. The sanction may be pretty severe. Perhaps a 40 per cent. reduction of his admiral's salary might have been a more appropriate gesture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that Admiral Byng's case is even more appropriate, because as I recall, there was some doubt about whether he was actively seeking battle. The admiral contested it and there is a fairly widespread view that his contesting it was justified and that on appeal he would have won, and the decision would have been overturned. That, of course, was of as little use to Admiral Byng as it often is to claimants in the Department of Health and Social Security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Minister has agreed at least to look again at the instructions given to the Department as to how it should handle hardship cases, but we are discussing not the regulations, which we do not, and will not, have before us, not the guidance given or the extent to which that is observed, but the Bill, We still believe that the Bill will be extremely harsh in its effect and needs to be mitigated by our amendments, so I advise my hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not need help or guidance. I am drawing the Committee's attention to the meaning of amendment No. 116. When I say "benign" I am using a sort of newspeak. I found "newspeak" on a note from my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), who would have moved the amendment if I had not arrived in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would apply to someone found guilty of not actively seeking work—that is, the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0333">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
person on holiday in a caravan by the beach at Porthcawl who has not applied for the job of Director-General of the BBC. The effect of an adjudication officer's decision to remove a claimant's benefit or income support during that period is disastrous for a claimant and doubly disastrous for his or her dependants or family. The amendment would mitigate the effects of such a decision. A claimant's income support would be reduced to 40 per cent. of the single person's rate, which would be a reduction of £13.95 a week on 1988–89 figures, so claimants would not lose income support completely. Reducing the penalty in this way would not make the actively seeking work test acceptable, but it would mitigate its disastrous consequences for claimants and their families. It would also avoid irrational differences in penalties imposed for similar offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want it thought that, because we have tabled the amendment, we approve this aspect of the Bill. We do not, but the amendment makes a reasonable proposal that even Conservative Members could accept. Certainly the benign Minister, or the benign Under-Secretary, could accept the amendment as a provision to protect claimants' dependants and families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under clause 10, people who failed the actively seeking work test would be left with no income with which to clothe and feed themselves until they could persuade an adjudication officer that they were suffering hardship. At best, they would receive income support subject to a 40 per cent. deduction, but only a small majority are likely to get even that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said earlier—I hope that he meant it seriously; I took him seriously—that the basis of income should be an individual's ability to provide a roof over his head, clothes for his body, food for himself and food and clothes for his family—in other words, the basic living requirements for a human being. We understand and accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By giving the adjudication officer these enormous powers, we are going back to the awful days of the 1930s when the predecessors of adjudication officers were given powers under the means test to decide whether there was sufficient furniture in a house or whether a family heirloom, such as a small piece of jewellery or ring, could be pawned to provide a small amount of income on which a family could live rather than claim national assistance. The legislation returns to the principle that a local adjudication officer has the power to remove income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not like the concept of someone who has been unemployed for a considerable time being subject to a whimsical decision by an adjudication officer that he has not sought work. He will have to appeal against that decision, which could take a long time because there is no effective appeal procedure. Appeals can be made only by argument. I suspect— Conservative Members should think about this— that many appeals will end up in the surgeries and on the doorsteps of Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of Parliament are already being approached by people asking them to obtain speedy
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
decisions about restart interviews. Income support claimants who have lost benefit because it is claimed that they are not actively seeking work will come to Members of Parliament to obtain a speedy decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment ensures that people will receive some income to keep themselves and their families together while they argue the toss about whether they were actively seeking work during the period to which the adjudication officer's decision applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The penalty is totally disproportionate. A family with two children under 11 would be fined £50.40 a week if they lost all income support. The penalty will nearly always be applied for at least two weeks, which represents a minimum fine—in effect it is a fine—of £100 for a first offence. That fine is imposed on a family already living on the breadline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know how much contact the Minister or Conservative Members have with the long-term unemployed, but tragically those people have not necessarily become unemployed having lost lucrative jobs. We are talking not about the plight of former Members of Parliament and so on but for example, about people who had badly paid jobs in the clothing industry. There is a big clothing industry in my constituency, which is mostly made up of small employers. Often the working conditions are disgraceful and pay is appalling. Because of the seasonal nature of the clothing industry demand cycles, people often become unemployed in the spring after the Christmas rush and for other reasons during the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many unemployed people who may be accused of not actively seeking work have had low-paid jobs. A family of such a claimant, with supplementary benefit of £50.40 a week, could be fined £100 for two weeks because the claimant is not available to seek work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister advanced many arguments about it being the responsibility of the unemployed to apply for jobs week after week whether they stand a chance of getting one or not, and has introduced a disproportionate penalty. Unemployed people will be under constant pressure to apply for jobs that they have no possibility of getting, requiring skills that they do not have and for pay that they are unlikely to be able to live on. The Bill will encourage more and more ludicrous job applications, making companies even more reluctant than they are now to acknowledge receipt of applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that the Minister is aware of that. An earlier amendment suggested that employers be required to acknowledge receipt of all applications. I understand that it would be difficult to impose a regulation insisting that every employer must reply to every applicant who writes for a job on speculation, partly because of the difficulty in policing such a regulation. However, it will be difficult to insist that people produce evidence that they are actively seeking work when many employers do not acknowledge receipt of applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that only small companies did not acknowledge receipt of applications, but since our debate I have spoken to many long-term unemployed. One of them lost his job as a bus driver with London Regional Transport through sickness.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0334">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
He has tried hard to get another job, but a middle-aged man whose previous job was bus-driving and who can no longer do it for health reasons has difficulty finding a job. He has applied for many jobs, some of which were with local authorities and even they have not always acknowledged receipt of his letters. So not only small, fly-by-night employers but large, reputable organisations or companies do not always acknowledge receipt of applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The penalty that the clause imposes is serious. I understood that to levy a penalty on somebody had to be done by due process of law. If someone commits a misdemeanour, he is not guilty until he is proved to be so in a court of law, even if he admits his guilt. At no time during that process can the police decide that he is guilty. Yet under the Bill, a quite junior civil servant—I do not cast aspersions on the character or professional responsibility of individual civil servants—can decide that a person is guilty of not applying himself adequately to seeking work during a particular period. The claimant can then lose benefit and be fined £100.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems unjust and we should think carefully before handing a judicial power to a civil servant. I do not always wish to discuss legal aspects as that can sometimes be a clumsy way of proceeding, but there must be a better way to deal with the issue than this sledgehammer approach, which will cause numerous problems. The inadequate social security appeals system will be put under great stress and, as I said earlier, people will have to rely on representations by Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will allow people to be fined on the whim of a junior civil servant, who will, I hope, have obtained proper evidence before making a judgment. The amendment would not entirely remove that power—I wish that it would—but would reduce the fine to £13.95 a week and give some protection to the claimant's dependants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second advantage of the amendment can be illustrated by the following examples. Let us suppose that a man gives up a good job with a reasonable income of £7,500 or £8,000 a year, for no reason. He immediately claims unemployment benefit and is told that he will be disqualified for 26 weeks. If he has no other source of income he will not be allowed to starve but will receive income support, subject to a 40 per cent. deduction. If, a week or two later, he is offered another equally good job and refuses to take it—again with no good reason—he will remain disqualified for unemployment benefit by the disqualification will recommence from the date of his refusal. However, he will still be entitled to income support less 40 per cent. unless the adjudication officer decides that his conduct is such that he can no longer be regarded as available for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone has been unemployed for a short time and refuses a job, it would be reasonable to consider that he or she should look for something else or that the job that had been offered was not suitable. Only at that point could income support be cut off, leaving the person with 60 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us compare that case with a man who has an exemplary work record, and who becomes unemployed in his 50s through no fault of his own,
	<span class='label label-info column'>564</span>
like the bus driver whom I mentioned. Such a person, may have been made redundant because of factory closure or may have lost his job for some other reason. After faithfully fulfilling the requirements of the "actively seeking employment" test for six months, he takes his family away for two weeks' holiday in a friend's seaside caravan. That would be perfectly normal—people in my area may go to Canvey island or Southend for a couple of weeks' holiday, where many people own caravans or chalets and let them to friends who are hard up and need a break.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, during that break with his family and children, the man is available for work. He is not moonlighting or working on the cross-Channel ferries. However, on his return the adjudication officer says that he was away for two weeks when he could have been actively seeking work. He is then fined, in accordance with the provision, and loses £100 for the period in which he was not actively seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has not the Minister already explained that if the claimant is writing letters and reading advertisements in the daily newspapers while he is on holiday, he will be all right?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The claimant might be all right if he spends his holiday reading papers and writing letters. However, he may have taken his holiday not in a seaside town but in place where he cannot easily buy daily newspapers. It would not be unreasonable to suggest that he may have gone abroad. Moreover, he is unlikely to be able to telephone or receive letters about jobs for which he has applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus the person who has behaved much less responsibly can draw income support for seven weeks before the penalty is imposed, whereas the person in a more difficult position is penalised. That is illogical and illustrates one of the problems that the clause highlights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be not only indefensible differences in the penalties for different offences, but cases where a single offence attracts a double penalty. Last week I drew attention to the case of a claimant who was caught by section 20(1)(d) of the Social Security Act 1975, which disqualifies from unemployment benefit people who have, without good cause, refused or failed to carry out any official recommendation given with a view to assisting them to find suitable employment. They will then be disqualified from unemployment benefit and their income support will be reduced by 40 per cent. for 26 weeks. But they will also be told that they are not actively seeking employment and are therefore not entitled to any income support, at least until they repent and agree to carry out whatever recommendation has been given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we asked the Under-Secretary to defend that double penalty—double jeopardy is the legal term— he accepted that he had made quite an important point and agreed to consider it further. I am expecting a letter from him on that. Will he consider again the inconsistencies implicit in the drafting of the Bill in the way that these penalties can be imposed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 117 raises again—this time in the context of income support—the question of whether benefit should be cut off on suspicion of not actively seeking work or should continue until a formal decision has been made by the adjudication officer. We debated that under clause 7, following the Minister's notorious letter of 23 January in which he explained that, contrary to what was said in the original notes on clause 7, unemployment benefit would be cut off as soon as a doubt about actively seeking work arose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department seems to be in some confusion here. Does it intend that benefit should be cut off as soon as the suspicion of not actively seeking work arises or after that person has had an oportunity to question the view being taken by the officer making the allegation? In the light of the change of policy, it is all the more important that income support payments should continue in all cases so that if a person loses unemployment benefit he should get income support in all cases—not just where he can prove hardship—until the adjudication officer has made his decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 117 would produce that result. It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a person shall be treated as actively seeking employment where a doubt has arisen as to his actively seeking employment but it has not been determined by an adjudication officer that he is not actively seeking employment."</p></blockquote>
The Minister's defence of the policy announced in his letter of 23 January rested on one crucial assumption—that the claimant was guilty. His letter stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the claimant fails to take the action which the Employment Service staff recommended at the start of his claim that he should, the issue will again be discussed with him. They will go over with him what courses of action might be fruitful, given the state of the local job market and his personal situation, reminding him of the need to satisfy the 'actively seeking employment' test if he is to continue to receive benefit… Only if, after that, the claimant continues to fail to take such action will his benefit be stopped, and the adjudication officer asked for a decision."</p></blockquote>
The principle that a man must be guilty of an offence because he has been warned of the consequences of committing it is extremely odd, and has no place in the criminal law of this country. I was going to add or in any other country either but I can think of quite a few countries where it might. I have some knowledge of Paraguay. I have never visited Haiti but I understand that similar provisions might well apply there. I hope that it would not apply in this country, which is supposed to pride itself on a system of justice that judges a person to be innocent until proven guilty. I can see enormous holes in that argument as, like my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short), I spend much of my time dealing with the immigration service, which does not seem to understand the principles of Roman law, or any other law. Immigration officers find everyone guilty until we have convinced them of their innocence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister assures us that there is no risk of injustice in cutting off a person's benefit before he has been found guilty of not actively seeking
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
employment, because he has been warned of the consequences. That is an extremely strange notion of the law. I pointed out the problem earlier, Mr. Winterton, that you or I might be found guilty of some terrible offence or misdemeanour tonight—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or at lunchtime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I probably will not leave the building then if that is the case. We are aware of what the law is. We know that it is illegal to go down the street and smash windows and assault someone. We know that it is illegal to carry firearms without a licence. There are many offences that we have been warned about. That does not mean that as soon as a police officer arrests us or charges us with an offence we are guilty merely because we have been warned that that action is illegal.

An important principle of law is that one is innocent until proven guilty. These regulations assume the person to be guilty of not actively seeking work on the say-so of that officer at that time and the penalty is imposed immediately. Never mind that it might be possible at a later stage to redress the injustice and get that benefit back—I say might because I suspect that it will be a long and tortuous process—that person will be fined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Applied to the civil or criminal law, a person charged would be fined immediately and would have to prove his innocence and might get the fine and costs back if he did so. That is not justice and it should not apply in social security legislation either, because the people affected are often very hard up and vulnerable. The Government are obsessed with insisting that everyone is actively seeking work when the vast majority of unemployed people are actively seeking work anyway. We have been through plenty of statistics in Committee about unemployment levels in all parts of the country. In no part of the country, with the possible exception of some market towns in the south of England, is the number of vacancies advertised or registered greater than the number of people who are unemployed. If there were 1,000 job vacancies and 1,000 people registered in a town it would assume a total match of skills and abilities which I suspect would never happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in periods of low unemployment it should still be understood that just because there are job vacancies, they cannot automatically be filled by all the people who are unemployed. It would be ludicrous to expect a computer operator to act as a mainline pipe welder and vice versa. Some regard must be paid to the available skills and abilities. The Minister must be aware of that. I suspect that the real thinking behind the Bill comes not from him or the Under-Secretary but from the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) and others who are obsessed with reducing unemployment figures at the expense of any logic, truth or justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most claimants whose cases are referred to an adjudication officer to be judged on the criterion of availability for work are found not guilty of the offence of being unavailable for work. We do not know what proportion will be found not guilty in actively seeking employment cases, but some undoubtedly will. It cannot be right that they should be deprived not only of unemployment benefit but even of income support while the matter is being investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments will not cost a great deal of money, but will remove the fear of great hardship that would befall the dependants and children of those who have been adjudged to be not actively seeking work. We are trying to mitigate the consequences of a particularly badly drafted part of the Bill. I hope that the Minister will understand that and give us some hope for the dependants of unemployed people so that they do not suffer even if an illogical decision is made about the breadwinner of the family.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply briefly because much of the ground covered has already been covered in debates on earlier amendments. The hon. Member for Islington, North will not like the analogy but he used a technique of which Enoch Powell was very fond. He built a remorselessly logical argument which was fatally flawed as it was based on a false premise. I do not accept that any analogy can be drawn between the concepts of guilt, fines, penalties that are appropriate to the criminal law with what happens in these circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Benefits are made available on certain conditions. To get a benefit, a person has to fulfill certain conditions. Taxpayers have a right to expect that those who have custody of their money see that benefits are paid only if those conditions are satisfied. We are asking officials to decide whether a person satisfies the condition of "actively seeking work". If he cannot satisfy that condition, the Department of Social Security has a responsibility to see that the taxpayers' money is not spent on him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Islington, North said, the proposal in amendment No. 116 would replace the provision dealing with the voluntary unemployment deduction, which applies where someone does not satisfy the "actively seeking work" test. Where somebody can satisfy the adjudication officer that he is actively seeking work, there is no question of any reduction. If he is disqualified from income support, he would, as I explained when we debated a previous amendment, have to satisfy the office's section supervisor that he would suffer hardship. I have already explained the criteria for judging hardship. It is worth placing on record that the reduction will be 40 per cent. of the claimant's personal allowance. There is no reduction of any payments that may be made to dependants. If the claimant satisfies various other conditions—if someone in the household is seriously ill, for example—the deduction might be only 20 per cent. The Committee should be clear about the nature and scope of such a deduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
It is still appropriate that people who fail to satisfy the "actively seeking work" test should have their income support withdrawn for the week or weeks in question. They can, of course, requalify for benefit when they claim again, if they have taken the appropriate steps and satisfied the Department that they are actively seeking work. That is the appropriate way forward, and I cannot accept amendment No. 116. Nor can I accept amendment No. 117, which takes us back on to familiar ground. I hope that the hon. Member for Islington, North will not think me discourteous if I deal with the amendment very quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the hon. Gentleman is saying, as we heard in the debate on clause 7, that someone should be deemed to be still actively seeking work until a decision has been made and should not suffer disqualification before then. The hon. Gentleman read out the various steps that will be taken by the employment service—the initial interview, the possible subsequent interviews and finally the "warning" that the claimant will have to be seen to have taken appropriate steps when he comes back to claim benefit another time. That process will be carried out step by step. The claimant will have explained to him quite clearly the steps that he will be expected to take if he is to satisfy the condition. Only if he then comes back without having taken those steps, will he be judged not to be actively seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps repeating this assurance, but he is wrong. The new framework of the law will require people to seek work actively on a weekly basis. They will be disqualified from benefit in the second week if they actively sought work only in the first week. Therefore, there cannot be a cumulative process of warning, as the requirements are imposed on a weekly basis. The Minister keeps giving us that assurance, but he is not in a position to do so unless the law is to be breached.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are saying that the process will be gone through, because when someone is disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit, officials in the employment service will wish to satisfy themselves that that person is clearly not actively seeking work. That is why he will be given guidance. He may feel initially that he has taken active steps, in which case it is for the officer to tell him what he needs to do to satisfy the condition. If he does not do those things, the officer will come to the conclusion that he has no intention of actively seeking work. I assure the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) that that is how it will work in practice.

The Minister's point is about whether someone is actively seeking work. In an ideal relationship, the local unemployment office would be understanding of claimants' circumstances and supportive of their desire to seek work. The officers would attempt to encourage claimants and help them to find suitable jobs. That ideal relationship probably exists in plenty of places. However, there are few difficulties. First, the Government put enormous pressure on local employment offices to get the figures down. That is done by changing the system of counting, and putting pressure on officers to encourage claimants into work. Many offices are under great pressure to check that claimants are actively seeking work because if they are judged not to be actively seeking work, they will not appear on the unemployment register. Secondly, there is the right of appeal against decisions made by officials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his speech on an earlier amendment, the Minister talked about the right of people to the basic necessities of life and my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) and I picked him up on that point. It is fair enough that people should have a right to the basic necessities. In that sense, I do not see unemployment benefit and income support as a contract between a person and the state. It is the state's responsibility to ensure that people have the basic requirements of life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that the dependants of the unemployed person would have the basic requirements of life and that the right of an adjudication officer to find someone guilty until he can prove himself innocent would be slightly mitigated. I would be happier if there were a better form of appeal and redress against the decisions of officials than appears to be the case as the Bill is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister understands that there is a philosophical difference between us on many points, but I am that he will also understand that the amendment will help the dependants of claimants. This is a perfectly reasonable amendment, and accepting it would be like a little chink of light coming through what will be a bleak prospect for unemployed and poor people if the Bill becomes law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments, particularly amendment No. 119, delete the five lines that give the Secretary of State the power to make regulations for income support purposees on
	<br><blockquote><p>"matters which may be taken into account in determining whether a person does or does not have good cause for conduct of any … king"</p></blockquote>
giving grounds for disqualification for unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not clear why such regulations are necessary. The 40 per cent. reduction in income support applies to anyone who is disqualified for unemployment benefit or would be disqualified if he or she claimed, or if his or her claim has not been disallowed for other reasons. In all those cases, the adjudication officer must decide whether the claimant is or would be disqualified for unemployment benefit. In making that decision, the adjudication officer will in future have to decide for the purposes of unemployment benefit whether the claimant had good cause for acting or failing to act as he or she did. It is not clear to Opposition Members why the officer should need to decide that question again for the purposes of income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be said that the answer lies in what is considered to be a good cause. Will a good cause for unemployment benefit purposes be different from a good cause for income support purposes? That does not appear to be the intention since the notes on clauses state that the income support regulations to be made under clause 10 will "mirror" the unemployment benefit regulations made under clause 9. I raised that point in the debate on the last group of amendments on good cause and asked the Minister to look into it. I apologise if he answered clearly, but we have not had time to read the record of the previous sitting. There seemed to be discrepancy between clauses 9 and 10, and it adds to the mystery that the regulating powers in clauses 9 and 10 seem to be different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain more clearly why it is necessary to have two lots of regulations? Where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0338">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>571</span>
there are differences between them, what are the differences? It is confusing to us. If a decision has been made to disqualify someone from unemployment benefit, what is the difference between the conditions allowing that to happen and those affecting that person for the purposes of income support?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to stray too far but when we argue about what is a good cause or a dodgy cause, circumstances will always make a tremendous amount of difference. Flexibility is essential for both unemployment benefit and income support. We still do not know whether conditions of unemployment will be a good or a bad cause. I said in a previous debate that in some cases it may be a matter of judgment whether a person has refused a job for reasons of remuneration or conditions. When I asked whether employers were fit to employ people for dangerous work, particularly young and inexperienced people, I was rebuked by the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman). She said that it was silly to suggest that employers would put their employees in any danger. It is difficult to believe that someone living in the real world thinks like that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most hon. Members have had the chance to read the press reports this morning about the inquiry into the unfortunate YTS girl who dies in an horrific accident, in which she became virtually a fireball. She was nearly 18 and worked in a factory using acetone. A considerable amount was spilled on the floor. When I worked in industry, the immediate action would have been to evacuate the building. In this case, the 17 and 18 year old trainees stood in the acetone mopping it up. They called for the machines to be switched off. A spark came and one girl went up in a ball of flames. That highlights our worries about just cause. If I were a parent and my son or daughter was sent to such a job in such a factory— where the supervisor himself was only 21 years old— I should say to my son or daughter, "No way are you going to work in those conditions." Is that good cause? Does it take a nasty accident to prove that our arguments are neither silly or flippant, but serious?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the benefit of the hon. Member for Billericay, that accident was not a one-off. Time and again such accidents happen. Last year eight young people died because of accidents such as falling off ladders or explosions in garage paint shops. Experienced people expect those risks in dangerous occupations, and are trained. When I was a shop steward there were certain parts of the factory in which apprentices were not allowed for three years or longer, even though they received proper training. Such arrangements were not restrictive practices, but were established for obvious reasons. Inexperienced people can be a liability not only to themselves, but to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Working conditions should be a good cause and the fact that they are not worries us greatly. I am glad to have placed our arguments about that on the record. I hope that the Minister will pass that message down when regulations are finally drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Tuesday, the Minister said that low pay would not be ruled out as good cause for refusing a privately advertised job, although it would if the job were notified at the jobcentre. We are not sure how that
	<span class='label label-info column'>572</span>
will work. Would a person be expected to accept any job, however low paid, if the employer had notified the vacancy at the jobcentre? Before accepting notification of a vacancy, will jobcentres ensure that wages are reasonable? The thinking behind the Minister's reply is the naive belief that jobs notified in jobcentres will at least be protected on pay, and I hope, in the light of our arguments on conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be ludicrous if a person who turned down a job advertised privately because the pay was inadequate did not have their benefit stopped when someone turning down a job advertised through a jobcentre for the same reason did. How would someone know whether the job had been advertised in a jobcentre? He could find at his next interview that he would lose benefit because the job had been advertised at a jobcentre. That problem has not been fully explained. I cannot understand why someone who applies for a job through the jobcentre will be penalised, whereas another person who applies through the private sector will be considered to have just cause for refusing a job on grounds of remuneration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's intentions are unclear. Clause 9 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to any such regulations, in determining … whether a person does or does not have good cause for any act or omission, there shall be disregarded any matter relating to the level of remuneration in the employment in question."</p></blockquote>
Does "the level of remuneration" mean the gross wages or net earnings? If it is the latter, how will they be defined?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 9 February, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Travel expenses and child care arrangements are complicated matters, and travelling costs could absorb an unduly high proportion of the wage. However, it would not be possible to give a precise figure, and certainly not possible to write it into regulations. It would vary according to the wage that was being paid, and what was left over for other purposes. I expect to see the adjudication officers and the employment service in general considering such problems with sympathy where low-paid jobs were involved."</p></blockquote>
That gives some indication that the Government will be sympathetic. When pressed, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no straightforward answer, as I tried to explain. The employment service will decide whether good cause for not taking employment is its impact on domestic arrangements or undue travelling time. All such factors will be taken into account when determining whether there is good cause."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 9 February 1989; c. 406–408.]</p></blockquote>
That time, the Minister carefully avoided mentioning travel costs and concentrated instead on travel time. The same happened on Tuesday morning, when the Minister said that the regulations on good cause would provide for cases where the journey to work was more than one hour, but failed to say whether the cost of the journey would be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If travelling and other work expenses are not taken into account, someone may find themselves being expected to take a job in which the expenses would absorb a large proportion of the wage. It is difficult to see how expenses can be taken into account without also taking account of wage levels, and that is precisely what clause 9 says cannot be done. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0339">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
brings us back to the anomaly of clause 9 and some of the Minister's answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 120 seeks to clarify the position of entitlement to income by saying that work expenses should be taken into account. If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, he should at least give a straight answer to whether travelling and other work expenses will be taken into account in deciding whether a person has good cause for rejecting a job. If so, will that happen in all cases or only some casees?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall continue to press the Minister until he makes absolutely clear what he intends to do with the regulations. They will be part of our statutes, so it is important to get them right to avoid anomalies, tragedies, problems and worries in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton.

It states clearly that there is no intention to use the regulation-making power to have minimum control of wages. It is a breach of privilege, Mr. Winterton. It is also clearer than the assurances that we have been given in Committee and makes nonsense of our proceedings. The Minister may suggest that he has not seen it. I should like you to investigate it as a matter of privilege.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply first to the amendment and perhaps in the course of my remarks, which I may not conclude before 1 o'clock, I shall be able to deal with the point that the hon. Lady has raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We spent a considerable amount of time debating "good cause" in our consideration of clause 9. Amendment No. 119 relates to the application of that to income support. I said that in removing the concept of "suitable" employment from legislation we have placed the onus on claimants to show that they have "good cause" for turning down employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final form of the unemployment benefit regulations is, of course, still under consideration. We have in mind, though, that while we shall not attempt to provide an exhaustive list, the regulations on "good cause" should broadly reflect the existing guidance by which adjudication officers work. Adjudication authorities would continue to have considerable discretion. We intend that the regulations will specifically mention matters such as domestic circumstances, religious or conscientious objections, travel to work and work that would be seriously harmful to the health of the claimant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) pressed me on the point that I made about offers of jobs in the private sector and how they would stand in relation to "good cause". I shall go no further than I did on clause 9 and say that I am not sure how we might be able to provide for that in regulations. I explained my aim in dealing with that matter, and I should not want to go further than that at this juncture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obviously our intention that it will continue to be the case that a person who satisfies the adjudication officer that he has "good cause" will suffer neither disqualification for unemployment benefit nor income support sanctions. I am grateful to the Opposition for having tabled the amendment, because it caused me to ponder on why we need a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0340">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
regulation-making power for income support only when someone was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit might they suffer a reduction in their income support. I think the best thing I can do is to say that I am convinced by the arguments advanced by the hon. Gentleman and recommend the Committee to accept amendment No. 119. I am not being satanic or devious in saying that that means that amendment No. 120 will fall, because there will not be a line 37. However, as there must be a possibility that the Committee will not take my advice, I should like to say a word or two about amendment No. 120 because the Committee will have to come to a decision in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of that amendment is to provide express power in primary legislation for work-related expenses to be taken into account by the adjudication authorities in determining whether, for income support purposes, a claimant has "good cause" for refusing to accept or seek an opportunity of employment. The power to make regulations in relation to "good cause" matters for income support purposes only is removed by amendment No. 119, so the amendment is not appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is, in any case, unnecessary, because the regulations which will deal with good cause in the context of unemployment benefit—and its consequences—will not provide an exhaustive list of relevant matters. Power will be there for the adjudication authorities to consider a range of issues. Some of them may be mentioned, but they will be able to take other matters into account. They will certainly take account of necessary work-related expenses where they believe that that is appropriate. It is important that the Committee recognises that there are various kinds of working expenses such as fares to and from work, child-minding expenses, tools and working clothes. In considering whether to suggest a particular vacancy to any claimant, employment office staff would have regard, as they do now, to the costs the claimant would necessarily incur. They would not suggest to them that they should go after a job where the associated expenses
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
would absorb an unduly high proportion of the earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members might seek to press me to say what I regard as an unduly high proportion of earnings. It would not be possible to prescribe to in regulations what that might be, whether as a level of money or as a percentage of the wage that was being offered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
