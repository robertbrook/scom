</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Committee rose for those fleeting moments that allow us to tear around like idiots trying to catch up with all the work that we are not doing while we are in here, we discussed the number of weeks for which a person may be liable to lose benefit. Despite the Minister's assurances, which we have shown to be flawed, we had demonstrated that benefit could be lost for many weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also drew attention to the fact that, no matter what the Minister may say about the guidance that will be given, and the discussions that will take place with the person who will otherwise lose benefit, those assurances are not written into the Bill. I referred to the danger of relying on guidelines and quoted the example of immigration guidelines which appear not to bear any relation to any ordinary and rational understanding of the words written on the paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I listened to the Minister telling us how the provisions would operate, how quite junior officials, who will be given enormous discretion, will sensitively carry out their duties because of their experience and because of the training and guidance given by the Department of Employment, I was strongly reminded of examples that cast doubt on the Minister's confidence. In November, the case of a man denied payment for his board and lodgings in October came to my attention. We queried it and found that he had been denied the payment because inquiries made by officers of the Department discovered that, although the man was living as a lodger, the terms of his landlady's lease did not allow her to have a lodger. Therefore, the officials declined to pay him benefit as a lodger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know of no provision in the law, in guidelines or in advice given by any section of the social security law, which empowers officials to inquire into the circumstances of landlords who are not themselves benefit claimants. Even if such powers exist, such information has no bearing on an individual's entitlement to benefit. It may cast doubt on the wisdom of the landlord or landlady having such a claimant living in their accommodation, but that is another matter altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances under which the man lodged were of no concern whatever to the Department, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>283</span>
had nothing to do with his claim for benefit. The Department finally agreed in January and after three months of being illegally refused benefit on the basis of inquiries that were not the business of the Department, benefit was finally restored. Even that one example shows why we should be sceptical about the Minister's sweeping assurances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also reminded of the experience, over years, of the law relating to deductions or deprivation of benefit on the grounds that someone is said to have voluntarily made himself unemployed. A year ago, the social policy inspectorate surveyed the implementation of that rule. It discovered, and reported to the Government, that not only were many wrong decisions being made, but that even wrong decisions overturned on appeal were often not reported to the claimant. Even when back payment of benefit should have been made, in many cases it was not. We had a long-running dispute with the Department about how far back in its files it should be prepared to go to restore to people benefit wrongly denied. There were defects in the decision-making and appeals procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For many decades, benefit could be lost for only six weeks. That could be a substantial loss, but the six weeks was the maximum period. Since then, for no good reason, other than that the judgment changed, the Department has doubled that period, so that benefit may be lost for 13 weeks. Last year, that was doubled again to 26 weeks. When the Department doubled the period to 13 weeks, that was the maximum. It was not the period for which benefit had to be withdrawn, but the maximum period for which it was allowed to be withdrawn. Now that the period is six months, that is the maximum. However, in the early days of the doubling of the period, the vast majority of officers deciding to disqualify someone from receiving benefit disqualified for the full period, as they had when the period was six weeks. Officials took no account of the difference between disqualification for six weeks, and disqualification for nearly 6 months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Precedent does not encourage me to regard discretion by DSS officers in the same way as the Minister. I am least disposed to regard favourably the Minister's view of the sympathetic and kindly way in which DSS officers invariably exercise their judgment by an episode in my family's experience. During the war, my father's health was so damaged that he became a chronic invalid. Although he worked until I was two or three, he was mostly unemployed. After some retraining, he obtained a clerical job, but his health was such that he lost that job quite soon. Forever after he was unemployed. I feel strongly about the way that the Bill will operate because I remember vividly how much my father resented his plight, a resentment that lasted all his life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After losing the job that he held briefly, my father had to sign on again for benefit. An officer in the Department of Employment made wide inquiries into our family circumstances. My mother was a teacher in full-time work and there was no question of my family being dependent on the state, although we had every right to be. Nevertheless, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>284</span>
Department official suggested that my eldest sister, who had just decided to stay on at school to go to university, should not be allowed to do so and should leave to take up work to help support my father because she had reached the school-leaving age. Neither my father nor my family were financially solely dependent on the state.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may talk about the sympathetic and courteous treatment that one can expect to receive automatically and invariably from Department of Employment officials, but that does not strike a warm cord in my heart because of that official. His comments did not relate to the law and had no bearing on anything except that he thought that the children of unemployed people should not go to university. He had every right to hold that view, but he had no right to seek to implement it through his role in the administration of benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say—he would have every right to say—that that was a long time ago. However, as we have said before, the views of the public and, in my experience, some officers in the Department of Employment—although I would not care to suggest that they are all like that—have not substantially changed. Indeed, Conservative Members have prayed that in aid of in support of the legislation. They say that that is what the public demand and the public do not like to think that the unemployed are having a happy time. A number of stories from my childhood and my family confirm that in spades—yes, indeed. Even when they are looking at someone who is grey faced, sunken cheeked and visibly a sick man, members of the public do not like to think that unemployed people might be enjoying their unemployment in any way, shape or form and are inclined to express their view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, like all of us, will receive many complaints about the dismissive and rude way in which officials of the Department treat individuals. However, in recent years, has there not been an enormous growth in the case loads of fairly low-paid officials, a whittling away of staff numbers inevitable conflict and aggression and the staff taking the flack for the meanness of the Government? When we criticise those officials, we must remind ourselves of the conditions under which they work, the strain that that imposes, and the short-temperedness and rudeness that is generated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wholeheartedly endorse my hon. Friend's observations. They are particularly evident in many of the social security offices where there are vast spaces where there used to be members of staff and vastly increased heaps of work that people are required to do. I wholeheartedly accept that many people, working either for the Department of Employment or the Department of Social Security, seek to do their jobs as sensitively as circumstances allow but, by virtue of the burden of work placed on them, find that extremely difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as I know my hon. Friend agrees, the discretion that is placed at the disposal of people in such circumstances is extremely dangerous. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>285</span>
brings me to the final point that I wish to make on this amendment—unless the Minister says something that provokes me too much—about the length of time for which people may lose their benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the purpose of the proposed change in the law is to change people's behaviour, not to punish them. Opposition Members have consistently argued that we do not much care whether the Government mean to use the law to punish people or whether that will happen by accident. What matters to us is the effect of the law and how it will impinge on people. The debate has shown that it will be open to comparatively junior and perhaps not very experienced officials in the Department of Employment to take certain actions, should they so wish, should they be in the mood on that day, or should they have a difficult individual before them. Opposition Members do not pretend that everyone who is unemployed is nice, charming and courteous and considerate of the problems of other people. Many people who might naturally be like that find it more difficult to sustain such an approach when they are unemployed. There will be circumstances in which someone is provoked in the extreme in his dealings with some, individual over whom he is seeking to implement the provisions of the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that my hon. Friends are with me in the view that it is dangerous in the extreme to put in the hands of people in those circumstances and under that pressure the power that they will be given to deprive someone of his source of income not just for two weeks or four weeks but until they have got over their displeasure with that person and are prepared to accept that he is now satisfying the provisions. As the Minister explained it, that is the discretion that will be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of one final example. Before 1982—or thereabouts I forget the exact year—there was a system that allowed discretionary single payments. It fell into disrepute not because it was so generously exercised but because it could be so rigidly and arbitrarily exercised as a result of the discretion that it allowed to the individual. Following that, the Government introduced a substantial and elaborate system of regulating single payments which they ultimately removed and replaced with the social fund, which is worse than what we started with—but you will not wish me to go into that, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the experience of claimants, advice workers and the Government of that discretion, exercised under pressure and placing people in poverty and stress, was the experience that we fear rather than the experience of which the Government claim to be confident. The system of discretion was exercised more harshly than even the Government had perhaps intended—that was why they changed the system—and more harshly than they then thought was right. I am appalled at the thought of the potential punishment that could be inflicted, particularly on the less-than-charming claimant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 1982 discretions on single payments were so harshly put
	<span class='label label-info column'>286</span>
to people that they were discredited. Instead of the Government trying to make the system easier so that the payments became a right, they removed many of the facilities for people to get single payments for anything. Having disclosed the problems with discretion and disclosed that they were not fair, instead of making them fairer they removed some of the rights altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right and we share his reservations about the progress of the Government's decision making on the matter. We are concerned about the penalties that could be inflicted, the lack of any real evidence to support how the Minister says the law could be interpreted—what the Minister said is not what the Bill says—and the power over people's lives. That is why, although I hope and anticipate that the Minister will say a little more, I am strongly minded to advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been raised, and perhaps we should give the Minister the opportunity to answer them. We were all struck this morning by his remarkable confession that in his youth he played the part of Lady Macbeth. We have had time to reflect that the role of the accomplice—the instigator of a bloody murder committed by someone else—is admirable preparation for the role of a Minister in this Government. I was rather disappointed by his quotation. The quotation that sprang immediately to our minds was a different one. The answer to the question that we ask the Minister day after day—when will we hear about the regulations—most certainly should be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Creeps in this awful Bill from day to day.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Till the final 'Order Order' by our Winterton of discontent;</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And all our amendments have fallen wide</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Consignd to futile death. Out, out brief clause!</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>You are a tale, written by a computer,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Void of hope, void of thought, signifying nothing."</p></blockquote>
Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Winterton. I thought that I would quote that at some length as this is showbusiness day, or Equity day, and in the possibly vain hope that the agent acting for the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) might hear of it and mention my name to Sky Television.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be treading on dangerous ground.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Point noted, but not necessarily taken.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are few angelic inspirations on the Opposition Benches. We are rather more down to earth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to more mundane matters. We are not reassured by what has been said about the clause. I am sure that the bromides bestowed on us by the Minister were sincere. Despite his assurances that people will be advised, informed, warned and handed leaflets—we know from our political experience that no one ever reads leaflets—it will not work out that way. We have had the bitter experience of restart, which turned out to be a harsh test. I declare an interest here, because my wife was a Department of Social Security officer, and chairperson of the union the only time that it went on strike—something of an accolade. So I have a vested interest in the DSS, and know about the problems of the officers. They share our human weaknesses and foibles, such as malice and prejudice. They get fed up, tired and angry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was moved by what my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said about her family. I do not know how we forget what being unemployed feels like. Perhaps we do not know. When I was a councillor, one third of the male work force in my area lost their jobs over about three years. Those men had great skills in the steel industry, around which they built their lives. That was their claim to status and dignity, and suddenly it disappeared. Their lives became shapeless. They had no daily routine. They crumbled visibly as their self-esteem drained away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was sad to see those men, with tears in their eyes, applying for all kinds of jobs. I remember one man telling me that he had applied for a job cleaning out toilets at Tredegar house, in my constituency. He had great skill in his hands and eyes. As a steelmaker, he had commanded a huge salary. He was one of 38 people applying for this very menial job, and he was rejected. He had gone from being one of the aristocrats of the steel industry work force to being a man who could not get a job cleaning out toilets.

It is those men and women who will be told by boys and girls about the same age as their sons and daughters, or even their grandsons and granddaughters, not to go away on holiday. If they go away, they will be bullied and harassed and a record will be kept. Dignity—the core around which we need to build our lives—is being dragged away from them, and that turns the knife in the wound.

The amendments are modest. They ask that the unemployed are not assumed to be guilty, an assumption that has been implicit in much that has been said today. Anyone who is suspected of not actively seeking work is assumed to be guilty. As we said earlier, all the evidence is to the contrary. Over half of those questioned on their availability were found to have been falsely accused. More than three quarters of those whose partial availability was questioned were subsequently found not to have been guilty of anything, yet we are making a judgment based on the decisions of very junior officers. Extremely sophisticated decisions will be made according to the state of mind of the people involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not clarify whether the claimants whose "actively seeking work" status has been tested will receive 60 per cent, of normal minimum rate. Little has been said about the scandal of the delays in the present system which amendment No. 53 would take care of. Delays get longer. No serious attention is paid to the warnings given by the chief adjudication officer about the extension in the number of days. Perhaps the Minister can tell us the average delay between the lodging of an appeal and the tribunal. What is considered to be a realistic target? If the answer is more than 21 days, amendment No. 53 is clearly an urgent necessity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with at least some of the points that have been raised and fulfill an obligation that I made to the hon. Lady for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) who asked about commissioners' decisions. The Opposition have placed a lot of weight on RU/5/80. Since then there have been a number of unreported commissioners' decisions that have shown that a limited amount of weight can be placed on that decision. In commissioners' decision CU/11/1983 the commissioner said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are many cases in which proof of positive personal initiatives to obtain employment by private effort is a ready means of substantiating availability for employment, but the material legislation does not impose any affirmative obligation upon a claimant in this respect."</p></blockquote>
There are others, including decisions CU/18/1985 and CU/194/1986 which show that the application of the reported decision to which the Opposition have alluded more than once in our debates is extremely limited and that the "active steps" referred to in that decision actually stop short of looking for work. I cannot believe that the Opposition regard that as a satisfactory state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the level, quality and numbers of staff taking decisions. I do not for one moment pretend that the daily irritations which we all endure from time to time never flow through into the attitude of staff confronted with members of the public whether they work in the Department of Employment or the Department of Social Security. There can be instances of insolence of office and other failings. I spend much of my time visiting DSS offices and in general I am immensely impressed by the commitment, compassion and understanding shown by the staff in our offices. I am sure that the same is true of the Department of Employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) asked about numbers of staff. The employment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>289</span>
service employs some 37,000 staff. That number is expected to increase to over 40,000 by 1991–92. The numbers of those who are engaged in specialist counselling work—new claimant advisers and restart counsellors—have been steadily increasing. I gave the precise figures earlier for the increased recruitment and deployment of staff.

The executive officers, the EOs, are the first level of management within the Civil Service. The decisions that we are considering today are the sort of decisions that EOs are well used to taking in their ordinary working lives. In the early days of the implementation of this new test I expect that EOs will consult with more senior colleagues as they establish the pattern of how the test will operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister give a firm undertaking that no one below the level of EO will ever take such a decision?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the intention. I cannot say that that could never happen. There might be some totally obscure reason such as an office being affected by the plague or industrial action. Certainly it is not intended that anyone below the level of EO should deal with these cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with great care to the speeches made today. The impression given was that the decision that an individual's benefit was to cease would come like a bolt out of the blue. The reality will be very different. When the claim starts there will have been both leaflet advice and the oral advice on the particular circumstances of the individual to back it up. If worries emerge about whether people are actively seeking work they will be counselled and advised about the steps to take to fulfill that obligation at least once and perhaps more often than that. They would be advised of the danger that they were running in declining to take any notice of the advice given by the people trying to help them back into work. In those circumstancess, if they have not taken those steps and have no valid reasons for that, the fact that their benefit is withdrawn would hardly come as a surprise to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Member for Derby, South said that the benefit will be disallowed not just for two weeks but for four weeks, six weeks or a much longer period. I challenge that assumption strongly. We are dealing not with a subjective judgment about the state of mind of a claimant nor his or her attitude to availability, but with evidence. If the benefit is withdrawn, it will be because there will be no evidence to show that that person was actively seeking work. If, as a result of that shock to their system, they get out and in the following two weeks make sure that they are actively seeking work, they will not have to make a fresh claim. They will come back to sign on and will be able to produce the evidence to show that they have actively sought work. In those circumstances, there is no reason why they should not be re-entitled to benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is describing a Bill that is not before us. Under the provisions of the Bill, a
	<span class='label label-info column'>290</span>
person could look for a job seven days a week for 10 weeks and become demoralised and upset. There could be sickness in the family and he could feel low and therefore not look for a job for any day in the 11th week. Under the provisions of the Bill, He would be prevented from receiving benefit in the 11 week. When the Minister assures us that the judgment will be over a long period of time, he is describing present practice on availability. Currently, people are called in and asked to show what efforts they have made over the past weeks. The Minister tries to reassure us by describing something other than the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Bill is interpreted by regulations, it will operate in a much more reasonable way than that which the hon. Lady describes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that the smooth and easy procedure, which will cause the claimant hardly any difficulty so long as he is actively seeking work, will nevertheless cost him four weeks' benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not cost him more than two weeks' benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are four weeks between one payment and the next, but if a claimant can show an adjudication officer in the Department of Social Security that he or his family would suffer hardship as a result, he could get income support at a reduced level for the intervening period.

This is not the unreasonable, oppressive measure portrayed by the Opposition. The clause aims not to punish or penalise people but to encourage and persuade them back into employment. Both sides of the Committee believe that the vast majority of people want to be employed and will achieve great benefit from it.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 5, leave out lines 4 to 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 51, in page 5, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) After subsection (2) there shall be inserted the following subsection—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'() Regulations shall provide that if a person takes prescribed steps in any week he shall be regarded as actively seeking employed earner's employment in that week.'.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 7(3) empowers the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying the steps that a person must take in a particular week if he is to be regarded as actively seeking work. Amendment No. 49 seeks to delete that power and amendment No. 51 would substitute a requirement for the Secretary of State to make regulations specifying steps which, if taken, will automatically satisfy the "actively seeking work" test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that the Government will welcome the amendment, as the Minister keeps saying that there is no power to combat the unreasonable exercise of discretion. He has just said that the point of such a test is to have a simple, mechanical means by which people can prove that they qualify for benefit, so that no questions can arise about their state of mind or about how hard they are trying to find work. That would be the precise effect of the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the test is to be imposed, people must know what is required of them to satisfy it. Subsection (3) is one-sided, because even if the claimant takes all the steps prescribed by the Secretary of State, as the law stands an adjudication officer could still refuse to accept that the person is actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The notes on clauses say that although the regulations will list steps that could satisfy the test, they will not be exhaustive but mere examples. We are worried that the officer in the Department may say to the claimant,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Although you have taken the same steps this week as you took last week and I accepted that you were actively seeking work then, what you did last week did not result in your finding a job so you should be doing something different this week. Unless you do something different, I may cut off you benefit."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>292</span>
We have already discussed the fact that the initial decision in those circumstances may be taken by a relatively junior official, and could be taken on the flimsiest grounds. After all, who can look into the mind or heart of the official in question and decide why he has taken that decision? It is enough that he takes it and the claimant must bear its effects. That is an intolerable position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that, over two or three weeks, a claimant could be answerable to two or three different officers whose judgments will differ. That is not only unfair but must be confusing to a claimant who satisfies one officer but finds that he is judged as guilty by another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an admirable point. It had not occurred to me, but he is right. Indeed, I imagine that the chances of a claimant seeing the same officer every time cannot be high. Again, we are alarmed by the discretion that is allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 51 seeks to shift the onus on to the Secretary of State by providing that regulations must lay down the maximum requirement that someone must fulfil to be accepted as actively seeking work. Anyone who has genuinely taken all the steps specified will know that he is entitled to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect that the Minister will say that that would not be fair because, in making individual, careful, sensitive decisions, it may not always be suitable for one person to take steps that are required of another. However, that is not a valid objection because the amendment would impose a maximum test. The Minister is always saying that it does not matter what the maximum is in a Bill because discretion will be used sensitively. The amendment would still allow an adjudication officer to pass someone who had not taken all the steps, but it would limit the test that could be imposed and thereby limit the degree of discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not suggesting that the amendments would make the test one that could be administered in a fair and dignified way. However, if the amendments are not accepted there is a danger that claimants will be left in a permanent state of insecurity. People may be assumed to be guilty until they can prove that they are innocent, which is a reversal of the basic principle of British law, however acceptable that may be to our EC colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise again to disappoint the Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has told us repeatedly that this is a shift from a test of people's intentions to their objective actions. If that is so, he should be able to lay down in regulations the objective actions that people must take to comply with the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall now explain why I do not accept the hon. Lady's advice, however passionately she delivered it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debates on the clause have given the Committee a clear idea of the sort of steps that we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>293</span>
envisage. We intend to say in regulations that people should take all appropriate steps, and give some examples of what those steps are likely to be, such as, for example, contacting employers and answering advertisements. Such actions are currently taken by people actively seeking jobs. It will be helpful for Parliament to outline the sort of actions that should be taken for the guidance of claimants and the adjudication authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We certainly do not want to set out in regulations a series of steps that must be applied across the board to all claimants, regardless of their circumstances. We have already said that we need flexibility to take account of local labour markets. We must also take account of the different physical and mental capacities of claimants when we judge whether they are actively seeking work. What may be right for one claimant given his aptitudes and abilities may be inappropriate for another. I do not want to set rigid regulations to apply across the board, but to set a general target and allow flexibility in interpretation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady rightly says that the claimant needs to know what he is expected to do to satisfy the test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not explained what a person must do to prove that he is actively seeking employment when he is at a funeral out of the country or on holiday? Are the unemployed not allowed to go on holiday? Does the claimant have to write letters during a funeral to substantiate his claim?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that people are away from home for a funeral or holiday does not prevent them from searching through the newspapers for vacancies, and, if necessary, applying for those jobs. We do not want people to cut themselves off totally from their job search if they go away.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is not a stupid man. If people go from Birmingham to Cornwall for a week's holiday it is not much use their looking in the newspapers there for jobs when their homes are in Birmingham. When people are on holiday it is not possible for them to apply for jobs at home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have the benefit of a substantial network of national newspapers in this country which carry advertisements. We are not just discussing local papers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is astounding. Is the Minister saying that unemployed people on holiday are required, by the Department of Employment or the DSS, to take and read all the daily newspapers, ring all appropriate advertisements with a pen, write or phone them and get a receipt just to ensure that on return home their benefit has not been stopped for failing actively to seek work while on holiday?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seeks to reduce my point to the level of absurdity. People who are away should not totally cut themselves off from their search for work. The hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) takes us back to an earlier point
	<span class='label label-info column'>294</span>
when I explained what would be covered in the regulations. The hon. Gentleman may not have been present, but going back over that ground just because of his absence is not a proper use of Committee time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain how the regulations will affect district or regional councillors who are out of the country on council business, but are registered as unemployed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes the point that I wish to make about the amendment. To try to set out in the Bill, or in detailed regulations, the exact steps that claimants in a range of circumstances should take to satisfy the test would be ludicrous. Therefore, we intend to say that appropriate steps should be taken and give some idea of what those steps may be. Claimants need to know what is expected of them, as the hon. Member for Derby, South said. They will know what is expected of them because they will be advised, when they first make their claim and receive benefit, of the steps that they are expected to take in their circumstances, in their area, to satisfy the test. That is the most sensible, appropriate way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Rosie Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister the way that the regulations will discriminate against people who could benefit from a holiday. The Family Holiday Association provides holidays for people who are in severe need, have suffered great stress, have little means and cannot afford to pay for themselves or have a severe problem in the family, perhaps a terminal illness, threatened nervous breakdown, general ill health or depression following a long period of poverty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Family Holiday Association has raised money to pay for such holidays. The Association of British Travel Agents has now offered it access to thousands of free holidays, because each year some holidays paid for by holiday companies are not taken up. The Family Holiday Association has been told that it could allocate some of those holidays to people on its waiting list. At present, it is unable to help many people because there are too many applications for holidays. Many worthy cases are turned down. The Bill will make life even more difficult for the unemployed, rather than make it possible for unemployed people to enjoy what may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. People taking much-needed and long-overdue holidays abroad are not able actively to seek work, and they will have to go right back to square one for their benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister replies, may I request shorter interventions from the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mrs Barnes). If she wishes to make a major contribution to the debate proper, that is another matter, but her interventions should be shorter in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady's intervention illustrated vividly how ridiculous it would be to try to provide detailed regulations for every set of circumstances. Her argument covered people on income support
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>295</span>
rather than unemployment benefit, such as lone parents, who may need a break. However, lone parents with children under the age of 16 would not be required to be available for work, let alone actively seeking it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we seek to prescribe in regulations every set of circumstances in every part of the country, that will result in such complexity that claimants will be confused and baffled. The individual advice that they will receive when they sign on for benefit about the steps that they need to take to satisfy this test is a much better way of handling the situation, which I agree needs to be handled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is a little confused about this matter. Under a former Labour Government, and under many Governments before that, an unemployed person could not go on holiday because he would not be available for work. Successive Governments have recognised that if someone is willing to advise the Department of Employment where he can be contacted, and if he agrees to come back from his holiday to take up a job, they can go on holiday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. As I said in a previous debate, this is a complicated area. I have undertaken to consult my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment to ensure that the issue is handled in a flexible, sensible and fair manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) reinforces what Opposition Members are saying. This is an absurdity. We are not asking for any great change. We are not asking to go back to the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will someone who goes on holiday be kitted out with postcards from the DSS office, which he sends back saying, "Having a wonderful time in Bournemouth this week, but if you have any vacancies, I'll rush back"? We are not creating an absurdity, because the absurdity already exists. To have the oppressive duty of facing the jobcentre every week is a bizarre view of a holiday. Surely the idea of a holiday is to have a break from routine. I think that on reflection the Minister, like Opposition Members and, I am sure, the people in the public gallery, will judge this to be an onerous and unnecessary suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister complains about possible complexity, but complexity is inevitable. Having created the new rule, which we regard as unnecessary, the Government have a duty to make it just and fair. Making it just and fair will also make it complicated. The Minister is the author of those complications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised that the Minister does not know that the sort of jobs advertised in national newspapers are not the jobs that low-paid, low-skilled, long-term unemployed people obtain. If he looks at all the national newspapers on any day, he will see that the vacancies that may be advertised locally are not the kind that are advertised nationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This short debate reveals that the justification for the Government's strategy has fallen apart. They say
	<span class='label label-info column'>296</span>
that we are moving from a subjective availability for work test, which depends on people's intentions, to an objective test to establish that people are actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have asked the Minister to describe what will be in the regulations, how the provisions will apply to over 50-year-olds, what will happen to people going on holiday, and what will happen in local labour markets with high unemployment. He keeps saying that the test has to be flexible and that it will be different in various places and for various groups. But he cannot have it both ways. If it is fair to withdraw people's benefit the minute they suggest that they are not actively seeking work, the test cannot be both firm and objective. The Minister, despite his elequence and ability, is incapable of describing the test. He will not lay it down in regulations because he has so much difficulty and because he requires flexibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have simply gone round in a circle. The Minister is not justifying the move. It will not be an objective test. It will be a power that fairly low-level officials will have that they obviously will not exercise every week with every vulnerable individual. It will be haphazard. It will depend on whey they choose to pull people in. They will be able to subject people to the test and knock them off benefit or force them into a low-paid job or a rotten ET scheme whenever they feel like it. That is not a just or fair system. The Minister cannot say that it is good and fine, and that the Government simply want people to seek work actively. He knows very well that even if everyone actively sought work, there are not enough vancancies in the labour market for all the people who are unemployed. This short debate has exposed the fallacy of the claim that this is an objective test. The Minister should be ashamed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not take long but I must make a couple of comments on the debate, short though it may have been. One has to admit that the Minister of State has gall. It requires a degree of nerve that I do not possess to reply to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Greenwich (Mrs. Barnes) about how the test Will operate and people will be affected, that that shows how complicated it is and how impossible it is to set down in regulations. Perhaps a new glossary of terms should accompany every Bill from the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North pressed the Minister on how the test would be applied when people were on holiday. The Minister talked about encouraging people to seek work. I was reminded of our debate last year when the Department removed the right to benefit from 16 to 18-year-olds. We were told that they were losing not their right to benefit but the opportunity to be idle in a way that would damage their future careers. If I might paraphrase what the Minister is saying now, the Government are not necessarily going to take people's benefit away but are simply encouraging them to take the steps needed to keep their benefit which, should they lose it, would leave them with no means of support.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As it is perfectly clear in all existing regulations that it is permissible for claimants to take a holiday, does my hon. Friend know of any reason why these regulations could not simply say that none of these provisions shall apply while the person is on holiday and that that holiday shall be for, say, four weeks per year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is entirely right. We tabled an amendment, which was taken in a group this morning, that would have had that effect, but the Minister resisted it. The accurate and truthful response to the hon. Member for Greenwich would have been to say that under the Bill at present, ABTA and the Family Holiday Association may as well tear up their plans. People will be told not that they cannot take holidays, but that if they do, they will lose their income, all in the name of encouraging them to find work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disturbed by the idea that I may be becoming psychic or attuned to the arguments that the Minister is likely to use. He said that the amendment could not be accepted because of all the different steps that might be appropriate to different individuals. Yet, when I moved the amendment I pointed out that our amendment sets out steps that will lead to the maximum qualifications that can be imposed. If someone can prove that they have satisfied all those steps, no residual power will remain to withdraw their benefit. That is not the same as saying that there cannot be steps below that. That is clearly why we stated that that would be a maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, some objective level of commitment and of test satisfaction should be on the record. People could thus say that they have ticked all the boxes and done all those things and that therefore no residual right remains to withdraw their benefits. That was the matter which our amendment sought to rectify. It is irrelevant for the Minister to refer to all the different treatments required for different cases. The amendment would not preclude different treatments for different cases. It would preclude some absurd maxim of treatment which was not merely different for different individuals but such that no one could possibly satisfy it, no matter how hard he or she tried, and which was totally unrelated to their circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood said, this is not an objective test and it has nothing to do with encouraging people into work. It simply provides arbitrary powers to be exercised over the lives of people who are unemployed. They have quite enough to put up with already. It is a matter to which we might wish to return later. Nevertheless, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 71, in page 5, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) After subsection (2) there shall be inserted the following subsection—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'() Regulations shall provide that if a person has been or has been deemed to be actively seeking employment and is no longer actively seeking or deemed to be actively seeking employment, he shall be so deemed unless he has received written advice from a
	<span class='label label-info column'>298</span>
duly authorised person as to the steps he is required to take if he is to be regarded as actively seeking employment and not less than one week's written notice, given by a duly authorised person, of the consequences of failure to take such steps and has nevertheless failed to take such steps'.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deserves inclusion in the Bill for its literary merit alone. The Minister will find that and our arguments irresistible. It is an amendment of such vivid clarity and simplicity that I was tempted to chant it rather than read it. The Opposition are still not convinced by the defence on the change of policy set out in the now infamous letter of 23 January to members of the Committee. Before claimants' benefit is withdrawn on the grounds that they are not actively seeking work, they will have been advised of the steps that they are required to take and warned of the consequences of not taking steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difference is between the dream and the reality. As T.S. Eliot wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Between the idea</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And the reality</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Between the motion</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And the act</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Falls the Shadow."</p></blockquote>
The shadow falls between what we have heard repeatedly and the bitter reality of how the Bill will be implemented in DSS offices. There will be confusions, mix-ups and delays. The dream is fine, the reality is less impressive. Our anxieties spring mainly from those experiences and our conviction that, whatever the Minister's intentions are, the "actively seeking work" test will be arbitrary, inconsistent and unfair and will inevitably involve subjective judgments about a claimant's state of mind and intentions by people of junior rank and little experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our anxieties are greater because we do not believe that the procedures described by the Minister will always be followed in an office that is under stress and busy and when someone is fed up, has a headache and is dealing with the 60th case of the day. Also, claimants find themselves in unfamiliar surroundings, are frightened and feel harassed, and many will not have English as their first language, which presents special difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment can be put straight into the Bill, and I am sure that it will be extremely helpful. We are suggesting that what may or may not have been said at interviews of which there is no written record is no safe basis on which to deprive people of their legal right to benefit. An awful decision may be taken against people which may disrupt their lives for a month—possibly longer if they have to go into debt—and they will get onto the awful cycle of deprivation, financial loss and disruption that will follow. Amendment No. 71 attempts to give substance, in our usual constructive and helpful way, to the Minister's undertakings. We offer it to him complete, simple and explicit and with its high literary quality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the amendment, the procedure would not mean simply handing the claimant a leaflet. Experience at all levels, and certainly that of the DSS, is that, despite the great work over the past 20 years or so to turn the leaflets from incomprehensible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0188">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>299</span>
gobbledygook into relatively simple English, there is still a high level of incomprehension among recipients of leaflets produced by the DSS. Also, there is a strong reluctance by anyone to read anything that is longer than a few dozen words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that there is a problem in many inner-city areas in England with the lack of translated information? I do not know whether that applies also in Wales. Does he not think that the Department should make more strenuous efforts than it has to date to provide information in all the relevant languages for each locality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) that it is not just a problem in England. There are strong gaps in understanding because of it. I do not intend to stray from the subject, but I do not believe that any nation in the world is more arrogant than first language English speakers about people who do not speak English as a first language. The assumption is made that speaking English is as natural as breathing. It is something that one learns and anyone who does not speak English is clearly being perverse and awkward and uses his alternative language for speaking about other people. If anyone is speaking in a language other than Enlgish, he is clearly doing it to talk about those who only speak English.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give a vivid demonstration: Os rwy'n troi at Gymraeg yn y Pwyllgor yma rydwi cael ei drefn gan y Cadeirydd. I am waiting for it. I said, "If I turned to my first language in this Committee, I'd be called to order by the Chairman." This is the only Parliament that we in Wales have—we can come to no other Paliament—but the language of Wales has the same status here as riotous behaviour. If I continued to speak in Welsh and refused to stop, I should be thrown out of the Committee or the Chamber. One day, someone might do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled an early-day motion on the subject some time ago—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall finish this distraction in a moment. My early-day motion suggested that we are now a multi-lingual nation. Many languages flourish—for example, the Asian languages are a rich addition to our culture—and we should use them. All kinds of devices are available for translation and it is not the great hurdle that it once was. We should look to the many people who find difficulty with English because it is not their first language and ensure that we are dealing with them. It is implicit in what we are saying that the mother tongues of all people who apply should be respected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that the advice given should be relevant to the circumstances of the individual claimant and tailored to his or her particular needs and capacities. We are suggesting that an individual letter to each claimant should be required. The Minister may say that that would involve a lot of work. We return again to the fact that the Government have created their own monster. If the procedure is to operate reasonably, it will be tiresome,
	<span class='label label-info column'>300</span>
difficult and expensive to carry out, but it must be done that way to make it work fairly and justly. The "actively seeking work" test is not our idea, but that of Ministers, and we do not believe that there is any way to carry it out that will not involve additional administrative burdens. The amendment should be passed because it would fulfil the Minister's hopes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other advantage of the amendment, as well as explaining precisely to claimants what their position is, is that it would require one week's written notice. That would give claimants a cooling-off period before benefit could be cut off and would avoid many of the other difficulties that we have pointed out such as the loss of benefit for a whole month. The claimant would have the opportunity to understand fully the explanation, take it home, discuss it, think it over and reach a decision that would probably avoid any cut-off in benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The claimant will have been specifically reminded of what constituted 'actively seeking employment' and will have been given an opportunity to take appropriate action, before the question of whether he fails to satisfy the test arises".</p></blockquote>
We want it to be made absolutely clear, by written evidence, that those steps have been taken. We also want to ensure, so far as possible, that the claimant understands the warnings that he has been given. Putting those warnings in writing is the obvious way to achieve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the amendment would give some semblance of legality to the proposed procedure. The Minister's proposals, as they stand, are not consistent with the requirement that the claimant should be actively seeking employment each week. Indeed, the Minister stated in the debate on Tuesday morning that a claimant who failed to take active steps in a particular week would simply be warned to do better in future. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He might well be warned more than once before benefit was withdrawn, but that would happen only when people simply declined to take steps to seek employment."—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 31 January 1989; c.186.]</p></blockquote>
Under clause 7 as it stands, that procedure is plainly illegal. The amendment would make it legal, and is consistent with the Minister's aims as he spelled them out, and it would at the same time build in some sensible, worthwhile safeguards for claimants while avoiding the cutting-off of benefit to many people. Therefore, it should be acceptable to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My worry about the amendment, for which I have some sympathy—I certainly admire the way in which it has been drafted—is that it would introduce a rather too bureaucratic and inflexible system of informing claimants about the steps that they should take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not weary the Committee by going over the process because we have already described many times the advice that is given when someone first goes onto benefit. Incidentally, people would not, as the amendment suggests simply receive a leaflet— they would get oral advice at the same time. The UB 671L availability leaflet is published in 12 languages, and the actively seeking work leaflet will be published in the same number of languages. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0189">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>301</span>
hon. Member for Newport, West will be glad to know that that includes the Welsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the question of whether people are actively seeking work arises they will be informally counselled and advised about the steps that they should take. I am worried that the amendment may lead to a lack of flexibility in the communication of advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not fall over in surprise when I say that I am not unsympathetic to the requirement that people be warned in writing that they are in danger of losing their benefit. I wish to consider the exact terms, so I shall not give an absolute undertaking, but I shall consider the suggestion sympathetically to assess the ways in which that written warning or advice could be given. Given that, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 23, in page 5, line 20, at end add—

<br><br><!-- lb -->
'(2A) A statutory instrument containing (whether alone or with other provisions) regulations under section 17(1)(a)(i) (so far as it relates to persons being deemed to be actively seeking employment) or section 17(2)(aa) of this Act, which are made before the coming into force of section 7 of the Social Security Act 1989, shall not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before Parliament and both Houses by resolution approve the draft either without modification or addition or with modifications or additions to which both Houses agree, but upon such approval being given the instrument may be made in the form in which it has been approved and on being so made shall be deemed to be valid and within the powers of this Act.'</li>
	<li>(b) in subsection (3), after the words, 'subsection (1)' there shall be inserted the words 'or subsection (2A).V.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I should place on record that the purpose of the amendment is not to persecute DSS officers. I have an uncomfortable feeling that for the past few years, whenever such officers look at the Order Paper they say, "Oh God, not amendable regulations again."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although amendable regulations may be tediously familiar to officials, they are not to most members of the Committee. We have heard the extent to which the sensitive provisions in the Bill will be imposed by regulation. We have no assurance that we shall see a draft of those regulations. I am confident that my hon. Friends—and even some Conservative Members—realise that we should consider a procedure that allows regulations to be amended. The amendment would ensure that the regulations made under the clause—not all regulations—would be amendable, provided that the amendments are approved by both Houses of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will be familiar with the normal procedure that regulations are laid before the House, are accepted or rejected in their entirety, but cannot be amended, even to correct errors. Department of Social Security regulations are frequently wrong, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>302</span>
the Department can do nothing about that, except withdraw them and go through the process again. That inconveniences the Department and everyone else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that when we raise the matter—we did so first under the guillotine so it was rather perfunctory—the Department thinks that we are just trying to be difficult. As time goes on, social security legislation increasingly just paves the way for regulations, with policy decisions coming after legislation in a form that is not amendable. Therefore, it would be sensible for the Government to consider amendable regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, the debate has highlighted the crucial importance of regulations. We do not seek to undermine all the proceedings on regulations—about 2,000 statutory instruments are made each year, and we do not suggest that it would be practicable, or necessary, to allow a Committee stage debate on all of them. However, regulations such as those made under the clause are an exception because of their importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been unable to give detail of the contents of regulations and has tried to reassure us that the regulations will allow reasonable handling of cases. Those assurance are not necessarily valid under the Bill as drafted. If the Minister is unable to carry out the assurances that he has given, there should be some opportunity to change that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have observed a crucial change during our debates on the clause. The notes on clauses have been redrafted since we first met, which is not so long ago. Heaven knows what changes may occur between the completion of the Committee stage and the regulations being drafted and laid before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is absurd for hon. Members to spend hours in Committee debating issues arising from Bills when we are unable to raise any of those issues when regulations come before the House. Although the amendment proposed an exception to that rule, it does not break completely new ground. As we reminded the House last year, solid precedents exist for putting such provisions in a bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am confident that you will concur, Mr. Winterton, with the judgment of my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West (Miss Boothroyd) that "Erskine May" at least is divine, the 20th edition of "Erskine May" says, on page 617:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Power has occasionally been given to both Houses to approve a draft Order in Council or draft departmental order with modifications, and in such cases the orders could only be made with such modifications as have been agreed to by both Houses. If the two Houses differ in their amendments, machinery must be improvised for reconciling the differences."</p></blockquote>
"Erskine May" goes on to mention an occasion relating to the Government of India Act 1935, when the need for such machinery arose and a procedure was devised. That is not the only precedent. The Joint Committee on Delegated Legislation has a list of such precedents: the Delays in the Court of Chancery Act 1850, the Electricity Supply Act 1919, the Census Act 1920, the Emergency Powers Act 1920, the Local Government Act 1933, and the Education (Scotland) Act 1962. Eighteen Acts include
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0190">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>303</span>
provisions such as those described in the amendment. We have used the Local Government Act 1933 as the basis for the amendment. It was passed by a National Government with a Conservative majority. Clearly, the amendment has precedents that the Government will find attractive. As the Government are returning elsewhere in the clause to the provisions of the 1930s, it is eminently rational to suggest that they follow this rather better precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of making ultra vires regulations has been mentioned because, Parliament may wish to do something that is beyond the Secretary of State's powers. Secretaries of State, including those involved in social services, have recently made regulations that go beyond their powers. The Secretary of State would not be obliged to make regulations in the amended form if he felt that an amendment, even though agreed by both Houses, had defects. He could behave as he does now when defects arise—even when those are caused by problems in his Department—he could withdraw the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would enable the Department to correct mistakes. The Department always seems to have to make regulations in a hurry, because of the amount of legislation that the Government push through. The amendment would also allow scope for sensible discussion of problems that seem to arise when regulations are unsuitable and would be better if amended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is a serious proposition and I hope that the Government will give it serious consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to delay the Committee, but I feel strongly about the amendment. Those of us who have sat on the Committees that considered the previous two or three Social Security Bills know that we have always heard the placating words of various Ministers who say "Don't worry about that, we shall take consideration of it in the regulations." The Minister said that it would be wrong to lay down now the criteria under which people would lose their benefits, for whatever reason. That is vague. Having flexibility sounds nice. However, because of past experience, I do not believe that the flexibility referred to by the Minister is the flexibility that we understand. Flexibility should benefit the clients, but it has always benefitted the Government, who have used it to change the criteria or the emphasis, depending on whether their figures on how many have been taken off the dole queue having been calculated correctly. That has happened time and again. It certainly happened when budgeting for who should receive mobility allowance. Changes are made in regulations and we do not know about them until a client tells us that he has lost his benefit for some obscure reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter today from a lady who has a pain in her left leg and can walk only 20 yards. She does not qualify for mobility allowance because the pain is in her leg, not her back, although officials concede that she cannot walk because of the pain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>304</span>
The relevant regulation is 23/1 or something equally obscure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult for anyone making representations on behalf of clients—as it is for the clients themselves—to argue their case when there has not been the chance to debate and amend the regulations. Only the people who are affected, and people like ourselves who make representations on behalf of clients, understand the effect of the regulations. Being unable to debate the regulations arising out of three or four previous Acts has left us high and dry when dealing with people in our constituencies and DSS offices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Debating the regulations would give us a greater opportunity to introduce provisions that would meet the needs of all concerned. That has not happened in the past. We do not believe that it will happen in the future unless we have the opportunity to discuss the regulations to make them fairer all round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot countenance the idea that both Houses should approve draft regulations with modifications or additions as appropriate. It would be a profound change to agree to reintroduce a power that has not been used for a long time. It is no longer a feature of modern legislation, and may have implications not only for regulations but for Orders in Council, and so on. The hon. Member for Ladywood will remember the frequent passage of arms that we had when we were discussing Northern Ireland matters and the unamendability of Orders in Council. If we were to go back down that road, the proposition should be considered on a wider basis than in the context of a single Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of regulations these days is to delegate a legislative function to Ministers. It is unusual, not to say inconsistent, for Parliament to delegate a function and attempt to exercise it. I am advised that there are only five Acts of Parliament still in force that contain the power. The most recent of those was passed in 1920. Even when that power was theoretically around, it was used only rarely. For all practical purposes, amendable instruments have ceased to be a feature of modern legislation. If it does not like a set of regulations, Parliament has the power to reject them. The Government would then have to go back to the drawing board and produce a new set to submit for Parliament's approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unsatisfactory to include such a provision in the Bill. I do not think that the hon. Member for Derby, South will be particularly surprised at my answer. However, the present provision states that the regulations under the clause should be negative procedure resolutions. I am prepared to accept in principle that, certainly the first time that the regulations are made, they should be subject to the affirmative procedure. The regulations will be important, and it is appropriate that, at least when they are first introduced, they should be considered under the affirmative rather than the negative procedure. I am advised that the appropriate way to achieve that would be for a Government amendment to clause 25 to be moved in Committee. So, although I must resist this amendment, I hope in due course to be able to provide for the change that I have outlined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that only five Acts of Parliament are still in force which such regulation-amending powers exist, and the last one was passed in 1920. How shocking. It will not do for the Minister to say that because it has not been done since 1920, in cannot be done now. Britain's constitutional arrangements have evolved over time to meet the conditions and necessities of the age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Bagehot were around today, he would find the House of Commons a dignified part of the constitution, but, like his discovery about the Privy Council, the bits that are for show are the pretend arrangements for running the country and secretly the Cabinet is running it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will make an enormous difference to the lives of millions of people, some of whom already
	<span class='label label-info column'>306</span>
have a very difficult life. The Bill has a big hole in the centre, like the Polos that my hon. Friend the Minister for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) is eating. Whenever we probe the Minister for details of how it will operate and how difficult and vulnerable groups will be dealt with, he assures us that the regulations will cover those matters yet we see nothing of those regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members seem to have no respect for their own rationality or integrity and are willing to vote for this packet of Polos. The crunch is yet to come, as we do not know its effect on the lives of real people. That will depend on regulations, which we shall not see until the Bill is passed. We are then told, "Big deal".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West said, we are grateful for any small concession. The Minister said that the regulations will require the affirmative resolution of the House, but any old piece of junk can be voted through the House if the Prime Minister of the Cabinet say so. That seriously diminishes our democracy and is no credit to Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that regulations are never provided before Royal Assent, but he could give us a draft of the regulations without breaching the great tradition that has existed since 1920. At least on Report we could know the details of what the Government have in mind for the regulations, which could even be improved by the debate. I know that the Minister is a traditional Tory, despite the fact that he serves in this rotten Administration, but will he be a little radical and brave, and seriously consider giving us the draft regulations before Report? That would be an attractive precedent, as it would show a little respect for our parliamentary procedures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In response to the hon. Member for Newham, North-West, I am aware of the broad thrust of the regulations, but the detailed drafting—as the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. It is funny how even the most arcane and dry subject sometimes yields something worth while.

I listened carefully to my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood, but did not hear every word because my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West had a brief word with me. I hope that I am not repeating what she said, as I do not wish to bore the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one is seeking an excuse to resist an eminently sensible proposition, one can stray into dangerous territory. The Minister justified his

	<span class='label label-info column'>307</span>
resistance to the amendment by quoting the fact that only half a dozen Acts were left with a regulation-amending provision. He said that it was a procedure no longer used in modern legislation and has not been used since the 1930s, but the clause restores a test that has not been used since the 1930s, and the Government do not deem that unsuitable for modern legislation. It is interesting to note how the ground shifts depending on the proposal with which one is dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are unlikely to persuade the Minister, but I am grateful to him for saying that the regulations will first be laid under the affirmative procedure. Perhaps that should have been in the Bill from the beginning, but we have at least made some ground.

I should like to recount the experience of a rock roller from Blackpool and a Christmas decoration maker from Rhondda. They are both subjected to the rules for seasonal workers, which are due for an overhaul.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first story concerns someone who worked in a rock-making factory in Blackpool. She was a victim of the rock recession, which may not have affected many of our lives but affected hers badly. It started in the winter of 1980 and she was laid off for three or four months. At first, she received unemployment benefit when she was not rolling rock, but in 1985 an adjudication officer decided that, as a seasonal worker, she was no longer entitled to benefit. She appealed against the decision and, in a recently published decision, a social security commissioiner ruled in her favour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rule that disqualifies seasonal workers from unemployment benefit during the off-season applies to anyone who has worked for at least three years in a seasonal occupation, whose off-season normally lasts more than seven weeks, and who cannot reaasonably expect to find other work during that time. I do not want to influence Conservative Members by stating the justification for that rule, they may suggest that people who have gone on holiday to seek work should deluge the local rock
	<span class='label label-info column'>308</span>
rolling factory with applications. They could be in the season when rock rolling is at its height—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or length.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. However, we must contend with the disappointing slump from which the rock rolling business has still not recovered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arcane justification for the rule is that someone who chooses to earn his or her living in an occupation that involves working only part of the year should not be able to live on unemployment benefit for the rest of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second case concerns a man from the Rhondda valley. His case was taken to appeal by my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Rogers), who enjoys the distinction of having the largest majority in Wales. That distinction may not last much longer as someone called Kim Howells will probably have it before the end of the month. As I have digressed to mention inadvertently the Labour candidate, I should also mention the two Conservative candidates for the Pontypridd seat: an unofficial candidate who represents the Keith MacLeod pro Peter Walker faction, the real human face of Conservativism—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is fascinating but not really relevant to the amendment. I have quickly gone through it to check that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One could say that those two Conservative candidates are engaged in a seasonable oocupation that will last a mere three weeks. They will have a real fight for last place and neither will save his deposit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda was employed making Christmas decorations. She had done that for some years past, like the Blackpool rock factory worker. It is normal for the Christmas decoration trade to be closed for part of the year. The claimant was willing and able to take other work and the tribunal decided, on appeal, that she was entitled to the benefit that was withdrawn from her. In a recent report on the subject the Social Security Advisory Committee acknowledged that there was a case for abolishing the special rules for seasonal workers provided that the machinery could be devised for testing their availability for work in the off season. They recommended a review of the role of unemployment benefit in relation to the whole range of intermittent working patterns including temporary and part-time work. The Government are sympathetic to that view. The Secretary of State's response to the SSAC's report was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We welcome this helpful and constructive report and thank the Committee for its work in compiling it."—</p></blockquote>
That has a familiar ring and is usually followed by a but—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government accept the Committee's view that the problem of seasonal workers is only one aspect of a wider problem concerning the relationship between unemployment benefit and the whole range of intermittent working patterns.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The contents of the report and the views expressed by the Committee will be taken into account as part of the continuing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>309</span>
process of reviewing the role of social security benefits paid to unemployed people."</p></blockquote>
There is a half promise there. In a written answer which is possibly even more promising the Minister stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"we propose to abolish the outdated and complicated rules applying to seasonal workers claiming unemployment benefit. At the same time, the income support rules for calculating notional earnings of seasonal workers will be removed. We also propose to amend the unemployment benefit earnings rules where they operate harshly on people earning very small amounts and yet leave the benefit of people in highly paid weekend jobs unaffected. Our proposals to add a de minimis provision to the so-called "full extent normal" rule and to introduce a cut-off point, at which those on high earnings from part-time work will lose all benefit in the week concerned, will remove these anomalies.—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 16 December 1988; Vol. 143, 	<i>c. 752–3.</i>]</p></blockquote>
Those changes are still awaited. The amendment makes one of the proposed changes to give the Government an opportunity to present us now with their full proposals, which in many ways are of great importance and significance to many other parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 58 attempts to deal with the "full extent normal" rule—a thoroughly discredited rule that is the cause of many problems. When the Secretary of State introduced the present Bill, he said that we had to have a social security system which helps, not hinders, the country's growing prosperity. One of the measures already contained in the Bill is aimed at ensuring that the long-term unemployed are not afraid to take up a job opportunity because it might not work out in the long term. If that proves to be the case within a prescribed time, the person will be able to leave the job without fear of losing benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of that measure, there is no justification for the continued existence of the rule known as the "full extent normal" rule. In an number of recent decisions, both the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords have been extremely critical of this rule, which is regulation 7(1)(e) of the Social Security (Unemployment, Sickness and Invalidity Benefit) Regulations 1983. In a judgment in March 1988 Lord Templeman said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the claimant who has a chequered history of full employment, unemployment and part-time employment, reg 7(1)(e) bristles with ambiguity and doubt…</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The obscure language of the regulation compelled the Commissioners to invent by a process of judicial legislation tests which are not to be found in the words of the regulation and are, therefore, hedged around with qualifications".</p></blockquote>
That is a thoroughly unsatisfactory position. Those who sit on appeals have to invent a process to get round the existing legislation because of the defects. The alternative would be to make a decision that would be manifestly absurd and unjust. Other judges have referred to their great hesistation and reluctance to reach decisions. They have described the decisions as indefensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment benefit is awarded or denied on a daily basis with reference to an individual's days of unemployment, excluding Sunday or a day substituted for it. Before a claimant can be entitled to unemployment benefit he or she must show that he or she is both capable of work and available for work or, as the Government now propose, actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>310</span>
In their White Paper, the Government pointed out that some employers are prejudiced against the long-term unemployed. It is often easier to move from part-time to full-time employment than from unemployment into a job. The White Paper states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are … barriers of both prejudice and lack of knowledge to be overcome before some employers are prepared to give unemployed people a fair chance at a job."</p></blockquote>
Unemployment benefit should be paid with reference to each day of unemployment, and those who have relieved the burden on the national insurance fund by obtaining part-time employment should not be penalised for that, or discouraged from taking up such work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, however, is the effect of the full extent normal rule. I shall quote from another judgment made in July 1987 in the case of a 63-year-old claimant. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"He had been in full-time employment throughout the great majority of his adult life. After some periods of unemployment between 1979 and 1982, in May 1982 he again got full-time work but in September 1982 was again made redundant. His application for unemployment benefit was rejected because he had a job, in which he was self-employed, as a collector of footballs pool coupons. The work occupied about one hour a week on Friday evening. He earned by it about £3 per week. The Commissioner … held that the claimant could not escape from reg 7(1)(e) …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Commissioner added:"… I can see no way in which I can properly circumvent the words of the legislation and thereby obviate a preposterous result. Whether anything will ever be done about it by the legislature I do not know. In this corner of the law … there appears to be an extraordinary antipathy to remedying injustices which save departmental money."</p></blockquote>
People who have worked full time and who are in part-time work because no full-time work is available may properly be held to be employed to the full extent normal in their case, despite their wish and intention to obtain full-time work. Another judgment of July 1987 reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"None of the interpretations of the test 'to the full extent normal in his case' which have so far been discussed appear to draw any discernible line of social or other sensible policy distinction between those who are eligible (for unemployment benefit) and those who are not. How can that have been in accordance with the intention of the legislation? Presumably the legislation has some underlying policy purpose."</p></blockquote>
If it has, perhaps we shall hear it now.
	<br><blockquote><p>"But where it is reflected in the various interpretations of reg 7(1)(e)…which have been published and discussed?"</p></blockquote>
There is no trace of it.

It seems to be impossible to identify the original intention of the policy, and suddenly there seems to be no case for its continuation. I see from the Under-Secretary's face that we may have good news.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Service. They were halcyon days. It was a time of full employment, a time when we had a Government with a human face, and I am sure that they had good reasons for introducing the rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we have said before, all Labour Governments were better than any possible alternative Tory Government, but we do not pretend that they were perfect. Nor could Conservative Members seriously say that of previous Conservative Governments—certainly not that headed by the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath), with his U-turn. Does my hon. Friend agree that one major shift in the labour market in recent years has been the significant growth in female participation rates and in the proportion of part-time workers? Because of those changes, it is now urgent to amend a provision that dates back to 1948.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Minister, if he responds to that comment, will do so only in so far as it is relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It comes down to the original intention, which I did not mention, but that original intention has since been subjected to a series of decisions made by the commissioners, which have become the established practice. The commissioners and legal people are now telling us that there is a need for fundamental change. The year of 1948 was a time of full employment, when it was expected that unemployment would disappear altogether, except for people who were unemployable, and that was very nearly achieved. The social security system was seen as a safety net. Certainly, people did not go, as many do now, from being employed to unemployed to partly employed and get caught in the indefensible catch of full extent normal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the full extent normal rule is simply to deny benefit to those who wish to work full time but who, because of their circumstances, end up in part-time jobs. The alternative, of course, is to leave or not to take up part-time employment, although that damages the people themselves and society generally. Surely it cannot be the intention that those who take up part-time employment, while still seeking full-time work, should be penalised in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have already quoted Government answers, but there was another written answer on 16 December 1988 to which I referred briefly, about the de minimis povision that is to be introduced to the full extent normal rule. Presumably, the Minister will tell us how it will be introduced, and if we accept the amendment, we shall be taking one step towards eradicating a rule that works in a way that is unfair, wasteful and cruel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was no oversight that those two items are not dealt with in the Bill. It is not the right place to deal with them because they are made in regulations and the correct way to change regulations is not in primary legislation but to introduce amending legislation. One introduces new regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>312</span>
However, I am grateful to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) and his hon. Friends for tabling the amendments because it gives me the opportunity to say where the Government stand and to reinforce what was said in answer to a parliamentary question in December. We intend to revoke the additional condition for unemployment benefit which seasonal workers claiming in their off-seasons have to satisfy. We therefore anticipated amendment No. 57 in that parliamentary answer, and I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends have reached the same conclusion. I detected in his remarks—although he did not make it the central point—a feeling that the new "actively seeking work" test will make any special conditions for seasonal workers unnecessary. Our intention is that seasonal workers should qualify for benefit in the same way as everyone else: that is, they will need to show that they are available for and actively seeking work. They will no longer be subject to special rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Abolition of the seasonal worker's rule has—as the hon. Gentleman rightly said—been considered on a number of occasions but to date the availability condition has not been thought strong enough to distinguish between people who deliberately chose seasonal work with no intention of working in their off-seasons and those who took only seasonal work because there was an absence of permanent jobs. That rule certainly operated harshly in areas where there was not much work—particularly in tourist areas—other than seasonal work. One of the many benign benefits that will come from the changes under clause 7 will be that we shall be able at an early date to get rid of that rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 58 relates to the "full extent normal" provision. I was disappointed that the hon. Gentleman could not explain the policy behind it, but he may have been a little unfair to the Labour Government in implying that there seemed to be no good reason for it. I think that there is a good reason for a rule of that nature, but I agree with him that the way in which the current rule works is unfair and unsatisfactory. It has imperfections and we intend to modify them. The operation of the current rule gives rise to modify them. The operation of the current rule gives rise to anomalies, which the hon. Gentleman illustrated, in which some people are disallowed benefit as a result of a small amount of earnings whereas others can retain benefit even though their earnings—made almost invariably at a weekend—do not affect their benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of those problems, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State announced in answer to a parliamentary question before Christmas, we propose to add a "de minimis" provision to the rule and to introduce a cut-off point, at which those on high earnings from part-time work will lose all benefit in the week concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to amend the regulation to ensure that a person does not lose unemployment benefit by the operation of the rule unless his earnings exceed £12 a week. A person whose earnings in a seven-day period reach the lower earnings threshold for national insurance liability—currently £41 rising to £43 in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>313</span>
April—will no longer be able to draw unemployment benefit for any day in that period. We shall refer the amending regulation to the Social Security Advisory Committee in draft form in the near future. Those changes will remove the aspects of the rule that come in for criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not go as far as the hon. Gentleman wishes in his amendment, I am sure that he agrees that the proposals will be fairer. We hope to bring the new regulations into operation by the end of the spring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have not been able to promise the hon. Gentleman all that he asked, we have gone a long way down the track, and have met the hon. Gentleman's suggestions on seasonal work. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be willing not to press his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I disagree with the number of benign benefits introduced by the Bill. The Minister said "several" or "many"—we should halve that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since I began speaking, I have remembered that the rule did not start in 1948. I am authoritatively informed—from a source that has proven to be far more reliable than some of the Minister's sources—that it was laid down in case law between the wars and was intended to deal with cases in which the claimant did not normally work every day of the week. Commissioners' decisions since then have completely perverted the role's purpose. It now hits people who hold part-time jobs, and assumes that that imcome is their normal weekly income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rejoice in the agreement between both sides of the Committee and do not wish to spoil it. We are
