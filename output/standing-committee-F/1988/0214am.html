DISQUALIFICATION FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 111, in page 6, line 6, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) After subsection (1) of that section there shall be inserted the following subsection—
<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) For the purpose of determining the length of the period for which a person is to be disqualified under subsection (1) above for receiving unemployment benefit, the adjudication officer or other authority making the determination shall have regard to all the circumstances of the case and shall not determine that the person is to be disqualified for 26 weeks unless there are exceptional circumstances'.".</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to make it clear beyond any doubt that the maximum period of disqualification in cases of so-called voluntary unemployment should be imposed only in exceptional circumstances. Of course, we do not mean to imply that we approve of the power to disqualify for as long as 26 weeks. We opposed the extension of the period to 26 weeks, and we opposed the previous extension of the period to 13 weeks. However, the amendment draws attention to the fact that the 26-week period is a maximum.<br><br>
If someone has voluntarily left a job without a just cause, unreasonably refused suitable employment, or has in some other way come within the disqualification provisions in section 20 of the Social Security Act 1975, the adjudication officer is obliged to disqualify that person for some period. Depending on the circumstances, the law provides that the period can be as long as 26 weeks or as short as a day. Between those limits, as a tribunal of commissioners stated in its decision in 1974, adjudication officers and appeal tribunals have complete discretion as to the period to be imposed. In a more recent decision, CU 32/86, another commissioner explained both the history and the present state of the law:
<br><blockquote><p>"It was held by a Commissioner in decision R(U) 17/54, applying the insurance princple, that normally the maximum period of six weeks' disqualification"—</p></blockquote>
as it then was—
<br><blockquote><p>"should be imposed and that a heavy burden lay on a person to establish that a lesser period was appropriate. Consequently, it became almost automatic for insurance officers to impose a maximum period of disqualification. In R(U) 8/74 a Tribunal of Commissioners decided that this was an incorrect approach and that each case should be regarded as one in which a 'sensible discretion' fell to be exercised. If cases that have come before the Commissioner since then are any guide I should infer from what I have seen of them that this latter decision has had practically no effect on the practice of insurance (now adjudication) officers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
imposing disqualification. They seem still to impose the maximum period in practically every case. When there is an appeal they draw the attention of the appeal tribunal in their submission to what was said in R(U) 8/74, but quite frequently … the tribunal … affirm the period of disqualification without its appearing that they have given any consideration to that aspect of the case."</p></blockquote>
The commissioner goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"I am emphasising the point now because of the changes made by the Social Security Act 1986 … First… the maximum period of disqualification has been increased to thirteen weeks by section 43(2) of the Act. And this was presumably done by Parliament in the knowledge of what had been decided in R(U) 8/74. It is thus essential that adjudication officers should abandon their old habit of virtually automatically imposing the maximum."</p></blockquote>
That was said in 1986, which was before the Government doubled the maximum period again to 26 weeks. The Commissioner went on to say that appeals to the Commissioners would in future be limited to points of law and that appeal tribunals were likely to be held to have erred in law if they did not show in their decisions that they had consciously exercised discretion in imposing disqualification, stating the facts that they had taken into account when doing so.<br><br>
Since the maximum period of disqualification was first increased to 13 weeks, a survey of some 500 disqualification cases was carried out by the Department of Health and Social Security at the end of 1986. 1 believe that that is the survey to which the Minister has referred. Its findings were disturbing, showing that the law was still being flouted and that the maximum disqualification was still being imposed indiscriminately. According to a report on the survey placed in the Library in March 1988, 75 per cent. of disqualifications were for the full 13 weeks, as it then was. The attached table showed that 80 per cent. were disqualified for more than 12 weeks and only 10 per cent. were disqualified for six weeks or less. The report said:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is no indication that either the reason for leaving or the time taken to decide a case has any bearing on the length of disqualification imposed."</p></blockquote>
Among the main findings selected by the authors was the fact that in a high proportion of cases, no detailed reason for leaving was given beyond voluntary leaving for misconduct. It is clear that even if adjudication officers had wanted to exercise their discretion they did not have the information with which to do so.<br><br>
This is a serious matter. I clearly recall a case in my constituency where a young woman was forced to leave her employment as a result of a prolonged dispute with her immediate superior. She had no dispute with the firm as a whole and ultimately obtained excellent references from her overall employer but there was a conflict of personality between her and her immediate boss. One of the reasons why she came to me was that he refused to deal with the question of whether, when she had voluntarily made herself unemployed, there was any misconduct. He refused to discuss the matter with the Department knowing perfectly well that while he refused to answer any questions and cast any light on the reasons why she left, the chances were high that she would remain disqualified from benefit and suffer a penalty. Once the facts of the case were resolved she did not suffer that penalty but he was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0280">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
able to use this procedure to punish someone whom he had already driven out of her employment.<br><br>
In April 1988 the maximum period was increased by the Social Security Act 1988 to 36 weeks. The Minister has stated that no sustained information is available on the proportion of cases in which the maximum was still being imposed. The Minister told us that the effect of the increase in the maximum of 26 weeks is being monitored and that the results might be available next year. It was suggested that the chief adjudication officer had examined a small sample of cases and that that showed that the maximum period of disqualification was now imposed in about 50 per cent. of cases. We concede that 50 per cent. of cases is better than 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. However, bearing in mind that the maximum period is now six months it is horrifying that adjudication officers, despite clear guidance from commissioners about their legal obligation to exercise discretion in every case, are still imposing the maximum disqualification in 50 per cent. of cases.<br><br>
I would not wish to suggest that adjudication officers should take all the blame for this. It is far from clear what considerations they are expected to take into account in exercising their discretion. Much depends on whether one believes that this part of the law is there to punish people for refusing to take a job or for leaving a job—which we consider they have a perfect right to do—or to protect the insurance fund from unnecessary claims. If it is there for the former reason, the Government would presumably regard with some indifference a punishment as long as six months as they chose to extend the period so that it could be that long.<br><br>
If, as we believe it should be and as it was envisaged, the law is there to protect the insurance fund from unnecessary claims, obviously the questions to which adjudication officers should apply their minds are how easily the person could have prevented his unemployment and how quickly he can reasonably expect to find another job. Even if one believes that it is a penalty, the circumstances in which disqualification is imposed are themselves infinitely varied and so, too, is the degree of blame that is attached to the individual involved.<br><br>
There are few other areas of law where the norm is the maximum penalty. Maximum penalties are normally reserved for the most serious cases. That is the principle that we seek to embody in the amendment. A message should be conveyed to adjudication officers and appeal tribunals that it is no longer necessary merely to rely on what the commissioner thinks Parliament intended. Parliament should tell them that they have been entrusted with a discretionary power of great importance, which affects a person's basic right to a minimum income.<br><br>
In deciding whether someone should lose that right, and for how long, all the circumstances of the case must be considered. If it is decided that disqualification is inevitable, the appropriate duration of that disqualification must be considered—it can be from one day to 26 weeks
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
The maximum period of disqualification should be imposed only in exceptional circumstances. That is what Parliament has always intended, but that has not happened in practice. We hope that our amendment will persuade the Government to bring practice into line with the intention of the law. That should help adjudication officers and appeal tribunals.<br><br>
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux expressed its continuing concern that the cases it sees, and suggested that the maximum period of disqualification is almost always automatically imposed. It has discussed that with adjudication officers with a view to trying to get them to exercise their discretion, and it appears that adjudication officers have received no clear guidance on the criteria that they should take into consideration when deciding to impose fewer than the 26 weeks of disqualification.<br><br>
A tribunal member has written to us:
<br><blockquote><p>"Section 20 disqualifications are a nightmare. Parliament has given us an unfettered discretion to decide for how long a claimant should be disqualified, but without offering guidance on how we are to exercise our discretion. We are not a court of law, punishing people for the offence which the law does not in fact recognise. Our function is simply to balance the interests of claimants against those of the fund and its contributors. Some of us feel that the old limit of six weeks' disqualification was quite sufficient, and in many cases more than sufficient, for that purpose. But we are now told we can disqualify for 26 weeks. Does that mean we should normally disqualify for 26 weeks? Does it mean that, in a case where in the past we would have disqualified for 6 weeks, we should now disqualify for 26 weeks? Or does it mean that there is a minority of cases in which Parliament has decided that the interests of the fund require a longer disqualification, and that in the normal run of cases we should continue to disqualify for six weeks of less? Obviously different tribunals would take a different line, making the whole thing a lottery. From everybody's point of view, Parliament's intentions on this subject need to be clarified."</p></blockquote>
That is the purpose of the amendment, and I hope that in the light of its clarification of the law, the Minister will feel able to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I acknowledge the hon. Lady's reasons for tabling the amendment, and the force of some of the points that she made in moving it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: But.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed—but, I have to refer back to the point that, at the moment, the adjudication authorities have unfettered judicial discretion to determine the length of the disqualification period. As the hon. Lady acknowledged, they have to take account of what was said by the commissioners in the 1974 case, that in considering the period of disqualification, adjudication officers must consider each case on its own merits and exercise sensible discretion. In RU/4/87, the commissioner affirmed that the adjudication authority in the case concerned—a social security appeal tribunal—must consciously exercise discretion in each case in imposing disqualification and must state the facts taken into account when exercising that discretion.<br><br>
The requirement that each case must be examined individually means that there is, and can be, no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0281">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
norm. Even the maximum cannot be considered a norm. Each case is exceptional and should be so treated by the adjudication authorities.<br><br>
As I said earlier, we are monitoring the effects and the working of the new length of period and the behaviour of the adjudication authorities under the 26-week period.<br><br>
On the tiny sample of 100 cases, I should not even go so far as to say that I told the Committee that I drew the conclusions from that tiny sample that 50 per cent. of the cases were attracting the maximum disqualification. Of that sample of 100 cases, 53 had attracted it, but that is much too small a sample from which to draw a wider lesson. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Lady will, on reflection, agree to await the outcome of the monitoring process and the experience that the chief adjudication officer draws from monitoring it. We can then see whether more guidance—perhaps of a statutory form—should be given to adjudication officers, who have the difficult task of coming to such decisions.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
The amendment mentions exceptional conditions without attempting to define them, and says that the maximum period of 26 weeks can be imposed only in exceptional circumstances. Nothing would stop 25 weeks, or even 25 weeks and five days, from being imposed, even if the circumstances were not exceptional. The amendment is flawed in two ways. First, it does not attempt to graduate the period according to the seriousness of the offence. Secondly, it does not describe what should be regarded as exceptional circumstances. The Committee should reject the amendment on those bases. However, I undertake that we shall monitor the position carefully. When we have a more representative sample of the effects, I shall consider whether more needs to be done and, if so, how it can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I was not here at our last afternoon sitting, and so missed the Minister's important contribution. In moving the amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) developed the theme that many people have good cause for leaving their employment. It is difficult for a customer in the present procedure to prove that good cause.<br><br>
In an earlier sitting, I spoke about wages in Birkenhead and mentioned bar work being remunerated at £1 an hour. I must apologise for using the term, "bar work", because the advertisements that I saw were for cleaners working in pubs. I was pleased to see that the Minister employed great talent during the adjournment to obtain further information from the Birkenhead jobcentre.<br><br>
The case that I shall report is relevant to the one that my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South put forward. We can all be selective in the information that we present. Like the Minister, I wish to continue that selective argument and then put some general points.<br><br>
I was sad that the Minister's report from the Birkenhead jobcentre did not present a rounded
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
picture about wage levels. I have the advantage of living in Birkenhead and have several mates who have been to the jobcentre for me, whereas the Minister can call on civil servants. When the Minister reported back to the Committee, he did not mention the wages at which some of the jobs were offered. For example, an advertisement for a cleaner/labourer, working Monday to Friday, 8.30 to 5.30 is offered at £35 a week.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall listen attentively to the hon. Gentleman's points but, to be fair, he should not implicitly criticise me for responding to the point that he put to the Committee, on which I was able to give specific information.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) replies, I shall try to help him. His remarks appear superficially to apply to a debate that the Committee has already concluded. Does he seek to relate his statistics to exceptional circumstances?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Very much so, although part of the case is that they are far from exceptional. We would regard them as exceptional, were we presented with this information.<br><br>
I accept that the Minister responded to the fact that I used the term "bar work", and I should have used a more general term. Given that he is a fair person and is anxious to understand our anxiety about how the measures might work, he might have asked his civil servants to provide him with information about not only bar work but the other wage rates that are presented in the jobcentre. The Minister interrupted me after the first example, so I shall not give him all the examples because clearly he is a bit tender on this.<br><br>
It is a pity that when the Minister was talking about how labour markets operate and the sort of information that might be presented to our constitutents as a result of the Bill, he did not give a more rounded picture. For example, one job which was probably at the jobcentre last Thursday because it was there on Monday was for a general labourer, Monday to Friday, 8.30 to 5.30, at £35 a week. That employer has the courage to put the wage rate with the advertisement. Another job is for a temporary driver, working throughout Britain, with variable hours over seven days a week at £60 to £75 a week.<br><br>
When we talk about wage rates and some of the jobs that people will be offered, it is important that we take the full record into account and not a selective one that may have arisen because of the phrase that I used. Therefore, I ask the Minister to use the break that we shall have at lunchtime to ask his colleagues who served him so well last Thursday to get back onto the Birkenhead jobcentre and ask the staff there to take down all the cards which the employer refuses to put a wage rate, so that individuals have to go and ask what the wage rate is. The Minister will know that most employers are not anxious to put their wage rates on such cards because they are so shameful.<br><br>
Secondly, the Minister comforted the Committee about the bar wage rate, but will he give the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0282">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
Committee, and, much more important, our constitutents, an undertaking that when the Government reform—as it is politely called—of the wages council machinery is completed and statutory protection of some wage rates is abolished, those wage rates will not be pushed down towards that 8.30 to 5.30, £35 a week level?<br><br>
Thirdly, if the Minister asks his colleages to do their work well in the jobcentre or asks those workers in the jobcentre who are conscientious about their task—and thank God, many are—he will discover that there are jobs which are sometimes advertised as commission only. There is no way that anybody will know whether he will get any money at all or £100 a week. Will the Minister give an undertaking that such jobs will not be used to test whether people are actively seeking work?<br><br>
Finally, I was pleased with the attention that the Minister gave to our debate on Thursday morning. I ask the Committee to contrast the attention and effort that went into undermining what he thought was one point that I was making with that which has gone into the general point that we have made all along. The sort of service that he gave me after our last sitting should be given to each one of our constituents who is actively seeking work. They should not be threatened with finding work and be told to go off and find jobs, but should be given the sort of attention that I was given so that they can find real jobs. We are talking about what the Prime Minister would call wages in the real economy. They are not makeshift jobs; they are real wage rates.<br><br>
Therefore, I am grateful to you, Mr. Winterton, for the help that you gave me in moulding the comments that I wanted to present to the Committee after the friendly exchange that the Minister conducted in my absence on Thursday. I have asked him a number of specific questions that are relevant both to the whole Bill and to the issues that my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South raised in moving the amendment. Throughout the debate we have been trying to show that when a conflict or a dispute occurs, each side is unequally matched and our individual constituents trying to protect their rights to unemployment benefit are no match for the employment officers, let alone the Minister, who has the whole Civil Service at his disposal to help him, within a lunchbreak, undermine one of the points made by a member of the Committee.<br><br>
The Minister will be pleased that I have put on the record a reference to real jobs and real wage rates in the real economy—as the Prime Minister would say—in the Birkenhead jobcentre. Will he now find out about all those jobs which are advertised with no wages so that the Committee can have a rounded picture of the labour market in Birkenhead? Will he call in those cards at lunchtime and get his civil servants to tell him what the wage rates are? Will he guarantee that wage rates will not fall further than the ones that he cited last Thursday when the wages council machine is abolished, and will he give an undertaking that jobs that advertise commission only will not be chucked at our constituents when they are fighting off the prospect of being pushed into a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
wage level that is way below the benefit level to which they are entitled?<br><br>
With those comments, and with thanks for your kindness, Mr. Winterton, I bring my support of my hon. Friends amendment to a close for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I always seek to be even-handed, but there are limits to the assistance that I can give. At this stage, I will not say more than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, labour under the disadvantage of having missed our final afternoon sitting last week. However, I rise fresh from having tested some of the Bill's propositions in the streets of Richmond, where the Government are losing all the arguments on social security.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alan Amos <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hexham)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We will win the vote.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Time will tell.<br><br>
I support the amendment which the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) forcefully and eloquently moved. There is substantial worry about the way in which tribunals are deciding cases under the new regime which allows them to disqualify for up to 26 weeks. From my experience of having had people ask my advice on occasions, I suggest to the Minister that, if the Government do not take the opportunity to clarify matters, people will appeal to the commissioners as a matter of course. That is not an easy process.<br><br>
In many cases, one is restricted to points of law, and one doubt is about whether the discretion exercised by the appeal tribunal gives people an opportunity to question a decision on a point of law. Will the Minister advise me on whether the Government feel that that is appropriate? If the proper questions are not asked at the appeal tribunal about the number of weeks for which it has been decided to disqualify a claimant, in the Government's view does that constitute an opportunity for the claimant to appeal direct to the commissioner on a point of law prima facie? There may be some difficulties in terms of the technical legal argument.<br><br>
The council on tribunals must eventually come into the argument. As the Minister knows, it oversees the work and produces reports on how tribunals work. Do the Government have any influence on what questions the council considers? As the rest of the tribunal system is a freestanding, independent body, the council on tribunals may also be independent—therefore, at arm's length from Government. It may be impossible for Ministers to influence the subjects that it considers. Even if it is entirely independent, I should have thought that the Minister could have a quiet afternoon sherry with the chairman or the officer servicing that committee. It is a suitable subject for the council on tribunals to examine.<br><br>

It is extremely worrying that the maximum 26 week period is apparently being taken as the norm. The Minister said that he is monitoring the situation. I was not here last Thursday afternoon and I do not know whether he said how long that would take, but people are suffering week in and week out. Something that irks claimants more than anything else when they are caught by this rule is that they are totally ignorant of it. In the fairly hot and immediate situation where questions arise about contracts of employment they act in a way that prejudices their claims. If they knew of the regulations and how they operate and if they conducted themselves slightly differently they would be much more able to argue their case at an appeal tribunal.<br><br>
A bit of education, a bit more dissemination of facts about how the rules apply in the work place is needed. The disqualification period went up from six weeks to 13 weeks in 1986 and from 13 weeks to 26 weeks in 1988. Who knows what it will be in 1990? It is regrettable that it might be a full year by then. Like the hon. Member for Derby, South I believe that the system now looks like a punitive system rather than a sensible system which in exceptional circumstances is used to disqualify people.<br><br>
The Minister attacked the hon. Lady's argument saying that the exceptional circumstances were a bit vague. That is no problem to lawyers. Parliamentary draftsmen can easily come up with a definition in regulations or wherever for exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances should be allowed only where there is perverse and wilful ignorance or rejection of the terms of the contract of employment. A further condition should also apply: a person should also be fully aware that his action would disqualify him. In a situation like that, if someone gave up his job voluntarily there would be a case for a maximum disqualification at whatever level the Government set it, but there is a graduation below that, which covers a wide area and a wide range of different circumstances. Only in one or two cases of the many that I have been involved in as a Member of Parliament was the maximum disqualification period justified. Many people are being disqualified for the maximum period when it is not justified.<br><br>
The claimants in that situation are frightened and perplexed by the bureaucracy which hits them. It is much easier for an hon. Member or a CAB adviser to deal with it. The CAB does sterling work here. It advises people and tries to put the best construction on the claimant's case. The situation is extremely worrying and we cannot allow it to continue for long. The hon. Member for Derby, South convincingly made the case that the appeals tribunals are floundering about and trying to make the best use of these provisions. The advice that they are getting, certainly about the will of Parliament, is leading them to false conclusions. The Government should treat this as a matter of urgency. I hope that the Minister will tell us that his monitoring system will be brought to a speedy conclusion and, if he is not prepared to accept this amendment, that amending regulations will be brought in at an early stage.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would argue about the Minister' imprecise use of language. He said that all cases are exceptional. It is fair to say that all cases are unique—they all have different characteristics and no case is like any other—but it is wrong, and it is a misuse of the word, to use "exceptional" in that way. If something is exceptional it is different from the norm. Its use there cannot be justified.<br><br>
Our aim here is very sensible. I shall not burst into song, although there is a song which goes:
<br><blockquote><p>"My object all sublime</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I shall achieve in time—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>To let the punishment fit the crime".</p></blockquote>
I have my doubts whether we shall but it is a simple request that makes good sense. It is sometimes useful to look at other circumstances and the problems that arise when the punishment does not fit the crime. Before Christmas, my car was stolen from outside my flat in London. It had been there for some 20 minutes. The police were informed immediately. Three days later when I was at home, having taken my family there in a hired car, I received a call from an embarrassed policeman to say that the police had stolen the car. The branch of the police responsible for removing illegally parked cars had not told the rest of the police that it had taken it. It had recently been privatised, which may be neither here nor there. Eventually, possibly because of the address my complaint came from, the police apologised and climbed down. My car was parked for 20 minutes and was not a dangerous obstruction. I queried the police hierarchy of punishments. A fine would have been reasonable. I would have had no complaint about that as it was on a single yellow line but it was in a place where cars are parked routinely.<br><br>
The police argument was that regardless of where a car is parked, the maximum penalty has to be used on certain occasions, that is a bit like saying that occasionally a shoplifter should be hanged to discourage the others. The weakness of the argument is that if my car is towed away for being parked on a single yellow line for 20 minutes where it is not a dangerous obstruction, why not park in the middle of Picadilly circus or an area where it could be a dangerous obstruction? There should be some hierarchy of punishment to match the offence.<br><br>
The Minister says that our amendment is flawed because we do not spell out what exceptional circumstances are. As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) says, they can easily be defined and could thus be recognised by people on tribunals who have unfettered powers and are asking for some fetters and some guidance. All the evidence from casework and from the report is that the ultimate sanction is used in 75 per cent. of cases. That cannot make sense. If the Minister accepts the principle of the amendment we should be delighted to table further amendments to define the exceptional circumstances more precisely. This is at least a start. The Minister should accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot assure the hon. Member for Birkenhead that we will further interrupt the excellent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0284">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
work that the Birkenhead office is doing to provide him with figures. However, I can give him a more representative set of figures from the scene as it existed last Thursday which led to my responding to the specific point that he made. I shall do so briefly, Mr. Winterton, as you might get a little edgy otherwise.<br><br>
No jobs were on display at £1 an hour in the jobcentre last Thursday. The lowest figure—these were for part-time jobs—was for £1.75 to £2 an hour for a care assistant. The pay ranged from £1.75 an hour, £2 an hour, £2.20 an hour, £2.50 an hour and so on up to £40 for 14 hours for a demonstrator. That was the information that I would have given had the hon. Gentleman not been engaged elsewhere on important parliamentary business.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of commission-only vacancies being offered. Jobcentres offer commission-only vacancies because, in some professions such as insurance, that is the normal method of remuneration. It would be wrong not to have such vacancies on offer for people who require that sort of employment, as they had traditionally earned their living that way. However, there is no question of Birkenhead jobcentre, or any other, offering commission-only jobs to people who have no experience of working on that basis. I give a clear undertaking that the thrust of the employment service is to counsel, give advice, and match the skills of unemployed people with the jobs on offer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Clare Short <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I would have expected the Minister to give that undertaking on commission-only jobs, but, as there is a provision in the Bill that income from the job will be irrelevant, I am not sure whether he is legally in a position to give that undertaking. It will no longer be possible to take into account the level of income when deciding whether a job is suitable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I said anything about that. I was saying that the employment service will be counselling unemployed people and helping them to match their skills to available employment. That is the point that I was trying to make.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am trying to make is that the Minister is giving an undertaking that no one will be required to take commission-only jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are talking not about the level of remuneration, but about the character of that remuneration. Commission-only jobs can sometimes pay extremely well, depending on the success of the person doing the job. It is not a matter of the level of pay in commission-only jobs, but the different way in which people are paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was grateful to the Minister for blowing the whistle and not asking the Birkenhead jobcentre to do any more homework for him. It is a pity that, when he looks at wage rates, he does not ask those at the jobcentres, if they have any spare time, to call in the adverts in which no pay is mentioned, just to see what the employer is offering.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
I accept that there were no jobs at £1 an hour on Thursday. I cited one which was on the cards—on the racks—on Monday which paid less than £1 an hour.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) is right about commission-only jobs. Although we have gone past this aspect of the Bill in our deliberations, the point is relevant because the Minister has raised it. Because he is a good soul, he has given an undertaking that people who do not normally work on a commission-only basis will not be offered such jobs. But as my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood said, that undertaking, sadly, is meaningless, because people will be unable to say that there is no suitable work for them. After a time, the job market will be thrown open, and those people must scale down their aspirations. Unless the Bill is amended to sanctify what the Minister has said, people will be presented as refusing jobs without good cause, and refusing commission-only jobs which may pay enormous sums of money, but which are more likely to pay very little, will be used as a reason for disqualifying such people from benefit. That shows the importance of the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister responds, I remind the Committee that the amendment deals specifically with the discretion of the adjudication officer. It would ensure that the maximum disqualification period of 26 weeks should be made only in exceptional circumstances. I have allowed a wide debate, not least because of the important matters raised by the hon. Member for Birkenhead, and the Minister has graciously responded. However, I hope that this element of the debate can now be kept brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I do not question your ruling, but I ask you to develop it. You are right in saying that the amendment deals with what the adjudication officer does. Our problem is that the adjudication officer will see only what is on the statute book and will not know what the Minister has told the Committee. That is why we have raised the point in this way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has raised an important point, but I suspect that, despite what some people may think, the proceedings of the Committee are quite widely read. I am sure that the civil servants present will ensure that what is said here is drawn to the attention of those who need to know.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course adjudication officers use their judgment in such matters. After the permitted period has expired, if someone were offered a job working for commission only, it would still be relevant for him to say that he had no experience of any such employment, and use that as a reason for refusing the vacancy. That would be an important factor for adjudication officers to take into account. I do not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0285">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
believe that the employment service would normally offer such a vacancy to someone who had no experience of working on commission only. It is a difficult and challenging way to earn a living, but it can be very rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If those circumstances arose, would the Minister expect customers—the unemployed—to cite in their defence what he has just said?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Adjudication officers can talk to those who make such judgments if it is felt that a job is not suitable for someone because of lack of experience and skill in this respect.<br><br>
I shall deal briefly with the points made by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). He was not present in Committee when I accepted an amendment to take away the power by regulation to extend the period beyond 26 weeks, so that there would be a need for primary legislation. Obviously, I cannot bind future Ministers or Governments to that, but I accepted the amendment to make it clear that it was not remotely in our mind to extend the period beyond 26 weeks. We retained the power to shorten the period, but removed the power to lengthen it.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman again referred to the word, "exceptional", and how those who share his profession are well attuned to interpreting that, as they are to interpreting "reasonable" and other such words. I base my argument on two legs. First, he made no attempt, however vague, to define "exceptional". Secondly, there is nothing to prevent the adjudication authorities from disqualifying someone for 25 weeks and five days—just short of the maximum period—even when the circumstances are not exceptional.<br><br>
I think that Opposition Members are groping for the point that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) tried to make, after agonising about the removal of his vehicle, about the withdrawal of benefit—I cannot use the word "punishment"— reflecting the change of a whole range of circumstances. The commissioners said that adjudication officers should take that into account. We shall find out whether that happens in practice when we monitor the process.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire also asked if, at another stage in the process, the proper questions were not asked, that would provide grounds for an appeal on a point of law. Prima facie, I am advised that that would be grounds for such an appeal, but obviously, circumstances may vary and all sorts of details will have to be taken into account.<br><br>
The Council on Tribunals and the tribunal system are independent of Government. The only matter that I have ever discussed with the chairman of the Council on Tribunals concerned the staffing of his service reducing the delays in hearing appeals. I do not think that he would take kindly to my attempting to guide him, over sherry or even something harder, in the way that he runs his totally independent system.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also asked how long the monitoring process would take. It has to be long
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
enough for us to get a sensible sample. I should have thought that about 12 months was an appropriate period, but I do not wish to be bound to that in case it is thought to be either too long or too short. We need a period like that to give us a proper idea of how the new system is working, the percentage of cases in which the maximum is being imposed and whether it is being imposed unreasonably.<br><br>
In the tiny sample of cases that I mentioned in earlier debates and alluded to again today, where the maximum period of disqualification was imposed in 53 cases, the adjudication officers who were monitoring the process decided that a shorter period could have been applied in seven of those cases. That is a substantial percentage of the 53 xcases and if the pattern eventually turns out in that way, we shall take account of that.<br><br>
I am not sure about the position. I want to examine the results of the monitoring first, and then see what—if anything—Parliament needs to do. I sympathise with the wish of Opposition Members to ensure that the period of disqualification matches all the circumstances of individual cases. However, I cannot say how we shall endeavour to achieve that if, after the monitoring exercise, we feel that it is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, will the Minister give us an idea of the ball park figures for the savings that the Government have made from disqualified benefit since 1986? It would be useful to know whether it is a large sum—I suspect that it is not.<br><br>
Secondly, I remind the Minister that exceptional circumstances additions were a feature of the supplementary benefit system for many years before 1980. Indeed, the Government used the term exceptional hardship in their regulations on supplementary benefit for young voters. So there should be no difficulty with using the term, "exceptional".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat what I said before: I based my argument on two cases—the meaning of "exceptional" in this particular case, and the fact that nothing would stop 99 per cent. of the maximum period from being imposed without exceptional circumstances being considered.<br><br>
I understand that approximately £30 million in a full year would stem from the changes that we have introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is always fairly courteous to us and I do not wish to be discourteous to him, but when he said that the Opposition were groping for argument, I felt that he was groping for an excuse to justify resisting the amendment.<br><br>
The Minister says that he would not even go so far as to draw conclusions from the monitoring of the small sample of cases examined by the chief adjudication officer. As years go by, one becomes accustomed to interpreting otherwise mysterious forms of words. The Minister really means that he strongly suspects that the maximum period of disqualification is still being applied in 80 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0286">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
or more of cases, despite what those figures reveal. He does not wish to find himself in the unfortunate position of being in the same job next year and having us hang those words around his neck. As he has no confidence in his case for resisting the amendment he keeps saying that when there is a more representative sample, he will consider this matter further. Like us, he suspects that a more representative sample will confirm our argument.<br><br>
The Minister went on to explain how the position can be monitored. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said, there cannot be a norm, and the maximum should not be the norm. That will be news to many adjudication officers, or so it would appear from the way in which they presently operate the law.<br><br>
The Minister says that each case is separate and should be so treated. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West said, the fact that each case should be approached individually does not mean that the word, "exceptional" cannot be written into the Bill. That word occurs in many laws and regulations and there is no difficulty in interpreting it, unless one wishes to have difficulty. One of the joys of our Civil Service is that, should the Minister wish to justify the use of the word, "exceptional" in legislation, civil servants can provide a host of examples of where it has been used before. If, on the other hand, he does not wish to justify it, memory plays them false and they sit quietly while he says that it is hard to see what would happen if the word were written into the Bill as the amendment suggests.<br><br>
The Minister says that another fault with our amendment is that it suggests no graduation of penalty. The Government write legislation that says, "There will be a system of income support" and leaves the details to regulation, yet the Minister wants us to write into the Bill what the graduation of penalty should be and exactly how many weeks the penalty should be applied. Naturally, he wants no such thing; he is simply wriggling because he can find no better excuse for rejecting the amendment.<br><br>
We then come to the ultimate absurdity. The Minister says that even if our amendment were accepted, an adjudication officer could still impose a period of 25 weeks and five, four or one and a half days. That is true, but we seek to give greater guidance to adjudication officers. They should listen to the guidance that has been given before and it should be set clearly on the record that the 26 week period of disqualification should be imposed only in exceptional circumstances.<br><br>
I was about to be unkind to the Minister and remind him of the brief from Central Office that has been sent to Conservative Members, but I forgot to send him a copy as I promised. Question 7 in the section on trial periods asks:
<br><blockquote><p>"What is the idea behind this new power?"</p></blockquote>
Those of us who were brought up in the Catholic religion will be familiar with the catechism that has been adopted. The answer is:
<br><blockquote><p>"The lengthy period (maximum 26 weeks) for which a disqualification can be imposed for leaving work voluntarily is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
thought to be deterring some claimants from taking unfamiliar work."</p></blockquote>
Those are the words of Central Office. The evidence of those whose job is to support the Government is given in the context of explaining the trial period, but the evidence remains that the disqualification period is deterring claimants from taking unfamiliar work.<br><br>
We are not prepared to accept the Minister's argument that we should hang around and wait for more evidence to back up the evidence that has been available since the period was doubled to 13 weeks—it has now been doubled again to 26 weeks. The way in which the system has worked proves that many people will not only lose their rights to benefit under this provision—often unjustly to judge by past evidence of the social security inspectorate—but will lose it for very long periods of time. Disqualification is automatically imposed whether or not it is justified. Because people must wait so long for appeal, any notion that they may have succeeded in their appeal before the expiry of the 26 weeks can be ruled out.<br><br>
As our concern for individuals who lose the right to income is stronger than our concern to save the Minister's face, I advise my hon. Friends to press the amendment to a Division.</span></p>

<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 93, in page 6, line 9, leave out "may" and insert "shall".</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All the amendments refer to the power which the Secretary of State will take in the proposed new subsection (4) to section 20 of the 1975 Act.<br><br>
Amendment No. 93 would require the Secretary of State to make regulations, rather than leaving it to his discretion. Far be it from me to argue enthusiastically that more stringent regulations be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0287">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
made, but I should rather have a regulation which is understood, clear, firm and fair, than leave it to discretion, with all the complications, confusions and injustices that can occur. Therefore, I am not supporting all regulations, but there is a need to ensure that there are proper guidelines about what is a good cause.<br><br>
As it stands now, subsection (2) not only empowers the Government to make regulations laying down what is a good cause—and I agree that it is important that we have such guidelines—but gives the Secretary of State power to lay regulations and take into account circumstances that will not be considered to be a good cause. That is what our fears are about. Every situation is different, cases are complex, and there may be more than one reason for a person appearing not to have a good cause. In the interests of clients, and to ensure that the officer involved is not too restrictive, regulations should state what is a good cause, but should not lay down criteria on matters and circumstances that cannot be considered a good cause.<br><br>
Our problem is that there is no definition of good cause anywhere in the regulations or the legislation. Commissioners have avoided laying down any criteria or rules because the circumstances of each case will be different—often considerably different. It is important that the precise circumstances in each case are considered. Therefore, the regulations should be as broad as possible. They should not be limiting by specifying circumstances that cannot amount to a good cause. That is important, not just so that the regulations are fair to the client, but because, in some cases, there may not be enough evidence to prove good cause, so benefit will be lost. Flexibility is important in determining the length of disqualification.<br><br>
The question of what is good cause can be debated at length. Is location of the employment or the training offered a good cause for not taking a job? It may be, because a client may have to refuse employment or training in a location outside his home town, city or village because of family circumstances, such as caring for a sick relative or child. It is important that it is on record whether that is a good cause.<br><br>
Is danger to health from the job a good clause? What if the hours are incompatible with child-care arrangements? Is that a good cause for not taking a job? Hours may vary or begin unreasonably early for a mother with a young child. What about health and safety factors? Do they represent good cause?<br><br>
No one would deny that there are bad employers. Some employers sack workers who refuse to change their working practices. They do not refuse to change practices from bloody-mindedness, but because they know that the practices will be dangerous. In our great, competitive world, engineering companies ask, or insist, that experienced workers control and manipulate more than one machine. Even experienced workers feel that that is intolerable and dangerous, and they often lose their jobs because of it. Once that happens, the employer may advertise those jobs.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
We are worried that jobcentres will force unemployed people to apply for such jobs so that they do not lose their benefit. That would be highly dangerous. The Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation would admit privately, if not publicly, that there are bad eggs within its organisations. I did not mean to use the words "bad eggs", as they tend to get politicians into trouble. Let us say that there are a few rotten apples in the barrel. Therefore, it is important that, when adjudicating officers inquire into good cause, they recognise that some employers are so bad that that is good cause.<br><br>
It might be useful to take a leaf out of the Economic League's book and have a list of bad employers pinned up in various offices. The Opposition could provide the evidence. A list of bad employers would help everybody. People in the industry could help to compile it—both employers and trade unions, if there are any.<br><br>
I am sure that many hon. Members have experienced the problem of monitoring small businesses by the Health and Safety Executive. It has lost many officers, and does not have enough officers to carry out its normal duties, so it cannot monitor dangerous practices. That is not a criticism of the Health and Safety Executive. It does not have enough staff. Obviously, in small firms there is little trade union organisation to look after workers' interests.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman: <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is neither sensible nor logical for an employer deliberately to allow an employee to be damaged? The idea that there are wicked employers around who do not mind if their employees get damaged is silly. We might just as well ask why we do not have a register of employees who have a reputation for being too casual about safety.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point, but if she thinks that there are no bad employers, I am not sure which world the hon. Lady lives in. It is certainly not in the world of engineering or steel.<br><br>
There are bad employers and there are accidents. Why did the Government reduce industrial benefit for fingers, hands and so on? It was not because accidents did not happen, but because they happened so frequently that the Government decided to save money. Accidents happen all the time, and anyone who does not believe that is living in cloud cuckoo land. There are bad employers. If that is the attitude of the Government Back Bench—I hope that is is not—we are in serious trouble, and the amendments are even more important than I thought. There are bad practices which are not properly monitored. In the absence of proper regulations and of good evidence, the regulations that we are asking for should be as flexible and as wide as possible.<br><br>
There are other reasons for questions on good cause. For example, what safeguards are there for the purposes of religious and moral grounds, illness and pressing family needs? I gave an example to the Commitee examining the last Social Security Bill. It may sound flippant, but it is not. Would a young

man be expected to work in a slaughter house if he were a committed vegetarian? It may sound silly, but it is a possibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is ridiculous, not silly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is intolerance again from the honourable Lady who cannot get off her backside to make the point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend would like to put on the record what the sedentary intervention was.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not hear it. It probably was not of any importance, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that it was not so much silly as utterly ridiculous to suggest that a vegetarian would be forced to work in a slaughterhouse. It is such rubbish that it does not seem to be worth debating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Then I assume that the hon. Lady will vote for our amendments, because, obviously, the officers concerned and the Government would consider it to be ridiculous. So let us put it on the record: such things cannot happen.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend think that the hon. Lady might not have been attending to the Bill in as much detail as the Opposition have? She might not appreciate that, under the Bill, people will be required to take up a job which will no longer have to be a suitable job. It is reasonable to ask whether, for example, a vegertarian might be required, under the threat of loss of benefit, to take a job in a slaughterhouse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is true. The problem, which has been highlighted by interventions from the Government Back Bench, is that there is a lot of ignorance about what happens in the outside world where people toil for a living—if they can get work. We have discussed the wages structure, and I do not want to go over that again, but it is a serious problem.<br><br>
The Government and, more important, the officers who conduct the interviews and make the judgments must understand the situations in which they are sending out clients to find jobs. They cannot judge in isolation and without experience. That experience is not about a list of jobs on the wall but about location, conditions and so on. That is why the regulations must be as wide as possible and contain as little limitation as possible. In the absence of any evidence in the notes on clauses of how the regulations making powers are likely to be used, it seems sensible and fair to limit them. Perhaps the Minister will explain what is intended.<br><br>
Amendment No. 94 again limits the Secretary of State's power, and I draw the attention of the Committee to the corresponding provision under clause 10 for the 40 per cent. reduction from income support in similar circumstances. Page 20 of the notes
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
on clauses, under the title "Use of the regulation-making powers under subsection (2)" states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The powers enable regulations to be made to ensure that a claimant is treated in the same way for both unemployment benefit and income support. In particular these regulations will mirror those made under powers in clause 7(2)…, 7(3) and"—</p></blockquote>
the important point—
<br><blockquote><p>"9(2) (factors to be taken into account or not and reasons to be regarded as adequate or not in deciding 'good cause')."</p></blockquote>
The importance of the notes on clauses is that they make no mention of matters which may not be taken into account. Therefore, there appears to be an anomaly. At first, one might think that there is a reason for the difference, but on reflection I can find no reason for it and neither can any other Opposition Member, and we have looked at page 20 of the notes on clauses.<br><br>
There is an anomaly, and the Minister should accept amendment No. 94 if for no other reason than the great principles and arguments that I have put forward. It will save his Bill from being a bit silly and will bring it in line with clause 10.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This important amendment seems to be the only one in the Amendment Paper relating to clause 9(2). Opposition Members on Committees considering social security Bills are always worried about what will be in regulations. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) made a passing reference to that, and I wish to explore a little more fully what is in the mind of the Government. They must by now have a clear idea of what the drift of the regulations will be. I should be surprised if it were not heavily based on established case law and there are certainly strong indicators about what can and what cannot constitute "good cause".<br><br>
The regulations that will flow from subsection (2) will be of the first importance to how the clause will work. All members of the Committee know that the powers for scrutinising regulations leave much to be desired. There is no power to amend. I have not yet cracked the code that enables people studying primary legislation to discover whether a regulation is affirmative or whether it is intended to be a negative regulation, so we do not even know whether we will be guaranteed a debate, or will have to pray against it. It would be useful to know whether the regulation falls into the affirmative category because that would at least guarantee us one and a half hours in the middle of the night at some future date to look at the fine print.<br><br>
It is not good enought for the Committee to let subsection (2) pass without at least some inquiries into what is in the Government's mind and what consideration is being given to case law on the relevance of such factors as age, health, religious belief and domestic responsibilities to both what is and what is not a good cause for refusing to take up a vacancy. The regulations are of fundamental importance and the Minister has a duty to spend time not just on vague general descriptions but on giving us as much information as possible on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0289">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
what their content will be so that the Committee may form a sensible judgment on how they will work in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 93, as the hon. Member for Hillsborough—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Sheffield, Heeley. If the Government have not got my constituency right, they cannot get anything right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Opposition do not have the amendment right, and I shall explain why. The Opposition are trying to place an obligation on the Secretary of State to make regulations prescribing matters or circumstances that are relevant when considering good cause. I suppose that the intention is really to place an obligation on the Government in relation both to matters and circumstances. The surviving word "or" at the end of page 6, line 12 means that in practice that intention would probably not be achieved by the amendment.<br><br>
The other amendments are in a different category and they would remove the power to prescribe matters and circumstances that shall not be taken into account by the adjudication authorities when considering whether a claimant should be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefit. I shall deal with that issue in my response to the amendment.<br><br>
Let me say first that in broad terms I share the Opposition's concern to see greater authority in legislation to guide the adjudication authorities in their decisions. It would also help claimants to understand their benefit rights, and I am anxious to do that to the maximum possible extent, especially where, as here, there is some change in the existing provision.<br><br>
We propose, therefore, to use the powers in both paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (4). The purpose of paragraph (a) is to set out—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 93 would replace "may" with "shall". As it stands, the Bill provides the power to make regulations, but it does not require those regulations to be made. If the Minister is now saying that he will make the regulations, will he accept the amendment?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given the Committee a clear undertaking on the regulations. While we intend to have regulations under both paragraphs, we do not wish to tie all future Governments to that.<br><br>
As I was saying, the purpose of paragraph (a) is to set out circumstances to which we wish the adjudication authorities to have regard in reaching their decision. Let me say to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire that we do not propose to have an exhaustive list of such circumstances. We want to leave the adjudicating authorities the power to take account of other circumstances that seem to be relevant. However, we have it in mind, as the hon. Gentleman tentatively suggested, to take account of current case law when we frame the list. We shall take
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
into account whether the employment in question would seriously harm the individual's health, and whether it would conflict with a religious or conscientious objection. That should please my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) because I believe that her example would be counted as a conscientious objection. We shall also take into account whether the claimant's domestic responsibilities would make it physically difficult for him to undertake the employment and whether the travelling time involved in reaching the employment would be excessive. We propose that travelling less than an hour in each direction, unless that was unreasonable because of the claimant's health, would not constitute good cause. That is an example of what does not constitute good cause also being included in the regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Saying that travelling time is not good cause and putting it in regulations does not take into account other circumstances—for example, when young children or sick relatives are involved. I understand that in itself, an hour's travel does not constitute good cause, but the surrounding circumstances may.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are also the circumstances that I outlined earlier, which would be taken into account in constituting good cause. It is the claimant's health that is important in terms of an hour's journey each way, which I do not believe is unreasonable. The majority of people in this part of the United Kingdom are used to journeys of at least that length. There is a need to include in the Bill the power to prescribe circumstances that do not constitute good cause, as well as those that do.<br><br>
We have not yet finalised our consideration of what should be in the regulations and indeed, as with other aspects of the Bill, we are grateful to members of the Committee for expressing their views, to which we listen with care. Opposition Members may wish subsequently to draw our attention to matters that they feel might usefully be examined for possible inclusion in the regulations.<br><br>
We shall use the regulation-making power of both subsections (4)(a) and (4)(b). However, for the reason that I outlined in response to the intervention of the hon. Member for Ladywood, it would not be right to tie Governments to have regulations always under both paragraphs, which seemed to be the purpose of amendment No. 93.<br><br>
I have mentioned one area in which we should want to set out what would not constitute good cause. We do not at present have any other ideas that could be included under that heading, but we want to retain flexibility in that and other areas. The amendments would limit flexibility, rather than maintain it.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire asked whether the regulations would be made under the negative or the affirmative procedure. They would be made under the negative procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Oh.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0290">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman might wait until I have finished the sentence, because he might be pleased at what I have to say.<br><br>
I made the concession that regulations relating to clause 7 should be affirmative, because they are important to the thrust of the Bill. The same arguments apply to clause 9, so we shall take the necessary steps to ensure that regulations under the clause will be dealt with under the affirmative rather than the negative procedure—at least when they are first introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, I am disappointed, if not surprised, that the Minister does not accept the amendment. If he is worried about the drafting defect in amendment No. 93, he simply has to draft another amendment to replace "or" with "and". In that case, we can safely leave the amendment as it is and leave the Minister to make the necessary alteration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley can have listened to me as carefully as usual. I explained that even to insert "shall", so that the drafting of the amendment achieved its presumed intention, would introduce inflexibility and tie the hands of future Governments in an undesirable way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what the Minister means by inflexibility. He is saying that we need guidelines and regulations about what constitutes good cause. Surely there will be enough positive instruction and guidance in those regulations to take care of any anomaly that may arise in the other set of regulations dealing with matters which do not constitute good cause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the inflexibility to which the Minister referred is akin to the rigidity in the labour market that will be eased by clause 7.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rest my case.<br><br>
I have an awful feeling that, once the Committee stage has finished, the Bill has been enacted and its effects trickle through to our constituents and the adjudication officers, what has happened before will happen again. There will be many little debates and arguments about what constitutes a just cause. But we should be positive and say, "These are good causes", and anything not covered should depend on the circumstances, the area, the officer, and so on.<br><br>
Why should travelling for less than an hour be included in the regulations as not constituting a good cause? That could be left to the officer's discretion. What about the cost of travel? Travelling may take only an hour, but the cost of it may make the job financially unattractive. The person may end up losing more money than he gains. Those problems are likely to arise. How would the adjudication officer or, indeed, a Member of Parliament, deal with such a case? It could be argued that someone has a good cause because it is covered in the regulations, but the adjudication officer could say that it is not a good cause, because the matter cannot be taken into
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
account, as that is also in the regulations. We end up with two different arguments.<br><br>
I cannot understand why we need to have the negative regulations. We just need the positive regulations, and everything else can be left to the common sense of the adjudication officer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have from the Minister an undertaking that he will introduce regulations under these powers, but he is not willing to accept an amendment which would tie any future Government to having such regulations. That seems a contradiction in itself, because, if there is commitment to one set of regulations, presumably there will be regulations for ever, unless they are repealed, when there would be case work. So the logic of the Minister's refusal to accept an obligation to introduce regulations does not stand up.<br><br>
What the Minister told us was important and significant. I am talking about the pathetic little bits of information that he gave the Committee about how the Government's mind was working and what issues might be covered in the regulations. He told us that travel of under an hour would not be good cause, but that, when it is over an hour, it might start to be. Matters of health, family responsibility and conscience were also included.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: An hour's travel in Sheffield would take a person about 40 miles, because of the marvellous road system, but an hour's travel in London would probably take a person next door.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I am sure that the quality of life in Sheffield is superior to the quality of life in London in terms of travel. Probably the most significant aspect of the requirement that employment should be suitable, which is abolished by the Bill, is that it included the rate of pay. Even if people had not been able to get a job within their traditional skills or qualification and had to widen their choices, they were not required to accept a job that did not pay the rate that a decent employer in the area would pay. That is now abolished. What will be laid down about the levels of income that people can expect? The subsection states:
<br><blockquote><p>"but, subject to any such regulations, in determining for the purposes of that subsection whether a person does or does not have good cause for any act or omission, there shall be disregarded any matter relating to the level of remuneration in the employment in question."</p></blockquote>
The Minister has been silent about what provision for level of remuneration will be included in the regulations. A few moments ago, he told us about commission-only work with no salary, and said that there would be some provision for that. If the regulations are silent about the level of remuneration, which is what the Minister implied, it can never be a good cause.<br><br>
Despite high unemployment, some jobs offer such foul levels of income or dreadful employment conditions that people will not take them. Unless the Minister gives us something in the regulatons about levels of remuneration, people will be forced, under
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0291">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
threat of loss of benefit on a weekly basis, to take any job at any rate of pay and under any conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Many people, including Conservative Members, do not realise the full implications of this. An editorial in the <i>Yorkshire Evening Post</i> welcomed this Bill in general outline. It added that it was unacceptable to expect a professional person to sweep the roads. Under the Bill, however, that is acceptable. People will be invited to accept any level of remuneration. In practice, professional people will not be hit by it, but people at the bottom level will be priced down even further. Many people do not yet realise that under the Bills if an unemployed person is offered a job at any level, he will not have grounds for refusing it, no matter who he is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. This goes back to the examples that my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) used which so irritated the Minister so greatly and had civil servants wasting time ringing the Birkenhead jobcentre. We talked about older workers. Many people in the west midlands worked their whole lives in the steel bashing industry. Those hard working people were laid off in the recession induced by this Government in 1980-81, and they have not worked since. Under the powers of the Bill will such people be forced to do jobs that demean them, such as working in a shop or serving at McDonald's? The hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell), pointed out last Thursday that working as a cleaner or working at McDonald's was perfectly honourable work. I responded that I had done that kind of work myself; there is nothing wrong in it for students or young people, and it is good experience. But it is humiliating for someone who has served out his working life and has acquired skills to be forced to work in McDonald's or as a cleaner or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is one of the job opportunities in Birkenhead. People do it, and do so willingly, but they have no illusion that it is an ennobling role. I know of mothers who work the late shift at McDonald's. It closes at midnight, and the police have to push the drunks out. They then have to clean up. The Minister will doubtless want to check that with McDonald's and the police in Birkenhead. Those women return home after 1 am, alone through the streets of Birkenhead. They willingly do that in an effort to make a contribution to the family's budget, but they have no illusions about the nature of the job or how they are being treated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the annual turnover of labour in McDonald's across the nation is about 250 per cent. which suggests that there is something wrong with that organisation and the way it treats its staff. That is an extraordinarily high turnover, and it suggests that it is a bad employer. Many people currently accept those jobs, not because it is dignified employment but because the alternatives are worse.<br><br>
Under the Bill, people who consider that such work is unsuitable and unbearable and that it does not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
allow them to use the skills that they have acquired in a lifetime of work will be forced to take that kind of job.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) mentioned men who had worked in the shipyards for years. When they were made redundant they tried to acquire further training to make their skills more flexible. Under the Bill they would be forced to take a cleaning job paying less than £1 an hour. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is no good Conservative Members shaking their heads or suggesting that that is improbable. Without some undertakings about what the regulations will say about levels of income, the age of workers and skill levels, that is the prospect which we face. That is not an exaggeration. People outside and the Government have no idea of how angry people will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is there not also another angle? What about the hurt that people feel when presented with such choices? They may have an impeccable employment record and be anxious to return to work. When they are bullied, as they will be under the Bill, they will feel that their efforts and their contribution to society are meaningless. A person can be knocked around the pushed into employment. Of course I accept that there are some scallywags. There are fallen creatures, and we want to deal with such people. The Minister never gives us a sense of keeping a balance between dealing with the scallywag and protecting and promoting the dignity of those with an impeccable working record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I see significant numbers of older men in the west midlands who have worked for a lifetime and are now unemployed. They have been hurt and bruised and let down by society. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that the regulations will make some provision on the level of remuneration. Whereas, formerly, people who needed and sought full-time work could be required to do only full-time work, they are now being required to do part-time work. They face the prospect of being required to take a job that will pay less then benefit. The Minister would not accept our amendment to correct that provision. This is an extraordinary serious matter. If the Minister does not provide for levels of remuneration in the regulations the wording of the Bill will make it illegal to take them into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The thrust of one major provision of the Bill is that levels of pay should be taken into account neither in deciding what is suitable employment, nor, by extension, in deciding what constitutes good cause. I give no undertaking that we shall introduce them into the regulations.<br><br>
We have debated levels of remuneration under previous amendments, and I do not wish to weary the Committee by going over that ground again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To try to help the Minister, I remind him that clause 9(2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"subject to any such regulations, in determining … whether a person does or does not have good cause… there shall be disregarded any matter relating to the level of remuneration".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0292">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 487</span>
The Bill specifically empowers the Minister to put in the regulations information about levels of remuneration. I simply ask him to say what he has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady may be seeking simply to reverse the thrust of the latter part of subsection (2). I am not a lawyer, thank heaven, but I understand that the first part of the subsection says what the regulations may take into account. However, it goes on to say that, subject to those regulations,
<br><blockquote><p>"there shall be disregarded any matter relating to the level of remuneration in the employment in question."</p></blockquote>
That makes it abundantly clear that it is to be disregarded. That is the thrust of other provisions in the Bill in different circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is being slip-shod. The notes on clause 9(2) say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The revised subsection provides that regulations may specify the matters which are or are not to be taken into account in determining whether a claimant has good cause for refusing a vacancy. It also provides that the level of remuneration will be regarded as such a matter, except as provided in regulations."</p></blockquote>
That is the meaning of the Bill, and it is spelt out in the notes on clauses, yet the Minister says that I am misreading the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One circumstance in which the regulations might touch on the level of remuneration is when a rate of pay would be a factor in deciding good cause in relation to jobs other than those handled by the employment service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Say it again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 9, regulations would provide that the rate of pay would be a factor in deciding good cause in relation to jobs other than those handled by the employment service.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Someone who turns down a job offered to him privately at a derisory wage should not be disqualified from unemployment benefit. Such a job offer may not even come to the employment service's attention, but, if a disgruntled employer were to telephone and say that someone had turned down a job and it turned out that the level of pay was derisory, that would not be a reason for disqualifying the person from unemployment benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings us back to the Keith Joseph "long-stop"—what the hell does derisory mean? It will vary according to the individual and his circumstances. Unless derisory means that someone will be worse off than when he receives unemployment benefit, it is meaningless.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is an absurd proposition that we should attempt to describe in regulations what the level of remuneration should be in a variety of jobs and regions.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not what the Minister is being asked; he is being asked to give a long-stop. Nobody can define derisory, but the regulations can say that people should actively seek work, they can describe the penalties which people will incur if they do not do so, and can guarantee that people will not be pushed into jobs that will make them worse off than when they were drawing the dole.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is returning again to an amendment that the Committee has already rejected in other circumstances. When I used the word "derisory", I was not suggesting that it would be used in regulations. I was trying to explain why the regulations would, exceptionally, touch on remuneration levels.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a recent case in the west midlands, a chap left his job because he was asked to work 70 hours a week for £80. Would the Minister consider that derisory?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to get involved in arguments about levels of remuneration in different occupations and regions.<br><br>
It is honestly not our intention that claimants will be expected to take unsuitable jobs. The idea that professional people will be asked to take jobs for which their skills, background and experience are totally unsuited is a fantasy. In due course, the employment market will tighten, not only in London and the south-east but in all parts of the country. It will be in the interests of the employment service and employers to ensure that the available skills and experience are put to the best possible use.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not see our difficulty? We are simply voicing the difficulties that our constituents will have. The Minister tries to explain how the Bill will work, and then gives an example about derisory pay. When we push him about the term "derisory", his argument falls apart. He then hops on to the next bit of his argument and says that claimants will not be expected to take unsuitable jobs. What does he mean by unsuitable? As you reminded us, Mr. Winterton, our debates are not just for private consumption but will be read outside the Committee and will help to determine how the Bill will operate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is aside from the matter of remuneration. Many factors can be taken into account when deciding whether a job is suitable, such as conditions of employment or an individual's physical capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Who will judge whether a person's physical capabilities are suitable for a job?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The independent adjudication authority will be in charge of making judgments on that and a range of other issues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: People will lose benefit while waiting for that decision to be made.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0293">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the decision were likely to be negative, they would lose benefit. This debate is beginning to resemble a game of ping pong. I have explained the only reason why the regulation would touch on the levels of remuneration. I have explained the background of what the clause would achieve. I have also explained why the Committee should reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Minister has just said is interesting, particularly because it contrasts with the picture that he has painted throughout our debates. It is in clear agreement with what the Opposition have been saying.<br><br>
The Minister said that the notes on clauses, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) drew attention, mean that remuneration could be taken into account only when deciding whether someone should be disqualified for turning down a job offered by someone other than the employment department. When pressed, the Minister said that he is worried that someone may be offered a job privately for a wage that even officers in the employment service would consider derisory. My hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) then asked the question that immediately came to all our minds: "How would they know?"<br><br>
The Minister talks to us about fantasy, but surely it has occurred to the Department that a "disgruntled employer"—to use the Minister's words—might tip off the Department that he offered someone a job and that it was rejected. After consideration, the Department might decide that it was not really a job.<br><br>
The Minister is also telling us that it will make no difference if a person—disgruntled or otherwise—is prepared to offer a job for derisory wages and is smart enough to place the job advertisement with the jobcentre. As the Minister has identified clearly to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short), the level of pay will be a factor only in the circumstances of a derisory pay offer by private means. It will not be a factor in all other circumstances. As long as people are brazen enough to offer jobs for absolutely ludicrous wages through jobcentres there will be no defence in the Bill for an individual who might have his willingness to seek work tested by being asked to apply for such jobs.<br><br>
Officers of the Department of Employment may be so sure that people are not actively seeking work that they are prepared to press them to a ludicrous point, not by saying "There is a job here that pays 10p an hour," but by asking, "If you are offered a job for wages as low as 10p an hour, would you take it?" If a claimant says, "No, like hell I would," an officer can rule that that claimant is not actively seeking work. We all know that the Minister does not believe that that can happen and that such officers are not employed by the Department. I have no doubt that the will accuse us again of fantasy, but it is a fantasy that the Bill makes possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take up my hon. Friend's point about how arbitrary the word "derisory" will be. The Minister assured us that there were wonderful jobs
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
in Birkenhead jobcentre for over £2 an hour. Yet, when Dave Christian goes in on Monday morning there is one job with hours from 8.30 am to 5 pm—well over eight hours a day—for £35 a week. Presumably, the Minister would consider such wages derisory. It would not be held against my constituents if that offer been made privately to someone—under the Minister's interpretation of the Bill—but, because it is in the jobcentre, it is not derisory; it is a public declaration of a suitable job. That is why we press the Minister. It is unsatisfactory for him to say that he has dealt with that point in previous parts of the Bill. It has not been dealt with adequately in our previous discussions and, that is why we must return to it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. Clearly the Minister is reluctant to give any definition of the word "derisory" apart from saying that it would be a different matter in different parts of the country. My hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead was not able to be with us on Thursday afternoon, but, had he been here, he would have got the clear impression that the Minister was saying that he had been exaggerating or, at best, was inaccurate to suggest that wages as low as £1 an hour might be on offer. The Minister gave that clear impression.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He was deriding him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The Minister was deriding the idea that that level of wages is on offer. Of course it is on offer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to mention the differences within different regions, but the Minister's skilful homework shows us the differences in one region within a few days. He can assure us that there are no jobs at £1 an hour, but someone may go in a few days later and find one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I need add nothing to that.<br><br>
The amendments have been valuable because, once again, it has become clear that, whatever assurances the Minister gives, he is living in a fantasy world. He says that it is a fantasy that people will be forced to take unsuitable jobs. The Minister's fantasy world does not mind what the law, the Secretary of State for Employment or the Secretary of State for Social Security say. Most Conservative Back Benchers seem to think that everybody who is unemployed is willfully work-shy, but let us forget that. In the Minister's fantasy world—in which Disraeli was probably the Prime Minister—no law operates as it is written on the statute book, but it operates in a way that well-meaning and kindly administrators and politicians wish it to. That is not how the Bill will work, and that is why we oppose it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend consider that she may have done Disraeli an injustice? Given his ideas about strengthening the power of working people to negotiate their wage rates, he would not have supported some of the Government's actions which undermine them.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, and far be it from me to cast any slurs on Disraeli. Indeed, his influence would be welcome in today's Conservative party. However, it is far from evident.<br><br>
The debate has been useful and has shown how much more accurate our description of the legislation is than the description with which we have been fed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate. In many cases, the Minister has confused, rather than enlightened, the Committee. Someone said that the Minister had painted a picture, but that picture has been painted in watercolours during a rainstorm. The more he paints the picture, the bigger the mess. The Committee is confused, so God help people outside who will have to implement the Bill and make judgments.<br><br>
It is remarkable that levels of pay can be as low as possible, provided that they go through the jobcentres. Jobcentres will become a bargain basement for bad employers and poor payers. If they want to get a bargain and hire a slave, they can go to jobcentres. That is incredible. Therefore, it is essential that we have some regulation and protection. The Minister reacts with apparent glee to the fact that nothing in the Bill will protect a client from being exploited by an employer.<br><br>
We are not saying that all people who get jobs should become millionaires overnight—we shall leave that to the London yuppies. People should at least have decent pay for the hours that they work and the conditions with which they put up.<br><br>
I am still not convinced that enough consideration has been given to conditions. How does an officer judge a person with a nervous disposition? I do not know how a person proves it that he has a nervous disposition, but if he is of a nervous disposition he can hardly be expected to work as a labourer in the bottom of a slag pit, under an arc furnace. Nor could he be expected to work on a crane truck. Who will judge whether such people are swinging the lead? Many Conservative Members are inexperienced and have never known what it is like to work for a living in such circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Work for a living, period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right.<br><br>
These are crucial issues. I have spent most of my working life in engineering and heavy steel. I was often nervous working 30ft up, with blast furnaces pumping stuff out all over the place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with some sympathy to the hon. Gentleman, but it is difficult to prescribe in advance for every instance. Some yuppies have just lost well-paid jobs in the City. Is it reasonable to say that an extraordinarily well-paid yuppie should be able to sit around waiting for another well-paid yuppie job to come along? It is impossible to prescribe in advance for every situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not the point. Before the measure becomes law, we need an assurance about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
the implications for people who will face the tribunals and adjudication officers.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the framework of the existing law for the well-paid yuppies who are currently losing their jobs in the City is that for three months they may look for a well-paid yuppie job? After that, they are expected to widen their horizons and take any job that is available, provided that the employer pays the going rate paid by any decent employer in the area. That deals with the problem that the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) raised. But the Bill provides for the abolition of the notions of "suitable" and of a decent going rate for the area.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point that my hon. Friend has made. I do not mind if we get one or two yuppies in industry but, frankly, some of their activities would make them a liability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee, but I wish to underline how significant this series of exchanges has been. The Minister has told us that he will not use the powers that he is given by the Bill to lay down any standards of minimum income for people who will otherwise be deprived of their benefit and forced into a job, except in the case of a private employment agency offering a derisory rate. He made it clear that he was not using the word "derisory" in a legal sense.<br><br>
We are looking forward—or, rather, we are not looking forward—to the prospect that the wages councils will be abolished. There will be no minimum wage system of any sort, patchy as the current one is. Therefore, any wage, at any level—no matter how derisory—that is offered to the jobcentre will have to be advertised there. The only offer that the Minister will make to us is that people cannot get a job paying a derisory rate from a private employment agency, but, as soon as the wages councils have been abolished, they can get a job paying a derisory rate from a jobcentre because it will have no basis to refuse such advertisements.<br><br>
Conditions are important. We do not want young people to be in dangerous occupations and at risk of death and injury such as in the horrible case in Sheffield of Derek Cain, who finished up in a threshing machine. That is all to do with someone being forced into a YTS sort of scheme. It is important that we learn those lessons and do not expect adjudicating officers to understand all those situations unless we have some guidance from the Government.<br><br>
The Minister mentioned that having to travel for up to one hour would not be a good cause for turning down a job. Would that apply to the disabled?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I specifically said that disability would be taken into account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whatever that disability may be, it will again be a matter of judgment. Therefore, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0295">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
have another vagueness, but at least we are part of the way there. I am still not clear whether travel costs would be good cause for refusing a job. We need to know clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I draw my hon. Friend's attention to an earlier intervention that suggested that someone who had lost a well-paid job in the City should, therefore, accept any job. By and large, that principle would be accepted. However, a person who had lost a high-paid job should not be expected to be offered a job at £2 an hour, on which he or she would find it extremely difficult to manage. Are Conservative Members going to deride people who lose their jobs and say, "No matter where they worked before, we shall laugh at them and leave them to their fate"? That is the impression that I get. No one who is offered a job at that level should be denied the right to benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. The sort of minimum standards of decent employment conditions and wages that I believe should be available should extend to unemployed yuppies, just as they should extend to unemployed male workers in manufacturing and unemployed women cleaners. I am looking for minimum decent standards of employment conditions that will project everyone.<br><br>
The Minister has made clear the Government's frightening determination to make no provision for levels of renumeration. He has refused to put into the regulations, in the one place where the Bill gives him the power to do so, some standards of minimum renumeration. We know that jobs are constantly being advertised in jobcentres offering wages that are illegal under the wages council system. That happens time and again and local law centres and low pay units expose it and ask for assurances from the Government that jobs are illegal rates of pay will not continue to be advertised. The Government say that they will do their best and then we find another breach. Once the Government have abolished the wages councils—and it is clear that that is their shameful plan—those rates of pay will not be illegal; there will nothing to stop them being offered.<br><br>
I do not want to repeat myself indefinitely, but the loss of the word "suitable" will put people who are seeking full-time work in a position where they might be forced to accept part-time jobs. People might be forced to accept minute levels of income and when the Minister gives us assurances that his officials will not behave unreasonably, I am afraid that they are false.<br><br>
I refer him to the examples provided by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux of decisions to stop people's benefits. The first case states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Client undertook a course of instruction to familiarise himself with computers."</p></blockquote>
Obviously he really wanted work and went off to do a course to increase his chances. It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"He joined the course with the intention of increasing his employment prospects. When the course finished our client 'signed-on' and completed form UB671—saying he would prefer to work with computers. UB suspended because client has 'restricted his availability for work'."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
What a disgrace. Someone is unemployed, goes on a course to learn about computers because he thinks that that is the technology of the future, and simply because he puts down that he would prefer to work with computers, he is charged with restricted employability and has his unemployment benefit suspended. That has happened under existing provisions, not the much tighter provisions provided for under the Bill.<br><br>
Case number two states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Client left work after pressure from the Manager of a retail shop. The Manager wished him to perform dishonest tasks, eg client encouraged to 'falsify' delivery sheets so they recorded 'short' deliveries."</p></blockquote>
The individual was being required by the employer to be dishonest, to lie and to cheat. The client refused, lost his job and had his unemployment benefit suspended—under the existing regulations. I do not know why the Minister looks so exasperated; is that not a disgrace?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is only that the same brief was read out by another hon. Member in another sitting. The hon. Lady is just repeating it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister might think that the examples are only worthy of being read once. They are highly relevant to the assurances that he has given us. He said that the Opposition are raising false alarms. Reasonable officials would not do such unreasonable things. Does not the Minister think that it is unreasonable that someone should have his unemployent benefit stopped because he refused to be dishonest? Should the state help the employer to force someone to be dishonest? The other example that was referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray), who has now left the Room, was of someone who took a job in a supermarket at basic wage council rates but then found that he was expected to work for up to 10 hours weekly overtime without pay. He gave up the job and was disqualified from unemployment benefit.<br><br>
We aleady have a framework in which people are unreasonably penalised, and have their benefit stopped. Much greater powers are now being taken to stop people's benefit and any system of regulation of suitable employment, hours of work and level of remuneration is being wiped away. People will be forced by threat of penury into accepting jobs at very low levels of pay with appalling employment conditions. That is the Minister's intention and he has sat here this morning and refused to promise us any regulation on levels of remuneration.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 99, in page 6, line 29, leave out "during the permitted period".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>Amendment No. 105, in page 6, line 45, after "period", insert
<br><blockquote><p>"not being less than twenty-six weeks".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment No. 68, in page 7, line 1, leave out "and longest".</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to ease the rigidities that have been slipped into the cause. It would remove the power to set a maximum permitted period during which an unemployed person could refuse a job offer without being disqualified from benefit.<br><br>
My hon. Friend mentioned earlier the references that appear in the margin of the Bill. Clause 9(3) comes under a separate heading:
<br><blockquote><p>"Exemptions from disqualification for unemployment benefit."</p></blockquote>
The subsection says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in section 20 above or in regulations under that section shall be taken to disqualify a person for receiving unemployment benefit by reason only of his refusal—
<br><blockquote><p>(a) to seek or accept employment in a situation which is vacant in consequence of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute; or"—</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
and, more significant to the amendment—
<br><blockquote><p>"(b) to seek or accept during the permitted period any employment other than employment in his usual occupation at a level of remuneration not lower than he is accustomed to receive."</p></blockquote>
I paused to underline the phrase, "during the permitted period", because it is inserted into the Bill under a heading,
<br><blockquote><p>"Exemptions from disqualification for unemployment benefit".</p></blockquote>
It is not an exemption but an inclusion for disqualification. Once again, the Government have set the provision on its head by suggesting that there is an exemption when the words in the Bill mean that there is an inclusion.<br><br>
You would rule me out of order, Mr. Winterton, if I were to list the occasions on which the Government have spoken of rights and choice when they have actually taken away choice and denied rights. They have a habit of using language inversely to obtain the opposite meaning. The Minister may feel that he can give warm, cosy assurances that everything will be all right at the time, but we are discussing hard-edged legislation. Rigidities built into the Bill will mean that people will pay the price in their daily lives when the law is operated in practice. We cannot rely on the Minister's assurances, not because of the reasons that he gives but because we must rely on his word and he may no longer be the Minister when the Bill is enacted.<br><br>
I heard commitments by the Minister in the Committee examining the Housing Bill, for example.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
I seem to recall that you, Mr. Winterton, chaired some of the Committee's sittings. The Minister's assurances reappeared on Report and he promised to write them into the Bill later. Those assurances could effectively stand for nothing because he could have moved on and his successor might not stand by the commitments he gave. We cannot be expected to rely on the Minister's words in Committee: we have to go on the Bill itself and the regulations.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
The new section 20A that will be inserted into the 1975 Act allows a claimant to refuse employment other than in his usual occupation, or at a lower level of pay then he is used to, without being disqualified for unemployment benefit, but only "during the permitted period". Our amendment, by deleting those words, would remove the time limit and allow claimants to refuse indefinitely to accept other low-paid work.<br><br>
At present after a certain time, which can vary from case to case, employment other than in a person's usual occupation can be regarded as suitable if the pay and conditions are not below the agreed and generally recognised standard. There is no maximum period at present during which a claimant can insist on seeking work only in his usual occupation. That is why we resist this change in the law. The phrase "during the permitted period" adds an additional coercive force to the Bill which ought not to be there.<br><br>
Under the new rule, the length of the permitted period will vary with the circumstances of the case. We must thank the Government for the notes on clauses as they reveal the real intention of the Bill. They state:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is intended that the 'permitted period' will not exceed thirteen weeks."</p></blockquote>
That must mean that in most cases it will be considerably less than 13 weeks. In reality at the end of the permitted period, claimants will be in a much worse position than now, because the rate of pay will no longer be taken into account in deciding whether they have good cause for refusing or failing to apply for a job.<br><br>
The Minister may reply that the amendment would mean that people could continue to draw unemployment benefit or income support indefinitely without lowering their sights. That is not the case. If a person tried to do that he would be caught either by the availability condition or by the "actively seeking employment" test. A belt and braces approach is already available without adding the phrase "during the permitted period". The unemployed person ought at least to have the right to argue for a longer period to search for work in his usual occupation, and a right of appeal if that is refused. Will the Minister confirm that without our amendment it will not be possible to argue for a permitted period of more than 13 weeks? Presumably, that limit will be laid in the regulations and cast in wrought iron behind the Bill. It is important for people to know where they stand.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0297">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
The effect of amendment No. 105 would be that the permitted period during which a claimant could refuse employment other than in his usual occupation would be at least 26 weeks. The Government's proposal is that the period should be fixed case by case by the adjudication officer, in accordance with regulations, but the maximum, which will be laid down in the regulations, would be 13 weeks. If the maximum is 13 weeks, most people will presumably be allowed a much shorter period before they are expected to take any job that is going, however badly paid. If the Minister insists on a permitted period, and this is obviously a backstop to amendment No. 99, will he ensure that that period would be at least 26 weeks?<br><br>
The permitted period is to be fixed in each case by the adjudication officer. The clause will give the Secretary of State a power to prescribe a maximum and a minimum period. Amendment No. 68 tries to circumscribe the Secretary of State's power. On one occasion the Minister accepted that and we were grateful. The amendment would remove the power to prescribe a maximum period from the Secretary of State. The Government have already announced their intention to make the maximum period 13 weeks. Why does the Secretary of State need the power if the maximum will be built into the regulations? That is a contradiction. Our amendment would leave it to adjudication officers to fix the limit in each case without any arbitrary maximum.<br><br>
On the last group of amendments, the Minister appealed for flexibility. If he is not prepared to accept this group of amendments, it demonstrates that he is pulling in the opposite direction and is increasing the rigidities in the Bill. I shall be interested to hear his response to our proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak to amendment No. 105. I apologise for not being here for the earlier part of our proceedings, but I have been at an important meeting about the shortage of affordable housing for rent in my constituency—there is no shortage of houses.<br><br>
I speak to amendment No. 105 in place of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) who would have spoken to it because it concerns acting and Equity. Unfortunately, he cannot be here because of his father's illness, and we understand that.<br><br>
I support the amendment because my constituency has a long tradition of being a place where many actors live. They used to live in Islington because housing was cheap, in the days of music halls and Ealing comedies. Now, they live there because it is expensive and therefore a nice place to live, or at least parts of it are.<br><br>
We are dealing with the amount of time that people require to be able to find suitable work to accommodate their special needs. Contrary to popular belief, members of the acting profession spend most of their time unemployed. Most of those in work are on low wages. Roughly 40 per cent. of Equity's membership—which is most of those in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
professional acting—have an annual income of less than £5,000. It is a fallacy that there are thousands of wealthy actors and actresses, but that is perpetrated by popular press reports about the lifestyles of a tiny minority of film or theatre actors. I am sure that that is well understood.<br><br>
We are moving the amendment because if a theatre run, pantomime or film ends, an actor or actress cannot just move into another job straight away. A lot of searching and setting up is required. Actors and actresses cannot just move from one job to another.<br><br>
Most employment in entertainment is of short duration. The average run for plays outside London is short. A repertory run would only be a few weeks. At best, the pantomime season would run for four or five weeks, possible eight or ten if it is a particularly good one. Even seaside summer shows do not run for a long period, because they may be unattractive or unsuccessful. Therefore, there are often breaks in employment. During periods of employment, actors and actresses must look for work. That is difficult because they may be contracted to complete the run of a play. One of my neighbours has had a long, successful run in "Easy Virtue" at the Garrick theatre. She did very well, but unfortunately, she could not accept any other parts that she was offered because she was contracted to be in the play until the end of its run. People in the acting profession must make the difficult judgment whether a run is likely to end at a time when it will be convenient for them to find other work.<br><br>
The other problem concerns the changes in public taste and the fluctuations in the sort of work that actors and actresses can do. I mentioned music hall earlier. Anyone trying to make a living as a music hall artist these days will be lucky to find any work at all, apart from appearing on "The Good Old Days" when it is running. Although some people in the profession can change their style of acting to fit into different roles, when public taste changes, it becomes difficult for actors and actresses to get a particular part. Those problems should be considered and accepted by the Government.<br><br>
Another problem that actors and actresses have is one that we all face. They must get work which is consistent with their age, physical appearance, voice, and so on. Unfortunately, like politicians and the rest of humanity, actors and actresses suffer from the problem of getting older. Our appearance changes as we get older. An actor of 65 who suffers from rheumatism cannot keep playing an athletic James Bond. It would not look good for someone to jump in and out of speed boats and fly planes if he needed a stick to help him do it. It would be like expecting me to perform on television as a tenor singer: my voice was never very good and now it is awful. There are problems in the profession which must be understood.<br><br>
If actors and actresses develop particular expertise or professional ability, they must look for suitable plays set in their specific period. It is no good being a Shakespearean actor if there is no Shakespeare
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0298">Image</span>
