</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I ask the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) to resume her remarks, I draw the Committee's attention to a note at the top of the Amendment Paper, which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any late Amendments will appear in a separate Paper."</p></blockquote>
The Amendment Paper contains all amendments that were tabled up to 8 o'clock last night. Any amendments subsequently tabled will appear in a separate Amendment Paper. In that event, however, they would be starred, and therefore most unlikely to be called for debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will briefly recap the riveting debate of Tuesday morning. We are discussing earnings factors, and the amendments offer the Government a variety of formulae to restrict the power that they seek to give themselves in Clause 3, which we consider rather too wide.'<br><br>
Amendment No. 7 seeks to delete the words "in general", in order to make sure that whatever tables are produced as a consequence of the clause give at least approximately the right answer, not just any old answer. Amendment No. 8 introduces a more definite requirement for an earnings factor that does not involve an unacceptable risk of depriving people of benefit earned by contributions, so that the earnings factor derived under the clause should be at least equal to the earnings on which contributions were paid. I was in the throes of describing amendment No. 9, which is the regulation-making power.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
One of the main points arising on amendment No. 9, which will possibly arise elsewhere, is the Government's increasing tendency to give themselves powers to make regulations that can be widely drawn, and that fail to come under the scrutiny of this House as do matters that are written into primary legislation. It is a matter of concern in principle, and should be to all good parliamentarians, when Governments seek to give themselves powers that will not be exposed to full scrutiny. Past experience shows that, unfortunately, this has led to considerable problems when, through haste, inefficiency, or incapacity, the Government have made regulations not only defective in carrying out their intentions, but defective in law. Regulations, as the law stands at present, cannot be amended. That, too, is a matter to which we might later direct our attention.<br><br>
This procedure means that, when the Government put regulations before the House, we can only accept or reject them in whole. There is no opportunity to tighten or improve them, or, indeed, as may sometimes be necessary, to correct them. If the Government admit before the regulations' passage in law—which is not always the case—that they have made a mistake, they may have to withdraw them and go through the whole process again from to start to finish, a waste of parliamentary and Government time.<br><br>
Our main concern is the way in which so much is now put in regulations. So far, I have not had the happy experience of seeing even one set of regulations in draft before the Bill giving them effect has passed through all its stages in House. That means that the Government are given a blank cheque. The amendment seeks to limit what the Secretary of State is giving himself the powers to do.<br><br>
The subsection which the clause would insert in section 13 of the 1975 Act is more widely drawn than is necessary to put right the mistakes in the original legislation. It would enable the Secretary of State to make regulations limiting anyone's earnings factor for any year, for any reasons whatsoever. Although I feel confident that the Under-Secretary will tell us that that is not the Government's intention, it would allow the Government to cut benefit, simply by making a decision through regulations to limit the earnings factor. If the Government do not intend to give themselves the power to adopt this backstairs route of cutting benefit, there is no need for them to take such a power. I hope that the Under-Secretary will tell us that they will give careful consideration to this as well as to our other arguments.<br><br>
The risk of people's earnings factors being inflated because they have more than one job^ which is the ground stated in the notes on clauses for the Government seeking this power, is only one side of the picture. The other side is that people may run the risk of paying more contributions than they should. The DSS leaflet No. NP28, "More Than One Job", explains that overpayments of less than £20 are not automatically refunded. Indeed, such is the accuracy of the system of recording used that the DSS may not even know that contributions have been overpaid.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0049">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
The leaflet gives claimants the kind of helpful advice that, as we all know, our constituents find so easy to follow, such as:
<br><blockquote><p>"You should ask your social security office to check your contributions if you think you have paid more than the annual maximum and</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>you have paid contributions in more than one job"</p></blockquote>
It draws the attention of the claimant to whether one or more of those jobs was in contracted-out employment or in non-contracted-out employment.<br><br>
<br><blockquote><p>"as a mariner or in HM Forces from which your earnings were less than £100 a week (£434 a month or £5,200 a year)"</p></blockquote>
You will recognise immediately, Mr. Winterton, how easy our constituents find it to follow helpful leaflets of this kind, and to pursue these questions with the DSS—never mind getting and answer. Even though it is a good thing that leaflets offering some instruction are available, it is likely that the instructions have not resulted in a flood of applications for refunds. It is certainly not clear whether the problem of overpaid contributions has been, or will be, solved by the changes proposed in clause 3.<br><br>
Our main concern, however, is that the regulations, as they are proposed, will give far wider powers to the Secretary of State than any that can be justified by the problem that it is claimed that the clause seeks to address. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some reassurance on that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 10 suggests that nothing in the clause should result in a reduction of a person's earnings factors that have already been notified to that person. The Government say that clause 3 is a tidying-up excercise to bring the law into line with existing practice, but we are concerned to ensure that it does not go further and deprive people of benefit entitlements that they have been led to expect, particularly in respect of contributions paid in 1987-88. Some of its provisons seem to be backdated to early April 1987. That is an unnecessary use of the Government's powers, because whatever problems may result will presumably be relatively minor and, if the Department has got the law right this time, will be corrected in future.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will tell us that they are prepared to consider some of our arguments for these constructive and probing amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said at the beginning of her remarks at the last sitting—that earnings factors are complex, even arcane. However, I make no complaint that she probes these matters. They are of fundamental importance because upon. them are based the individual's entitlement to short and long-term contributory benefits. Indeed, they are the building blocks of the system, so I am happy that the hon. Lady questioned the rules asset out or modified in the clause.<br><br>
The hon. Lady, as is her wont, reminisced about 1985-86 and, in particular, the changes that took place in October 1985 when my right hon. Friend the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced differential rates of contribution—5, 7 and 9 per cent. An individual could pay any of these rates, or a combination of them; and this introduced a note of complexity. That change, as I am sure the hon. Lady will readily concede, was to improve the position of the lower paid, but as a by-product of that change, it was no longer feasible to continue calculating earnings factors from contributions. Therefore, in the tax years 1985–86 and 1986–87, we had two years of complicated formulae when in practice there was a tendency to overstate earnings factors, particularly at the top end of the income bracket.<br><br>
Therefore, from 1987, employers have been required to keep a record of earnings on which their employees have paid national insurance contributions. Regrettably, a small number have either failed to keep that information or have recorded it incorrectly. The primary intention of the clause is to enable the Department to compute an earnings factor where correct information has not been supplied by the employer. Unless we can do this, individuals will not receive the benefit to which they are entitled. At the same time, we are taking the opportunity to put right, as the hon. Lady has identified, the unintended removal of section 13(5)(a) of the Social Security Act 1975.<br><br>
Amendment No. 7 seeks to make the computation of earnings factors more precise. As the hon. Lady mentioned, this is a tidying-up exercise to restore the position to that which applied from 1975 to 1986. The Social Security Act 1986 inadvertently removed section 13(5)(a) of the 1975 Act. We now seek to remedy that. The only change to the 1975 Act, passed by a labour Government, will be to the derivation of class 1 earnings because of the differential rates of contribution introduced in October 1985.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to ensure that the Department uses exact figures when calculating earnings factors. If accepted, it would not allow us to compute, as proposed in the second part of the clause, an earnings factor for an individual whose employer has not provided the correct information. Some individuals would therefore lose out, and I am sure that the hon. Lady does not intend that. That is why I cannot recommend my hon. Friends to accept the amendment. I hope that on those grounds, the hon. Lady will not wish to press it. She attached her remarks to the words "in general". She thought that that was something of a blank cheque, but it is no more of a blank cheque than the provisions in the 1975 Act from which it is lifted.<br><br>
Secondly, it is more necessary now because we cannot calculate each individual's entitlement on precise figures. We need a guide and umbrella that says that, in general, we will do this, but also gives an opportunity when this cannot be done to do it in another way and as accurately as possible.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
Amendment No. 8 requires the calculation of earnings factors to be more generous, changing "equal or approximating to" to
<br><blockquote><p>"equal to or more than".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0050">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 47</span>
As I have explained, clause 3 is a tidying-up clause to restore the position as closely as possible to that in the 1975 Act. The amendment, however, would change that and make the calculation of earnings factors more generous. This would increase the additional pension that individuals receive, so they would benefit in the long run.<br><br>
The clause is not, however, the correct way to improve or change entitlement and the system on which SERPS has been based since its introduction. Nor do I accept that there is a need for change to make the system fairer between individuals, as the hon. Lady implied. I picked that up from a number of her remarks. Under the system that operated under the Labour Government, which we are seeking to reproduce as closely as possible, all individuals were treated the same.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Lady will see that the amendment is not desirable and that if a change is sought, to provide more generous earnings factors for individuals across the board, this is not the way to do it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 9 narrows the scope of the clause to individuals <br><blockquote><p>"with two or more concurrent employments."</p></blockquote>
It would restrict the scope of what we intend to people with two jobs. It is possible for people who are doing two jobs at the same time and who contribute at the lower rate to have, on paper, a higher earnings factor than a person with one employment but the same total earnings. By tabling this amendment, the hon. Lady recognised that discrepancy and wished to deal with it. The clause as drafted, however, does deal with it. Our purpose was to go wider; the hon. Lady narrows that purpose—I think unintentionally. We wanted to ensure that any unusual work or pay circumstances do not lead to individuals having higher earnings factors than people with one employment or one payment but the same total earnings.<br><br>
I am thinking of a person who is paid on a four-weekly basis, but who receives payments for overtime on a different cycle—perhaps mid-monthly. It cannot be equitable for individuals in such circumstances to be able to achieve a higher earnings factor than an individual who has the same total earnings, but from one employment, or who receives his overtime along with his monthly pay. We wish to tackle this wider opportunity for unfairness between individuals.<br><br>
Although we agree with the purpose of the hon. Lady's amendment, it would make it impossible for us to achieve this wider fairness. I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Lady will not press it; if she does, I shall ask my hon. Friends to reject it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 10 would have the effect of perpetuating errors after they had been discovered. The hon. Lady is aware that from April 1987 employers have been required to keep a record of earnings on which their employees have paid national insurance contributions. The information is needed in order to calculate a person's entitlement to contributory benefits—sickness and unemployment benefit, the basic state retirement pension and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 48</span>
additional pension. A small number of employers have either failed to record the information or they have got it wrong. The intention of the clause is to enable the Department to compute an earnings factor, where correct information has not been supplied by the employer, which is as close to the employee's actual earnings as is mathematically possible.<br><br>
The effect of the hon. Lady's amendment would be to allow an employee whose employer had incorrectly recorded his earnings at too high a level—for instance, earnings above the upper earnings limit on which contributions had not been paid by the employee—to have a higher earnings factor and thus a higher benefit level than an employee who had the same level of earnings which was correctly recorded by his employer.<br><br>
I want to assure the Committee that we keep our records in such a way that we can identify whether the earnings factor has been computed in this way. If, as a result of incorrect recording by an employer, an individual's benefit is overpaid, we shall not seek to recover any of that benefit. We shall, however, be able to change the earnings factor—up or down, as appropriate, and as accurately as new information allows—if new information comes to light. This seems to be the fairest way between individuals. I hope that the hon. Lady and other members of the Committee will agree.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Battle <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the sensitivity to individual circumstances with which the Minister has presented the Government's case. I want only to make a brief appeal for consistency in the Government's approach.<br><br>
The Minister introduced a helpful concept when he said that we must get straight the "basic building blocks". That is right. I appreciate that it is difficult to obtain precise figures on which to base calculations; but the way in which the Government arrive at the calculations will determine people's entitlement to benefits and pensions. Therefore it has a crucial impact on their incomes.<br><br>
What I have heard from the Minister this morning differs from what I heard last night. I make no apology for raising the matter. Last night it was pointed out in the debate on child benefit that
<br><blockquote><p>"70 per cent. of the families who stand to gain from child benefit have incomes above average earnings."</p></blockquote>
Later the Secretary of State referred to
<br><blockquote><p>"average gross male earnings to April 1988—and we should remember that over 70 per cent. of potential recipients of child benefit earn more than the average—…"—<i>[Official Report,</i> 18 January 1989; Vol. 145, c. 361.]</p></blockquote>
I think that those figures were wrong. It is not true that most families earn more than the average. It is incumbent on the Government to get right the basic building blocks; but the basic building block for the poor cannot be average gross male earnings; that has an unjustly distorting effect on those on low incomes, either on low wages or pensions and benefits.<br><br>
How can the Minister be so individually sensitive in the Committee when yesterday evening he was so grossly insensitive and unfair to individuals in a specific context? The very building block on which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0051">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 49</span>
the decision is made has a distorting effect on those whom the Government claim they want to assist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I follow the point that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) seeks to make. The connection between the debate last night and this clause and the amendments to it is being stretched and strained.<br><br>
Last night we debated whether resources were better targetted on those most in need—those in the income support and family credit system—or whether it should be a flat rate benefit. There are real arguments and issues here, but they are not connected with this clause. The clause takes the existing situation and seeks to devise a system that is as accurate as possible in relation to the individual's earnings and that treats individuals in the same way within that general context.<br><br>
I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman accepted that we are trying to do this sensitively as well as accurately. I can assure him that if he deduced that from what I said, he deduced it correctly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have listened with care to what the Minister said. We realise that this is not a matter of party political controversy but of trying to get the rule right.<br><br>
Amendment No. 9 deals with the powers that the Government will have through the regulation procedure, but I am concerned that that power is too widely drawn. If the Government intend to use this power only with regard to concurrent employment, the subsection could be redrafted to do that—perhaps on Report—without giving unlimited regulation-making powers of the kind contained in the Bill. Is the Minister prepared to consider such a submission? Perhaps for once I should write to him, instead of the other way round.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may inadvertently have misled the hon. Lady. The reason I said that we could not accept the amendment was because it narrowed the scope of the clause to those with two employments; whereas I tried to illustrate that there were other circumstances in which, because of an unusual pay arrangement, someone could have a higher earnings factor on a lower level of earnings, which would not be fair between individuals.<br><br>
If the hon. Lady cares to write to me with suggestions as to how the objective, which I think we both want to achieve, can be achieved more precisely or more clearly, I should be interested. However, I think that the words "in general"—which we lifted from the 1975 Act—are part of the protection. In general we are required to do things in a specific and exact way in order to achieve that end, unless there are reasons why we must depart from the simplicity of the approach that was possible in 1975 when there was only one level at which national insurance contributions were paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We shall want to consider carefully what the Minister has said. We both agree that these are arcane matters. If, having considered the matter,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 50</span>
we remain of the view that there is a better way to do this, we shall certainly write to the Minister. I am happy to have what I think is his assurance that he will consider what we have said. We have had a short but useful debate and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mrs. Gorman, do you wish to speak? The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) seeks leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Forgive me, Mr. Winterton. We did not realise that another hon. Member wished to speak. I shall yet seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank you, Mr. Winterton, and also the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett).<br><br>
This is the last of the clauses dealing with pensions. The debates on the clauses concerning pensions reflect a certain suspicion that pensions that are controlled and regulated by the Government may well be manipulated in the future for purposes other than the interests of those who have paid in that money. The pension money which individuals pay to the state is not treated as a separate fund in the way that a normal pension programme would be treated in the private sector. Therefore I share some of the concern of the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett).<br><br>
These debates are almost the equivalent of those on councils where hours are spent discussing what colour to paint the council house doors. They are at that kind of nitpicking level. We are trying to protect citizens lest a future Government—of course, not this one—manipulates what are essentially pension funds for purposes other than pensions.<br><br>
Because our pension funds are so healthy—we are told there is a £2 billion-odd surplus—this is a good time for the Government, and even the Opposition, to consider the prospect of everything, other than the basic pension, being put out to private pension services to run.<br><br>
11 am<br><br>
I should like to bring to the Committee's attention the work of Professor Victor Morgan, whose excellent pamphlet, "Choice in Pensions", deals with many of the points made by the hon. Member for Derby, South. It would take a great deal of the burden of this kind of debate away from the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Lady tell the Committee how what she is saying relates to the amendments that we are debating? I am a little at sea.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. We are debating whether people's earnings—particularly if they are earning more in some other way—shall qualify for Government backup, which is the other half of the money that goes into the pension fund.

merely wish to point out that we could save ourselves lengthy and tedious debates if the Government would consider contracting out the whole of other than the basic pension to the private sector so that people could make their own arrangements—such as topping-up—without our having to spend hours and hours debating it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to detain the Committee by dwelling on the interesting observations made by the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman). She will know that I do not agree with them, but I am glad to learn that she shares some of our suspicions that excessive powers may be given to the Government. I hope that that means that in later debates she may be inclined to vote with us. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood <span class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is indebted to the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett). I admire the work that she has done. I am not afraid to confess, that earnings factors have always been clouded in mystery for me since the changes under the 1975 Act. As far as I can make out, earnings factors are calculated on the well known Highland OTHINE principle, which is "Och to hell, it's near enough". That has always been my worry.<br><br>
May I make a serious point in three different ways. First, the earnings factors are extremely important. We are reaching the stage at which employers are finding it, even with good faith and the best will in the world, very difficult to keep up with the changes and to do the sums that are necessary to protect contributory benefits. The excellent welfare rights groups and citizens advice bureaux worry the entrails of the social security system in order to obtain benefits for claimants. That is right and proper. But no one seems very bothered about earnings factors calculations, which are left to the Department.<br><br>
That puts a strain on employers. The Government should look carefully at the service that they provide to them—particularly to the self-employed and small business men who have enough troubles on their plates without having to burn the midnight oil to calculate earnings factors. I know that they do not have to do everything, but they have to do a certain amount of basic work. The Government do not give enough support to such people by helping them to calculate the figures.<br><br>
The departmental staff who deal with those matters deserve medals. The Government should look carefully at the resources that they are putting into some of the Departments. I know that they are anxious to cut staff at all levels, and in some cases that is justifiable. However, if they are making cuts at some departmental staff levels, they should seriously consider transferring some dedicated civil servants who work jolly hard in helping to solve some of the complicated questions—or even increasing the complement of people doing that.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 52</span>
The other group of people whom fees-earnings factors affect are the employees themselves. I have once or twice seriously tried to work out whether calculations have been right or wrong, and have given up. At the end of the day, one has to take the Department's word as the final authority, and it is not healthy when the systems calculating such important matters as earnings factors descend to such complexity. Before we leave the clause, I should like to hear the Minister say that the Department is aware of that, and that in the consolidation procedures next year, the Department will seriously consider what simplifications can be achieved, or failing that, what extra resources can be put in to make sure that we get some of these complicated sums right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) that this is a complicated subject. Those of us who have spoken about it have accepted that. It perhaps adds to the complication when some of it is described in Scottish, rather than in the English in which I have had it explained to me. He is wrong, however, to think that the complexity falls upon the employers. The complexity of the computation falls upon officials of the Department. What is required of employers is the accurate recording of the earnings on which national insurance contributions are paid, rather than the overall earnings figure. It is not complexity, but accuracy of the information that is required. Most employers understand the need for that and provide it. Some do not—hence the complexity of the clause.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman offered medals to officials in the Department, which I enthusiastically accept on their behalf, because in fact they do what he asks of them. Inspectors are available for advice and guidance. We write, make contact, assist, and explain why the records need to be kept. That is why most employers supply it in the form in which the process can be done speedily, with accuracy, and without question.<br><br>
I agree that there is never a situation that cannot be improved further. Because it has improved as much as it has, it is possible to concentrate [that much] more on those employers who are not yet getting it right. I accept what he said, but I hope that he will accept what I say, which is that the Department is well aware of it, and is taking the steps he wants taken to put the matter right.</span></p>
<p><i>Clause 3 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I am not asking you to reply today, but I should be grateful if you would consider this point. I understand that an hon. Member has complained that at the Committee's last sitting, my respected colleague Mr. Lyons—who sometimes assists Opposition Members, occupying the Press Bench, as he is entitled to do as correspondent of the <i>New Statesman</i>—from time to time passed notes to Opposition Members. As you know, Mr. Winterton, the Government have eight civil servants in the Committee Room to assist them, and I suspect that more may come in, because when we move from clause to clause, the shift
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0053">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 53</span>
changes. Since there is no red spot, or other means of identification, we cannot determine precisely how many civil servants the Government have in the Room at the time. We make no compliant about that, nor did the Committee considering the 1985 Bill complain that 50 civil servants were working full time on the Bill. We had then, as we do now, the part-time assistance of someone whom we came to call our "unofficial civil service", who is a host in himself.<br><br>
We have no wish to be out of order or to disrupt the working of the Committee, but will you consider the matter carefully, Mr. Winterton? It is easier if those who are entitled to occupy the Press Bench can pass the occasional, helpful note to members of the Committee. I should be grateful if you would consider what the procedure should be, without disrupting the Committee or going contrary to your ruling, so that we are not deprived of the small amount of assistance that is available.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Simon Burns <span class='memberconstituency'>(Chelmsford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. First, I make it plain that I did not make the complaint. Secondly, when you consider the point of order raised by the Hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett), will you take into account the following? Eleven years ago, when I was research assistant to the then hon. Member for Gloucester, Mrs. Sally Oppenheim, a Committee was considering the Price Commission Bill. The hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) was leading for the then Government and had an army of civil servants sitting at the back of the Room. The Opposition whether or not to their benefit is not for me to decide—had me as their assistant. I, too, was prevented by Members on the Government Benches from sitting on the Press Bench and passing notes to Opposition Members.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. This is not the first time that I have disagreed with my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. No one ever passes me any notes. I feel left out. The more notes that are passed, the better.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps there is a good reason why so few notes are passed to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood), I am grateful to the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) for the courteous way in which she has raised a relevant and important point of order. I shall consider it and take expert advice. However, it is inappropriate even for members of this Committee to turn round in their seats to communicate with members of the press occupying the Press Bench. I hope that that establishes part of the point at issue, bearing in mind that Mr. Lyons is highly respected, a considerable expert on social security matters and a member of the press. This matter is of special relevance and I shall take advice and consider it sympathetically.<br><br>
We now move to clause 4. <i>[Interruption.]</i> As hon. Members can see, there is now a change in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 54</span>
civil servants on duty. The hon. Lady must have anticipated the mass exodus. The point that she raised is even more relevant.</span></p>

LIABILITY OF PARENTS TO MAINTAIN CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF NINETEEN IN RESPECT OF WHOM INCOME SUPPORT IS PAID</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 3, line 5, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) In section 26(1)(a) of that Act, the words "himself or" shall cease to have effect.".</p></blockquote>
I am not certain where the matter comes in the hierarchy of importance defined by the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) for councils considering the colour of council house doors. In progressive authorities on which I have had the pleasure to sit, the tenants decided what colour they painted their doors. The matter that we are considering is rather arcane and occupies one of the shadowy recesses of legislation, yet is of some importance.<br><br>
It may be worth noting that so riveting was the discussion when the matter was discussed in Committee on 13 March 1986, that the Chairman was forced to suspend the proceedings because fewer than 10 members were present. It is a piece of anachronistic legislative litter that should be swept away and tidied off the statute book.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Amendment No. 4 would remove from section 26(1) of the Social Security Act 1986 the offence of persistently refusing or neglecting to maintain oneself. It is remarkable that such an offence exists.<br><br>
Section 26 provides that a person who
<br><blockquote><p>"persistently refuses or neglects to maintain himself or any person whom he is liable to maintain"</p></blockquote>
shall be guilty of an offence and liable to three months' imprisonment or a fine of up to £1,000.<br><br>
The amendment would not alter in any way a person's obligation to maintain his or her family, or the penalties for failing to do so. It would mean that if a person with no dependants failed to maintain himself or herself, it would no longer be an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment.<br><br>
The offence in its present form goes back at least to the Vagrancy Act 1824. Under section 3 of that Act, anyone who was
<br><blockquote><p>"able wholly or in part to maintain himself or herself, or his or her family, by work or by other means"</p></blockquote>
or who wilfully refused or neglected to do so, with the result that he, she or they became chargeable to the poor law authority, was deemed an idle and disorderly person.<br><br>
The Vagrancy Act 1824 stipulated that the penalty for failing to maintain oneself was to be committed to a house of correction, there to be kept to hard labour for any time not exceeding one calendar month. I am nervous about referring too much to what happened in the past. I remember a discussion on the factories legislation of 1832 in a previous Committee debate, and the legislation that brought
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0054">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 55</span>
in the emancipation of slaves, in order to draw parallels with views that are now respectable and voiced almost daily by Government Members, but I was brought to book by some of my hon. Friends for suggesting that we might put ideas into the heads of Ministers.<br><br>
Exley's "Guide to Poor Law Relief, which will clearly have greater currency in the future, advises that the offence of running away and leaving one's wife or children chargeable to the parish was considered more serious and involved the heavier penalty of three months' imprisonment. It is clear that the new punishment will be more severe than the 19-century poor law punishment.<br><br>
When this matter was discussed in March 1986, the then Minister confirmed that, although there had been between 100 and 200 prosecutions in liable relative cases in 1984 and 1985, there had not been a single prosecution for failing to maintain oneself since 1981. He said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that the power is needed because income support, like supplementary benefit, is the benefit of last resort. Other benefits, such as unemployment benefit, can be withdrawn when recipients refuse to work. While income support can be reduced, it cannot be refused if work is not immediately available, even if a claimant refuses a job shortly before receipt of benefit.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"I emphasise that it is a power of last resort and that, on balance, we believe that it is wise to keep it, notwithstanding the fact that it is used so irregularly."—<i>House of Commons, Standing Committee B,</i> 13 March 1986; c. 925.</p></blockquote>
What the Government intend to do in the Bill will remove the slight justification for keeping this arcane piece of legislation. It is not true even now that income support cannot be refused, unless work is immediately available. The availability tests, about which we are to hear a great deal, to which claimants are subjected can—and frequently do—result in a refusal of benefit without any evidence that a job of any kind is immediately available. If the Government argue that that is not true now, it will be even less true if the now notorious clause 7—this piece of concentrated malice that the Government have for us next week—goes through unamended. That clause specifically places the onus on a claimant to show that he or she is actively seeking employment, with no corresponding obligation on the adjudication officer to show that jobs are available.<br><br>
Once clause 7 is on the statute book, it is inconceivable that the power to prosecute a person for failing to maintain himself or herself will ever be used. If the Government intend to withdraw clause 7, we shall be delighted to withdraw this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should draw the Committee's attention to the fact that an amendment in precisely these terms was debated during the passage of the Social Security Act 1986. I shall come to the outcome of those debates in a moment.<br><br>
The amendment carries forward a long-held principle that has existed since the National Assistance Act 1948. Although it has been discussed, it has never been seriously challenged in all those 40 years, and more. Throughout that period it has been an offence for a person persistently to refuse or neglect to maintain himself or others whom he is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 56</span>
liable to maintain, if the result is that benefit has to be paid. The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) appeared to suggest that that condition would not be relevant in future. The amendment would remove the offence of failing to maintain oneself, while retaining it for failing to maintain a spouse and children.<br><br>
The power is needed because income support, like supplementary benefit and national assistance before it, is the benefit of last resort. Unemployment benefit can be withdrawn when recipients refuse to work. Income support may be reduced, but it cannot be refused if work is not immediately available.<br><br>
It has always been recognised, throughout the 40-plus years, that in order to avoid abuse, prosecution has to be available. The power is used very sparingly. No prosecutions have been brought under the Act since 1981. But it ought to be retained for blatant cases. No fewer than 78 prosecutions were brought under the last Labour Government—on 24 occasions in the course of one year. They were prepared to see it in existence then; they believed that it was a power of last resort that had to be maintained.<br><br>
It is a power of last resort. A claimant may quite blatantly say, "I do not have the slightest intention of taking any job that is offered to me. I know you have to continue to pay me, albeit at a reduced rate of income support, so I have no intention of getting a job. I shall not turn up for restart interviews, or accept any training. I shall not bother at all." He knows that a reduced rate of income support still has to be paid.<br><br>
In those circumstances, short of prosecution, the claimant advisers of the Department of Employment can draw—vigorously, if necessary—to the claimant's attention the last resort powers of prosecution.<br><br>
It is worth reminding the Committee of the outcome when this matter was considered during the passage of the 1986 Act. The hon. Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) spoke for the Opposition and after a brief debate he responded to my predecessor thus:
<br><blockquote><p>"I find his case more compelling … I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment."—<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> 13 March 1986; c.927.]</p></blockquote>
It seems that hon. Gentlemen were impressed by the Government's arguments on that occasion. Nothing has changed in the interim. I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) will come to the same conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Something may have changed. It did not occur to me during the 1986 deliberations, and I should welcome the Minister's confirmation of this, that the social fund provisions available to anyone on income support mean that a 16, 17 or 18-year-old may be given a social fund grant to prevent his being institutionalised. That may be made on a regular basis, and be a substantial sum of money. With the clause as it stands, the bill for that might land on the plate of the liable relative. If so, the Committee should consider that matter seriously. In general, I support the form of the clause, as I did in 1986.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0055">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 57</span>
In my previous incarnation, I was a practising solicitor doing family work in Scotland. In certain circumstances, liable relatives earning fancy sums of money consistently refused to, or delayed paying proper maintenance. The minds of such people would be concentrated by the existence of these provisions. Therefore, I support them. However, I am nervous of the impact that the social fund might have on the new situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The next amendment deals specifically with liable relatives, so the point should more correctly be addressed then. I should be surprised if young people of the age that the hon. Gentleman mentioned were available for community care grants on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is disappointing that, rather than respond fully to what has been said, the Minister has repeated what was said in the debates on the Social Security Act 1986. It is not true that income support cannot be withdrawn when no job is immediately available. If a person is not available, he does not get the reduced rate—he gets nothing. The legislation has lain unused for a long time. Although the arguments may well have persuaded my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, West (Mr. Meacher) when the Act was debated, he would not have been persuaded had he known about the present practice and the weight of future legislation.<br><br>
The Minister did no comment on the difference between the sledge-hammer of the severity of the threat now and what was available in a previous century. The threat now is of three calendar months, rather than one as it was then. We are not persuaded that the legislation deserves to remain on the statute book.<br><br>
Nor has the Minister responded to the question on clause 7. If the Government proceed with that clause, that would demolish any claim for the legislation to remain as a legitimate par of our law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can respond to that. Clause 7 is not relevant here. Even if someone has made himself unavailable for work, or is not actively seeking work, if he is able to claim severe hardship income support would still be available, albeit normally reduced by some 40 per cent. from the average level. To stop somebody who is blatantly opting out entirely from any commitment to find himself a job, that disincentive and deterrent ought to remain on the statute book. I accept that it would be rarely used, and I should be surprised if it got back to the level of use that was apparently acceptable under the last Labour Government. Nevertheless, as a deterrent, it ought to remain on the statute book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to return to this at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 11, in clause 4, page 3, line 35, at end insert—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 58</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"(5A) In section 33 of that Act, subsections (7)(c) and (8) shall cease to have effect.".</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to remove the Secretary of State's power to recover a social fund loan from a liable relative—the husband, wife or parent of a child for whose need the loan is made. The amendment seeks to differentiate between social fund payments and others and to put them in a special category.<br><br>
The power to recover income support payments from liable relatives is directly related to the obligation to maintain a wife, husband or children from whom that person is separated. That is reasonable and fair. If regular maintenance payments are not made by the liable relative, income support has to be paid. It has always been thought right—and I am sure that it will continue to be—that in such circumstances the DSS should have the power to recover the unpaid maintenance.<br><br>
Different considerations, however, apply to social fund payments. Income support payments are not recoverable, except from a liable relative, but social fund loans are recoverable from the recipient. There is no need to involve the liable relative, who knows what his or her liability is for regular or monthly maintenance payments. Social fund payments are, however, unpredictable. The liable relative may not even consider it reasonable that such a payment should have been awarded in the particular circumstances. He or she may also suspect that the loan would not have been awarded, had the social fund officer not assumed that it would be recovered from him rather than from the recipient.<br><br>
The effect of the clause on family relationships and on the possibility of a reconciliation could be disastrous. The possibility of awards of social fund loans being dependent on the ability of the liable relative to repay seems to be a recipe for a great deal of confusion and conflict, especially in families. In many cases—though not all—the reason why they are not sharing the same home is that the germs of conflict exist already; the clause will encourage them to flourish and will lead to all kinds of strains.<br><br>
Even from the Government's point of view, recovery of the loan from the liable relative does not make much sense. If the object of the loan system is to encourage people to budget for their needs—about which we have heard a great deal—lending money to a claimant and recovering it from someone else seems odd. It will hardly encourage people in the skills of budgeting or getting through their crisis.<br><br>
The power to recover income support payments is circumscribed by section 24 of the 1986 Act. The Secretary of State must apply for a court order and the court must have regard
<br><blockquote><p>"to all the circumstances and, in particular, to the income of the liable person, and may order him to pay such sum, weekly or otherwise, as it may consider appropriate"</p></blockquote>
but not exceeding the amount of income support paid.<br><br>
Section 33(7) gives power to recover social fund loans from liable relatives, but provides no such safeguards. The whole of the loan can be recovered, regardless of the circumstances of the liable relative.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0056">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 59</span>
Under section 24, the court can order payments to be made by the liable relative to the claimant instead of to the DSS. The procedure can thus operate to the claimant's advantage and may avoid the need for future income support. Recovery of social fund loans from liable relatives has no such advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) acknowledges that it has been the policy of successive Governments that social security payments should be recoverable from liable relatives. He has sought to persuade the Committee this morning that social fund loans should be in a different category. I shall explain why I believe that to be wrong.<br><br>
Let us be clear that the practical effect of the amendment will be that if a social fund payment is made, recovery will not be possible during a separation from a partner. If a loan has been made to a partner who has then left without the means to repay it, it will not be recoverable.<br><br>
If a couple split up after receiving a loan, we would continue to seek recovery of the loan from the partner to whom it had been made. If that were not possible, we should rightly be able to look to the other partner for recovery, unless the couple had clearlyy separated permanently, in which case recovery would cease. It is a limited power, but I believe it is right.<br><br>
As the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) said earlier, sometimes partners who have a liability are prompt, when they discover that a liability exists, in coming forward to settle the loan that was made to the partnership that existed when the loan was made. That is sensible.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the point of youngsters to whom community care grants may have been paid. I said that it was unlikely that they would regularly receive those grants. The vast majority of 16 and 17-year-olds, as a result of the provisions in the Social Security Act 1986, are in youth training schemes, employment or full-time education. They are not in circumstances where they would be likely to receive community care grants. They have to be in receipt of income support in order to get community care grants, and only in exceptional circumstances would they be eligible to receive them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I may be partly won over by the Minister's argument, if I have understood him correctly. Is he saying that when, after a marriage has broken up, a social fund loan is made, there is no possibility of provision for the social fund moneys to be recovered from the liable relative? I understood him to say that when the social fund grant or loan is made to the partnership before it splits up will any attempt be made by the Department to recover that money. If that is so, I am largely satisfied.<br><br>
What is the legal chapter and verse for that? As I read the clause, the marriage subsists, no matter how temporary, permanent or intermittent the separation may be. From my experience, couples very often go through a traumatic period of coming and going, sometimes in good faith, trying to recover the marriage. It is difficult for the Department to know in many cases whether it is making the award to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 60</span>
partners who are living together or separated. If social fund money that passes to a responsible parent who has custody of a child after the marriage has broken up cannot be recovered from the liable relative, I shall be reasonably satisfied. I do not think that the clause states that, but if the Minister says that it does, who am I to contradict him?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We would have the power to recover from liable relatives, but if the marriage had permenantly broken up and a loan had been made to the individual who had been abandoned and who was unable to pay, we would cease to recover that loan. If the separation was temporary and the person to whom the loan had been made was unable to pay, we would pursue payment from the relative or the partner who had left.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What part of the clause differentiates between a couple who are together and a couple who are separated? I do not see that in the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am telling the Committee that that would be the practice that we would follow in these circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is quite different. I do not suggest that the Minister is seeking to mislead the Committee, but he left me with the clear impression in his reply to amendment No. 4 that there would be no power. He is saying that there is a power but that Parliament will not use it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for winkling out the admission that this legislation could monumentally disrupt families who are already in crisis. If a family, or even a single member of that family, has received a social fund payment, it is virtually certain that they are on the rocks and in severe financial trouble. For a couple, the effect of a break up means that that problem is not halved but multiplied by two; as the family home is broken up, there is a need for two dwelling places. It is a serious problem.<br><br>
A young person may have a community care grant, a couple who break up may come back together, and children who leave home may return home. The effect of rules being introduced to recover money will have an inflammatory effect on a delicate human situation which can be rebuilt.<br><br>
I believe that this clause is unnecessary. It is not worth the trouble for the minute amount of money that might be recovered. Any humane Government with a sensitive regard for their duty to protect and nurture human relationships would not proceed with it.</span></p>

MOBILITY ALLOWANCE: INCREASE OF AGE LIMIT TO 80 YEARS.</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 24, in page 3, line 41, after "5", insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1AA) In section 37A(1) of the principal Act, for the words 'such that he is either unable to walk or virtually unable to do so', there shall be substituted the words 'or mental handicap such that—
<ol>
<li>he is unable or virtually unable to walk; or</li>
<li>he is normally unable to make uninterrupted progress on foot without continual physical support or physical control from another person; or</li>
<li>the exertion required for walking without such support or control would be likely to constitute a danger to his life or lead to a serious deterioration in his health'.</li></ol>
<ul><li>() In subsection (2) of that section, after the word 'disablement' there shall be inserted the words 'or mental handicap'.".</li></ul></p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the existing regulations for entitlement to mobility allowance. Its purpose is to extend mobility allowance to those with a mental handicap or to those who may be both deaf and blind.<br><br>
In my experience as a Member of Parliament, the people who are caused the most distress and heartbreak are those who go through the process of applying for a mobility allowance, who genuinely believe that they are entitled to it—and prima facie appear to be—but who then find that they are not.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 62</span>
They have a deep sense of grievance and injustice because of the way in which mobility allowance grants are made.<br><br>
I have had cases of people with a profound mental handicap, which means that they lack the necessary co-ordination for what we would describe as ordinary walking. They need consistent and continual physical assistance while they are walking. They may have applied for a mobility allowance and they may even have got as far as appealing to the medical appeals tribunal, but they have been turned down because the tribunal felt that their behavioural problems were attributable to physical disablement and were not severe enough to justify a mobility allowance. I appreciate that it may be difficult to reach a decision in these cases. However, that is regarded by the applicants as a harsh application of the letter of the law.<br><br>
The primary legislation dealing with mobility allowance is section 37 of the Social Security Act 1975. The secondary legislation is in the mobility allowance regulations 1975. Our amendment seeks to clarify and sharpen up that legislation. I assume that the Minister will say that he supports the amendment, at least in principle. I have served on three Standing Committees since I have been a Member of Parliament. I hope that the Minister will say that he supports what we say in principle and that he is able to give practical support to the amendment.<br><br>
Section 37A of the principal Act states that mobility difficulties must be the result of physical disablement. That is a barrier to some people—perhaps not a large number—who ought to be entitled to the allowance. That phrase causes great problems to people with mental handicaps. In the past, lengthy legal wrangling was needed to establish physical disablement.<br><br>
I will give the example of Down's syndrome, which can count as physical disablement because of its genetic origin. While case law has clarified the situation for some people with mental handicaps, there are many others, particularly those whose mental handicap is not the result of a recognised and named syndrome, who have real problems over establishing physical disablement. Part of the amendment, therefore, proposes a relatively minor change—to insert the words "mental handicap", thus building into the primary legislation a principle that case law has already established. Let us clear the books, accept case law and use this opportunity to include those words in the primary legislation.<br><br>
It is not the case, as the amendment might imply, that all people with mental handicaps would qualify for a mobility allowance. They would still have to meet the requirements of the existing criteria that would remain in the legislation as it stands. The amendment would mean that seriously mentally handicapped people and people who are both deaf and blind—whose problems are such that they need someone actively to help them to move about—are included.<br><br>
We should not be opening the floodgates. A relatively small number of people with severe mobility problems are currently unable to receive the mobility allowance. Although they are physically able
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0058">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 63</span>
to walk, they are unable to make use of their walking ability without continuous physical support or control from another person. The two groups that I emphasise are people with mental handicaps and people who are both deaf and blind. At present they cannot receive mobility allowances, for two reasons. One is the restrictive wording of the current legislation; the other is the series of inconsistent legal rulings that stretch back over case law for over 10 years.<br><br>
The existing regulations state that mobility allowance can be claimed by people who are unable to walk, or who are virtually unable to walk, or where the exertion of walking could endanger their life or lead to a serious deterioration in their health. Looking back over case studies and case history in mobility allowance, the second of those categories is the main cause of contention and argument. What does it mean to be virtually unable to walk?<br><br>
For people with mobility problems, attempts have repeatedly been made since the introduction of mobility allowance to argue that they should be considered "virtually unable to walk". Those attempts have met with only limited success. We are left with a bewildering jungle of case law, with people confused about whether they can apply, or whether they are entitled to apply.<br><br>
I will give examples. Since 1978, social security commissioners have considered the question of the need for assistance where there is a virtual inability to walk. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of consistency in their decisions. As a result, claimants have felt confused. They feel a sense of injustice when their claims fail, which seem to depend solely upon decisions of the commission. If commission decisions were favourable at the time they put in their application, their cases might have been more favourably assessed than if they had submitted them when commission decisions were unfavourable.<br><br>
In 1983, a tribunal of commissioners decided that, if a person could walk to a designated place only with the benefit of guidance or supervision, the point might be reached at which he could be considered to be virtually unable to walk. Following that decision, some people with the need of support made successful claims. Shortly afterwards, another commissioner argued that "walking" in relation to the mobility allowance regulations was restricted to the physical ability to move the legs and that other problems not related to this inability were irrelevant. That decision was upheld in the House of Lords in April 1985.<br><br>
I had the most pathetic, in the best sense of the word case, when a man who had had one leg amputated came to me. Because the phrase is "ability to move the legs"—in the plural—it was suggested that his case would not be upheld. It was argued that the man had an artificial limb and was therefore able to move. I have taken up that case, but it was lost at the tribunal. I quote that case—not as a special plea for that man but simply to demonstrate to the Minister that the whole matter of case law is difficult and misleading. We have an opportunity now to sort out the mess. That would be better than hon. Members quoting individual cases to try to build the law on cases rather instead of incorporating this provision in the primary legislation.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 64</span>
The complexity of case law has now reached the point where it is impossible for the ordinary claimant, or the person who is looking after the claimant, to know whether they meet the requirements of the mobility allowance regulations. These are seen as the most difficult area of benefit. There is a maze of regulations through which claimants must find their way. Often they cannot do so without legal advice and representation, to which they may not have ready access. They take the view that the law is set against them and that they ought not to claim.<br><br>
I appeal to the Minister to say that there should not be long years of legal wrangling. If there is a commitment—and I am convinced that the Government have expressed a commitment—that these people should receive the mobility allowance, now is the opportunity to make a change in legislation to bring that about.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will not respond by telling me how much the measure will cost and how many people will be involved. The mobility allowance campaign, a group comprising many disability organisations, has done work on the numbers. It estimates that the maximum number who would benefit from this proposed amendment is no more than 10,000. It also says that it would cost no more than £12 million a year. If we are looking for value for money. The allowance would go to those who need it most.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to use this opportunity to cut through the case law and sharpen up the law. He should amend the primary legislation and ensure that the people who are entitled to mobility allowance in the circumstances I have described receive it. We have an opportunity to sort out the mess now and in that way to send a signal that we know where we stand in relation to mobility allowance, and who ought to be entitled to it. People will then know that they can claim mobility allowance, and doctors and those who deal with tribunals will more easily be able to judge cases.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Thurnham <span class='memberconstituency'>(Bolton, North-East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the speech of the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). I agree with many of the points that he made. He was perhaps a little naive to think that the Minister would not reply with numbers and costs. I suspect that that will be the stumbling block to any progress at the moment.<br><br>
I expect that my hon. Friend will also refer to the surveys of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and will wait for the results. It reminds me of my time many years ago at Harvard business school. A professor said that he would give nil marks to any student who said that he would wait for the results of a market survey, and full marks to those who said that they assumed that the results of the market survey would prove their assumptions, and that if their assumptions were proven they would do certain things. What would my hon. Friend like to do? He might find that the Bill gives him the opportunity to do it now because the numbers and costs are relatively small.<br><br>

12 noon<br><br>
The Government's record on payments for the disabled is very good. The expenditure on the mobility allowance since 1979 has risen from £79 million to £650 million this year. The number of recipients has increased from 200,000 in 1979 to over 500,000 in 1988. The Government cannot be accused of being stingy or not directing a good benefit at a large target group, but can it be extended to the mentally handicapped?<br><br>
My own experience relates to a constituent called Daniel Heaton who was a lively little boy who appears to have nothing wrong with him, but he is severely mentally handicapped because he is autistic. He can run around a room with no trouble. His difficulty is that he may not stop running or he may decide to sit down and not move at all. He received the allowance for some time but for some strange reason it was taken away. I helped with the appeal for him to have the allowance restored and I attended the tribunal hearing. When the commissioners saw the mother with the child and the difficulties that could arise, they had no difficulty in granting the award. I was pleased that the mother was helped. That case demonstrates the difficulty of following closely the wording and terms of the mobility allowance; that boy has no difficulty in putting one foot in front of the other, if he chooses to do so. Will the Minister extend the provision slightly?<br><br>
I do not wish to be unfair, but we may be weighing in the balance of the Government's comfort against the deprivations and sufferings of some extremely disabled people and their carers. It may suit the Government's comfort to wait for the OPCS survey, but I beg my hon. Friend to make some assumptions about the results of the survey. He should accept the figures of 10,000 people and a cost of £12 million. Let us extend a benefit which is costing over £500 million and give comfort to a relatively small number of people for whom this is a major problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I seek only to help the argument of the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) which he has put extremely well. No doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that the Minister already has the results of the survey. We do not have them because they have not yet been published. Therefore the hon. Gentleman's point has even more force.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister has them, but even if he has he must have time to consider them. Sufficient information is available from the work done by the Spastics Society and Mencap—the two groups who have made representations to me—as well as from other bodies for us to make certain assumptions. In view of the total size of the benefit of £500 million, we should find room for this provision. It would help those people who face major problems because they do not qualify for this allowance.<br><br>
We are pleased to debate this allowance and the provision to extend the limit from age 75 to 80. We shall consider the allowance further on other
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 66</span>
amendments. As to the particular provision of mental handicap, the numbers are sufficiently small and the cost sufficiently well identified for the Government to make a decision. Although I do not want to press the matter now, it will be looked at again when the Bill goes to the other place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) for his comments, and I am not unsympathetic towards some of his points. We need to discuss the timing of any change to this and other benefits.<br><br>
I am also grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) for drawing the Committee's attention to the growth in expenditure and the successful claims for this allowance. That is reflected in the attendance allowance. No one would call into question the Government's commitment to proper provision in this area.<br><br>
I can tell the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) that I have seen no results of OPCS surveys that have not yet been published. I, too, am waiting with bated breath for the other four reports, in addition to the two that have been published.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Department in possession of that information?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Four reviews were carried out and their findings will be published in six reports. The Office of Population Censuses and Surveys is drawing up those reports one by one. They will then go to the Department one by one. I do not know whether the Department has a draft of the third report. I have not seen it, but at most the Department will have seen only three reports. In due course, we shall receive the six reports and at that time there will be public discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the timetable? I do not know whether Samuel Beckett is related to the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) but sometimes I feel that we are "Waiting for Godot".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given the timetable in the House. The last of the six repors will be published by July of this year. That is not an unduly extended timetable and Godot will arrive in due course.<br><br>
I do not think that the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) has been in touch with me or the Department about his constituency case. If he had, I should have noted it carefully. I should be grateful if he would write to me with the circumstances of the case so that I can identify it and consider it carefully.<br><br>
I do not complain about the use of the clause to extend the limits of mobility allowance. Nevertheless, it would be right to await the results of the OPCS survey and consider the matter comprehensively against the background of other changes to benefits that we might make at that stage.<br><br>
To respond to the points about case law and how it has developed, I have tried to reach a considered judgment of the outcome of case law in recent years. The current system enables mentally handicapped
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0060">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 67</span>
people to qualify for mobility allowance of a physical factor restricts their walking ability. At the beginning of the 1980s, there was a period of uncertainty when varying judgments were made. Since then, the decisions of social security commissioners and the courts have resulted in a framework for consistent decisions.<br><br>
The provision in paragraph (b) of the amendment has never been at issue. It has always been acepted that disabled people who need physical support from another person in order to make progress on foot should qualify for the allowance. We have amended the guidance which we give to the examining doctors to draw their attention to the need to take account also of balance problems and we have suggested that they ought to carry out tests to establish that. The sensory deprivation of either sight or hearing and mental handicap can affect balance. We are anxious that that should also be carefully taken into account. I believe that evidence is now emerging that examing doctors do so when they assess walking ability.<br><br>
I am sympathetic to the case that the hon. Gentleman has advanced. However, it may be more complex that that. I would want to look at any extension of the criteria for mobility allowance against the background of the OPCS surveys and the changes that we may be considering in other allowances, too. I can see the force of the hon. Gentleman's argument. No doubt he will stand up in a moment and urge me to do this as an interim measure so that we can return to the broader seam at a later date. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East would probably prefer that. But there are not many months to go until July. We shall then have an unprecedented wealth of information about the numbers and circumstances of disabled people and how the benefit system and services that are provided to respond to their needs.<br><br>
The present survey covers children with sensory handicaps and people with a mental handicap which the previous survey in 1969 did not cover. That is an important part of the supporting argument that the hon. Gentleman was putting forward here. I ask the Committee to note my sympathy with a number of points that the hon. Gentleman has made. However, we should wait a little longer and make up our minds on these issues against a broader framework. In those circumstances, I hope that he will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support entirely the thrust of the amendment. I listened carefully to what the Minister said. He seemed to suggest that this already happens in any case: that case law has moved in this direction and that decisions have stacked up and made the terms of the amendment unnecessary. If that is so, it would cost the Government nothing at all. The hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) said that the probable excuse fo resisting the amendment would be cost. The Minister shakes his head and thus agrees that cost is not a factor, because the amendment has already been met in practice. If that is so, there is no case for resisting such a change in the primary legislation.<br><br>
Of course it is right to say that the OPCS study must be carefully considered and its arguments weighed. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 68</span>
I thought that positive progress would be made in that direction in next year's social security Bill, I might be a little more inclined to support the Minister. But I think that the Department will find itself bogged down in a substantial amount of work resulting from the OPCS review that will be fully available in July. There should be a period of time for public discussion of that document so that we can obtain the views of the pressure groups. Some of them are very expert. It would be a year, or perhaps even two, before we gathered the fruits of the legislation.<br><br>
The Minister cannot hide behind the defence that the review will take only until July. It will probably take until July 1991 or 1992. that is a long time to wait. Before the Committee this morning is a tangible improvement to a process that the Government have already admitted will cost nothing. They have no other objections to it. I am addressing the Trappist monks behind the Minister of State <i>[Interruption.]</i>— and monkesses, I stand corrected—because they will have to go back to their constituencies and defend their position. I understand the restraints under which Government Back Benchers have to operate, but they should consider the issue very carefully. The Minister has said that it will cost no more money. I believe that there is unanimous agreement on the Committee that it is a sensible move, so why the dickens do we not grasp the nettle and make it now?</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not impressed, as perhaps some of my hon. Friends are, by the hon. Gentleman's solicitude about their position in their constituencies. My hon. Friends will have no difficulty about saying that the right way forward, in this as in other sensitive areas disability—we all know that there are many more—is to wait for all the information and then make a coherent judgment about future patterns.<br><br>
I cannot give undertakings, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) knows, about any future legislative programme. However, once we have that information, I am anxious to consider it and reach a conclusion as quickly as possible. Of course, there will have to be a period of public discussion about the matter. It would offend many people outside were we not to allow that. We can also note that, even as individual reports are coming out, we are getting reactions. So we shall not be starting from scratch when the final report is published in July.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should look at specific cases, because we all know, from our constituency work, of cases similar to those that have been discussed this morning. It is frustrating and wasteful to have detailed, tortuous arguments about the cause of people's afflictions, whether physical or mental. I am sure that that is not the Government's intention. But it is a rare experience for my hon. Friends and me to acknowledge the sincerity of the contributions from Conservative Members. I am sure that there is no difference between us in our determination that something should be done.<br><br>
Two cases have been brought to our attention that would be covered by the amendment. We should
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0061">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 69</span>
have to be made of stone not to be moved by the details. One case is that of a woman of 23 who was diagnosed as having a mental handicap, probably due to brain damage at birth. She has a mental age of between five and six, poor balance and little speech. Her mobility problems require continual physical assistance while walking, in the form of support and pulling or pushing. She trips and stumbles, due to her poor balance, and because she does not lift her feet high enough she is unable to co-ordinate her mental processes with her foot movements. She has frequent behavioural problems while walking: she freezes and stares into space, and habitually sits down anywhere—it could be on the road, where she would be in grave danger. She is heavy and immovable, as in many similar cases. If anyone tries to force her to move, she struggles, kicks and bursts into tears. Yet her mobility allowance claim was disallowed by the medical appeals tribunal. It agreed that she had a physical disability, but it considered that she had made conscious decisions to stop that behaviour. However, there is no evidence that she is capable of making conscious decisions about anything, including what to eat.<br><br>
The other case is that of a man aged 28 who has a profound mental handicap, no speech, abnormal and unco-ordinated vision and grand mal epilepsy. He has mobility problems and needs constant physical assistance while walking, due to his lack of co-ordination, poor balance, and so on. Even with continual physical assistance he has frequent tantrums, when he screams, stamps and lashes out. He applied for a mobility allowance, but he was turned down on appeal to a medical tribunal.<br><br>
The amount involved—£12 million was suggested, and the figure has not been denied—is minute. It is perhaps 2 per cent, of the total that is being paid in allowances, anyway, so it is not a great move forward. Of course we want to consider the OPCS reviews when they come out. But there will be a protracted period of examination before any legislation is produced. That certainly will not be 1989. It will probably not be until 1991. Again, there is a threat of a nil cost review from which we have suffered elsewhere. In our normal generous way, we can give the Government credit. In the range of appreciation from silence to three rousing cheers we can give them at least half a cheer. If they accept today's amendment we can elevate that to half a rousing cheer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the fact that the Minister said that he was sympathetic to the case. That is in keeping with the Government's approach here. However I am still baffled as to why, if he accepts that these groups need to be included, he backed off from accepting the amendments as a practical way of doing that. He suggested that it was a question of timing and review. Either he is sympathetic and supports the case and sees this as an opportunity or we must look to the distant future and reviews.<br><br>
The Minister leaves me in great confusion about the reports from the OPCS. As I understand, it we are not waiting for all of them there have already been two reports, both dealing with disability. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 70</span>
first report, "The Prevalence of Disability Among Adults", tabulates the results of a survey of the number of disabled people in Britain. The second is entitled, "The Financial Circumstances of Disabled Adults Living in Private Households". I assume that other reviews deal with other topics. Perhaps the third one will deal with family credit and child benefit. I do not know what else to expect, but I rather assume that the four remaining reviews will not deal with disability.<br><br>
On 29 November, the Social Service Advisory Committee published in findings on the benefit system for people with disabilities. It found that system to be inadequate and complex. It concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"The publication of the OPCS survey of disabled people provides an opportunity to review the needs of disabled people in detail and to construct a model for reform with great precision. This opportunity may not be repeated for many years and must be grasped."</p></blockquote>
That puts a time bracket on it. I am glad that the Minister did not say that next July means that we are out of the fiscal year and that the budget decisions have already been made for this year. I understand that the reviews will be at nil cost. The Minister has accepted that the financial burden of the measure is not too great to be incorporated within the budget of the Department. No special meeting of the Cabinet is needed to discuss with the Treasury whether it can be included in the Department's budget. That is not an issue. We are now down to the issue of timing and intent and whether the Minister can accept the wording of the amendment.<br><br>
If the Minister cannot accept our amendment, can he come up with an alternative set of words that would incorporate the principle of the amendment in to the Bill? He said that there is now a framework of court decisions and there have been amendments to the guidance. That is all just background notes. Now is the time to alter the primary legislation so that everything is clear. Why not seize the opportunity now? There are no practical objections to doing that in principle. Perhaps the problem is our wording. Would the Minister be prepared to table an alternative amendment? Secondly, will he illuminate me further about the topics of the remaining reviews to be published?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All the reports are on disability. That was the purpose of the survey. They cover the circumstances of individuals—divided into adults and children—living independently and in communal care and the delivery of services to disabled people, which is an important part of the pattern of support that society gives to them. We made clear at the beginning that we wish to see all the reports before coming to a conclusion about the way forward. We are supported in that by the Chairman of the Social Security Advisory Committee, not always the strongest supporter of the Government, who concluded that it was right to wait for all the reports.<br><br>
I am interested in the suggestion that the Bill may receive Royal Assent before the end of the financial year. No doubt, progress in Committee will be such that that will happen. However, even if that were true, I should still be inclined not to accept the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0062">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 71</span>
amendment, for the reasons that I have outlined. Case law is dealing already—to a considerable extent—with the aim of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Clare Short <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case, accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady should be patient—a "but" is coming.<br><br>
Even the amendment suggests that mental handicap should have an impact on entitlement to mobility allowance. Many mentally handicapped people are qualified for the allowance. About one in three qualify in the initial stage, which is below the general average for mobility allowance applications. About the same proportion then qualify at the medical board stage, which is about average, and about three in four qualify at the medical appeal tribunal stage. Of course, if we accept the amendment, each of those stages may take a message from the primary legislation. Whatever conclusion the Government reach, we shall still need examining doctors, medical boards and appeal tribunals. Decisions at earlier stages will sometimes be overruled, and in other cases confirmed, by the later stages of the appeal tribunal. Even passing an amendment as apparently clear as this one, does not remove all uncertainty from the judgments that those responsible must make.<br><br>
I repeat my plea to the Committee. We have listened sympathetically to the arguments. Case law has already started to change because of decisions of commissioners and courts. I ask the Committee to support me in waiting for the overall findings of the OPCS survey so that the Government can consider it against the background of wider costs, priorities, the impact of one set of benefits and another and the role that services can play in the overall provision for disabled people. It is right to bear all those factors in mind and give them coherent, overall consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Battle</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am mindful of that fact that, on an earlier clause, the Minister said that he was interested in ensuring that the base benefits were individually sensitive. It is important to remind the Minister that, as the OPCS report emphasised, over 70 per cent. of disabled adults are on incomes of three-quarters of the average income or less. Thirty five per cent, are on incomes of less than half of the average income, after estimated extra spending relating to disability was taken into account.<br><br>
The incomes of people with disabilities are substantially below the incomes of the rest of the population. I am anxious that those people should not wait. It is not a bonus or an optional extra for them to receive mobility allowance. They need the money. Although I am encouraged that the Minister says that he is sympathetic to the case, I am discouraged when he says that we must wait for a lengthy review and that we can simply build on case law. We shall miss an opportunity to build the principle into primary legislation.<br><br>

Because I am dissatisfied with the Minister's reply on timing, I shall withdraw the amendment with a view to returning to the matter on Report. I shall then press the Government harder about timing because that became the issue for the Committee this morning. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 17, in page 3, line 42, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"paragraphs (a) and (aa) of.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 18, in page 3, line 43, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Subsection (5)(aa) of that section shall cease to have effect.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 5, in page 4, line 4, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(3) Any increase in the rate of mobility allowance specified in paragraph 3A of Part III of Schedule 4 to the principal Act after the coming into force of this section shall apply equally to persons of all ages who are entitled to a mobility allowance.".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of abbreviation, I normally say in Committee that the amendment is self-explanatory. However, I must admit that although I moved the amendment it certainly is not self-explanatory.<br><br>
I am sure that everyone will welcome the effect of the two amendments that extend entitlement to mobility allowance to people who have become disabled after the age of 65.I hope that most people would agree with such a move, and I expect to be successful this morning. Obviously, we welcome the extension of the upper age limit from 75 to 80: that is a step in the right direction and nobody would dispute that disabled people thoroughly deserve that extension of the mobility allowance, but that should not stop help going to people who become disabled after the age of 65.<br><br>
Just because someone is 65 and disabled does not mean that it costs him any less to get about or that he is so old that it does not matter if he cannot get about. The Government obviously do not believe that that is the case—that is why they have extended the age limit for those who are already claiming. Therefore, some help should be given to those who suddenly become disabled after the age of 65.<br><br>
A study has been carried out by the Welsh Consumer Council, which found that only 47 per cent. of elderly patients felt that they were able to reach hospital on public transport. Therefore, a mobility allowance to use private transport is essential. Also, the OPCS survey confirmed that disabled pensioners who may already be on low incomes incur increased expenditure as a consequence of disability, although only 3 per cent. recieve the mobility allowance.<br><br>
There is a strong argument for allowing people to have mobility allowance at the later stage of affliction. We are supposed to be a civilised society, and we should not have an age discrimination, especially as it is not logical. It reminds me of the stories of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0063">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 73</span>
old days and a more uncivilised world where people were tribal and would move about to better hunting grounds or better land for farming. That would happen seasonally and the sign that someone was getting old, was about to die and was no longer any use was that he did not take down his tent and so on but sat there and the tribes moved on. It was an unwritten law or understanding that that person was no longer able to survive in that system, so just faded away and died.<br><br>
That was obviously an awful system and we are supposed to be civilised, but in a sense we are saying that if someone becomes disabled after the age of 65, he has reached old age, so it is not our responsibility or concern. That is awful and unfair, and I cannot see any justification for it. There is no logical reason why the allowance should not be paid to all disabled people later on in life. The present system of cutting off the allowance when a person reaches 65 is incredible. People live longer nowadays and they are likely to find that they cannot move around so well in old age. They should be considered for mobility allowance.<br><br>
We do not accept that mobility requirements decrease when a person reaches 65; the opposite is the case. Pensions may be small and the aging process causes problems. It is nonsense to say that someone who is 65 does not need extra mobility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not the overwhelming shift towards atomisation—smaller housing units and more loneliness and isolation? The problem for the old is being stuck in a house on their own without children, grandchildren, nephews and nieces. That isolation makes the need for mobility greater than it has ever been. People do not come to the elderly; they have to go out to other people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michie</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's comments. People now live longer—and some of my constituents have outlived their sons and daughters. Nowadays people tend to stay in the community because it is good for them. Consequently, there are not so many full-time services and hostels. People live in tiny flats but they are not allowed to claim the mobility allowance if they are afflicted after the age of 65.<br><br>
We must be fair all round. Previous Governments have said that we cannot afford it, but if it is right, we should find ways of doing it. The government tell us that we are living in a boom period. North sea oil has given us opportunities, but we have squandered billions of pounds and many people are no better off. Because so much money has been floating about, the top 5 per cent. of the population have had massive tax handouts. In a civilised soicety those at the top who are fit and well could afford to go without those handouts; those over 65 who are suddenly disabled should receive that money. It is no good saying that it is not practical or that we cannot afford it. In the present financial climate the means are there but the Government do not have the will to act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We often go in the wrong direction when dealing with the mobility allowance. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 74</span>
allowance was introduced when invalid carriages were done away with, so it is logical to argue that someone who had an invalid carriage to get about should have a mobility allowance. That would also be suitable for those who cannot drive. We say that a person who cannot walk unaided before he reaches 65 is entitled to a mobility allowance, but we forget that some people—for example, those in old people's homes—have no intention of going out and about. A person who becomes disabled at the age of 65 and a day does not receive the allowance, but a person who becomes disabled before he is 65 gets an additional allowance.<br><br>
I cannot support the amendment, but the Government need to go back to first principles. They should direct the money to those who live in the community who need to go shopping or to work, regardless of their age or when they became disabled.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall speak briefly, because I have said already what I wanted to say on mobility allowance. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) has just mentioned, this measure started out in life as the invalid vehicle scheme. It is now called the mobility allowance. Considering how the upper age limit has moved, perhaps we should call it the crawling allowance. Monetary people used to talk about a crawling peg for exchange rate mechanisms. It must be 10 years since the age limit was raised from 65 to 75. We are faced with the need to take action now, so we have decided to raise the limit from 75 to 80. We must be near to making the allowance valid for life.<br><br>
Again I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to make some small assumptions about what will emerge from the rest of the OPCS surveys. We already have two, which are relevant to this issue. We should say that the allowance is for life, instead of regarding it as yet another interim stage, which will obviously require further legislation in five years, at the most. Why not take the step now of making the allowance for life?<br><br>
I cannot believe that the cost will amount to much. Five hundred people over 75 are affected, and there could only be a handful of people over 80 who would be affected. There are difficulties in trying to raise the age limit above 65 for applications because disability and the aging process go together. It is difficult to remove the allowance from people who already have it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman really listening to what he is saying? Someone who ceases to be mobile after the age of 65 still has the needs of a human being to go to church, or to go shopping, or to visit relatives and so on. How can the hon. Gentleman say so crudely that it is OK to cut off people if they are unlucky enough to have become disabled after the age of 65? That is grossly unjust.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thurnham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not deny that that is a problem and I dare say that it involves a measure of injustice, but we are talking about priorities; some matters are more unjust than others. In a perfect world, everybody would be perfectly mobile until they dropped dead, or they would be given an allowance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0064">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 75</span>
to compensate for not being mobile. We are a long way from that.<br><br>
There would be great problems of cost and numbers of people if the age for applications were extended beyond its current limit. It is difficult to take away an allowance from someone who has it. In view of the small numbers involved, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider—if not today, then at a later stage of the Bill's progress—making the allowance for life. We could then say that the Government have done everything possible regarding the mobility allowance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw to the Committee's attention the proposals in amendment No. 5. That has been selected with amendment No. 17, which was moved so ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie). Amendment No. 5 raises a different point, but it is of equal interest.<br><br>
The clause proposes to extend the mobility allowance to those over 75. Amendment No. 5 raises the question of the Government's more long-term intentions. It is in the classic mould of a probing amendment. When the issue of the age extension that the Bill proposes, and which we welcome, was last brought up, there were strong rumours that the Government were considering recovering the costs of raising the age limit by freezing the value of the allowance either for all recipients or for those over a certain age. Because of the eventual publication of the different OPCS reports, that discussion appears to have faded into the background. Now the Government say in response to everything, "Wait until after the OPCS reports." We feel that this is an ideal opportunity for the Minister to say what he does not have in mind, if he will not say what he does have in mind. We should like an assurance to be put on record that the Government have no such intention.<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
Our anxiety is not ill-founded. In his able contribution to the debate on the previous amendment, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) drew attention to the fact that the Government suggested that after the OPCS had been published and consultation had taken place, the review of disability benefits would be at nil cost. Those words strike a chill into our hearts as a matter of form, because a nil cost review always has serious implications. They might even strike a chill into the hearts of Conservative Members who have considered disability benefits, because they are the precise words used of the great Fowler review, which was portrayed as being a nil cost review of the social security system. It resulted in substantial savings of hundreds, if not thousands, of millions of pounds.<br><br>
There is a consistent pattern or thread running through the Government's social security policy. Any improvement in one type of benefit has to be paid for by a cut in benefits elsewhere. The Government's redistribution of wealth is always carried out within the framework of those who receive social security benefits. It always results in a substantial recovery of income by the Treasury and a net saving of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 76</span>
expenditure that would otherwise have been incurred by the social security system.<br><br>
I suggest that the Minister should examine the Government's record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In a moment. Every Bill introduced by the Government has resulted in a net saving to the social security system. Of course, there has been a general expansion of expenditure because of the increasing number of people reaching retirement and becoming entitled to disability benefits—not to mention those who draw unemployment benefit. Every Bill dealing with social security has cut benefit provision and resulted in a net saving. It is no good the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce), to whom I am about to give way, shaking his head. I am stating the facts. He can check any record and he will find that all that I have said is accurate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Gentleman to intervene briefly, I hope that his comments will relate to the amendment, not to the Bill as a whole or to issues that might be raised during the clause stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bruce</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your point, Mr. Winterton. I shall refer to the remarks made by the hon. Lady. If they were in order then my comments on them must also be in order.<br><br>
I question her interpretation. If one examines how an individual is treated under the present social security system compared with the previous regime, one realises that there have been constant improvements. There have been recent reductions in social security spending because the Government have reduced unemployment, which I am sure the hon. Lady welcomes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Briefly, please.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be pleased to reply briefly. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman has been unlucky and has not been in the Committee. If he believes that no one is receiving less benefit now than under the previous system, I suggest that he makes his way hot foot to the Library and consults the reports of the Committee stages of the Social Security Bills between 1984 and 1988.1 mention only those Committees on which I sat. He will find copious examples of people who are receiving less money today than they would have received, had that legislation not been passed.<br><br>
I am touched by the hon. Gentleman's belief in Minister's stories. It is touching to see a Member of Parliament in this cynical world who has so much faith in the Government. I assure him that he has been misinformed. Wider study might enlighten him.<br><br>
I return to the amendment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall seek to remain in order and keep my remarks brief.<br><br>
We are worried not by a mere rumour that the Government will freeze the value of the allowance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0065">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 77</span>
for people over retirement age or for claimants in general; the Government have actually done so several times. I shall give three examples. I suggest that the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) should listen, if he wishes to extend his education.<br><br>
First, the Government reduced the rates of income support in April last year. The technical annex to last year's Social Security Bill, which was presented to the House in 1985, gave illustrative rates of income support that people might receive. In most cases, they differed slightly from the rates under the old system, but for unemployed couples or individuals they were almost the same. There was a 4p or 5p difference. When final figures were printed in 1988, it became apparent that the Government had clawed back the full amount of even that payment. Thus, the new basic payment was less than was paid in 1985, but the Government had disquised that drop by adding an average compensation payment of £1.30 for rates. The hon. Member for Dorset, South may know that the Government recently confirmed that the average rates cost £1.50.<br><br>
Nevertheless, the Government used that device to disguise an underlying cut in the basic rate of income support. Ministers have since admitted that they did that. I concede that they have not explicitly said so, but when my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) put the case to the Minister in the House, he reluctantly and glumly nodded. The fact that he nodded was put on the record and that contention has never been challenged. Indeed, the figures support it conclusively. That is one example of the Government using a clever, simple device to reduce the amount of money that would otherwise have been paid.<br><br>
The second example occurred about two years ago, when the Government decided to offset the additional earnings-related pension against the invalidity allowance that is also paid to some disabled people. Since those benefits were introduced, there has been a consistent threat—not denied by any previous Conservative Government—that the addtional earnings-related pension would be paid on account of contributions made. Like the earnings-related retirement pension, the amount paid is reflected in an increase in the invalidity pension. By contrast, the invalidity allowance was paid on a completely different basis, to relect lost earnings capacity. Under previous Governments the two allowances had been paid side by side. By definition, the invalidity allowance was payable at a higher rate if one- had been disabled at an early age, because the amount of lost earnings was greater.<br><br>
A couple of years ago, the Government chose to offset one allowance against the other, and claimed for the first time that, after all, they were paid for the same disability. That resulted in substantial losses to disabled individuals. People found it extremely difficult to follow the arguments and only knew that they had lost benefit. Their first reaction was that it must be a mistake, but they then had to accept glumly what the Government had done.<br><br>
The final and most pertinent example, which I mentioned on Second Reading, is the way in which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 78</span>
the Government reduced the earnings allowance in 1987 and 1988. Earnings allowance is a benefit paid for the consequence of industrial injury or disease. It is paid to the target group to whom the Government wish to direct resources as the group with greatest need.<br><br>
The Government decided to freeze the allowance to be paid on retirement so that it stopped rising once someone was over retirement age. Not content with that, the Government cut the allowance by 75 per cent.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) was under the impression that nobody had lost money. Individuals who have now reached retirement age, the majority of whom receive the maximum rate of earnings allowance, have experienced a loss of income of about £19 a week. The Government's reason for cutting the allowance was that it was not right for benefit paid on account of earnings to continue after retirement age.<br><br>
The fact remains that the Government took that action. We therefore have good reason to be worried that they might decide to freeze the value of mobility allowance for all recipients. If they get away with that, they may decide to cut it, as they did with the earnings allowance, for recipients over retirement age.<br><br>
We attach considerable importance to the amendment and hope that the Minister will give us a crystal-clear assurance that the Government do not intend to claw back the cost of the improvement provided by the clause, which has been widely welcomed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to answer most of the points that have been raised in the course of this short discussion.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) reminded us, mobility allowance was introduced by the Labour party in 1975, largely as a replacement for invalid trikes. Those trikes were provided only to individuals who could drive, and the introduction of mobility allowance provided for the first time an allowance for drivers and non-drivers alike. Children under five were excluded, as the allowance was intended for adults of working age.<br><br>
Despite the immense growth in the take up of mobility allowance over the years, it has always been acknowledged that the resources have not been available to provide a benefit for everyone with mobility problems. That is why age limits have been in force. The Labour party introduced a cut off at the age of 75, which represented a sensible judgment that a sudden withdrawal of benefit at the age of 65 would cause considerable hardship. We have now reached the time when the first people to receive the allowance will lose it because they have reached the age limit.<br><br>
We thought it sensible, as an interim measure, to remove that danger for the foreseeable future by setting an arbitrary age limit of 80. However, I accept that it will be overtaken by our judgment about the future of the mobility allowance, when we have the results of the OPCS survey.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0066">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 79</span>
The amendment seeks to remove the age limit. That would have enormous financial consequences. Extending the allowance for existing recipients may not necessarily have tremendous resource implications, but if we remove the qualifying age of 65 entirely, it would cost about £1 billion. Therefore it is important to consider, in the light of the OPCS survey, whether that would be the most appropriate use of resources.<br><br>
