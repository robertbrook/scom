UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT: REQUIREMENT TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT ACTIVELY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><i>Amendment proposed </i>[<i>26 January],</i> No. 27, in page 4, line 37, after "7", to insert the words—"(1AA) Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Secretary of State shall make and lay before Parliament a report on the operation of the 'genuinely seeking work' condition of entitlement to unemployment insurance benefit between 1924 and 1930."—<i>[Mr. Flynn.]</i></p>
<p><i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome you back, Mr. Winterton, and offer you our sympathy that you were deprived of the undiluted joy of attending this Committee. We look forward to sharing that pleasure with you in the coming weeks—perhaps months.<br><br>
I shall conclude my remarks on the amendment fairly speedily. Our intention is to try to persuade the Government to accept the clear lesson of history and the lesson from the 1920s to 1930 of the turmoil, confusion, unhappiness, humiliation and futility of a similar clause in that unhappy and bewildering decade.<br><br>
The Government have not tried to deny that they are repeating history. The Conservative party briefing document says, on question 14:
<br><blockquote><p>"Is this a new idea?"</p></blockquote>
The answer is:
<br><blockquote><p>"No, similar provisions applied up to 1933."</p></blockquote>
The Minister disagreed that this was an alien concept. We are putting it to the Government that it is alien to our history because the assumption is made that all the unemployed are guilty and are shirkers, unless they prove that they are not. The onus is placed on the unemployed person to do that.<br><br>
We welcome the Government's repeating some of the features of the Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Act because when that Act came into force, although one part of it might well be seen as a retrograde step, its major features were progressive and beneficial. We recommend the Minister to emulate the reforms
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 160</span>
that took place then. In that Act, the Government undertook to provide benefit that was unlimited in duration, free of any means test and yet did not depend on the prior payment of more than a nominal number of contributions. The rise in rates of benefit in real terms was 155 per cent. over the rates paid four years earlier in 1920. If the Minister will make a similar proposal to add an additional clause to the Bill, we should accept that with our normal magnanimity.<br><br>
The parallel with the 1930s is a clear one. I have some of the report of the debate that took place in 1927, when it was considered by a Committee of the whole House. At that time, it took 27 hours to consider clause 5, as it was then, in more than seven days of debate. While I do not intend to quote from it at great length, I shall quote just two brief comments which illustrate how intimately analagous their thinking and their words at the time were to the debate that we are having now and shall have in the next few days.<br><br>
Mr. Betterton said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Our point is, that a genuinely unemployed man ought not to be hampered by a condition, whether in the Bill or 1924 or any other Measure, which has been so interpreted as to refuse benefits to genuinely unemployed men. Cases have been reported over and over again in which a man has produced written evidence from a foreman to whom he has applied for work, and even then committees have decided that those men have not been genuinely seeking work. We have plenty of evidence to show that the condition has been interpreted in that way, and I think it is the duty of this Committee so to arrange matters that genuinely unemployed working men shall not be refused benefits simply at the whim of a committee which will not accept the evidence of a foreman that a man has been seeking work. After all, it is the right of an unemployed man to have benefits unless somebody can prove that he has not tried to get work."—<i>[Official Report,</i> 28 November 1987; Vol 211, c. 78.]</p></blockquote>
Mr. Greenwood said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We say that the people who are genuinely out of work ought to receive benefit, and that the onus of proof in such cases ought to rest upon the Ministry, who have it in their power to deprive them of benefit. There is only one real test, and that is to offer a man suitable employment. That is the real test. We would agree that if a man refused to accept suitable employment he ought no longer to be eligible for benefit."—<i>[Official Report.</i> 28 November 1927, Vol. 211, c. 78–93.]</p></blockquote>
Those attitudes closely parallel our views.<br><br>
The task then came down to making an accurate assessment of the applicant's state of mind, a purely subjective decision. Our task here—similarly impenetrable—is to try to assess the state of mind of the Government. We have few clues from what we have heard so far. We know that their judgments are distorted by apocryphal stories, as they Were in the past. It was not the two Jaguars outside the council house but the legendary figure of a lady in a limousine, dressed in a black fur coat, who turned up to claim benefit from every office in the country. That story spread like measles—like an epidemic —and everyone believed the myth at the time.<br><br>
For the past 10 years, the Government have been distraught, tormented by the portentous nightmare of hordes of unemployed stealing the bread from out of the mouths of deprived millionaires. It is persistent, permanent quest for an unholy Grail, continued throughout the ages. The book from which we have drawn most of our history, by Mr. Alan
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0113">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 161</span>
Deakin, is significantly entitled "In Search of the Scrounger". It is a detailed account of the permanence of that quest, and of how it is continued. Once that idea is established, almost always based on apocryphal stories, it sticks in the mind. There was a serious examination, far more impressive than the anecdotal evidence that we have heard, and that investigation showed that the numbers of people who were workshy and cheating the system are very few, and they would not be caught by the clause.<br><br>
The Government tell us that the unemployed are scroungers, because the <i>Evening Standard</i> told them so. They know it, because a man on the Clapham omnibus told them so, and they know that the unemployed are getting free holidays abroad, free furniture, televisions, winter clothes, because they saw that on television too. A Yiddish proverb is, "For example is no proof. We should like to see the Government for once making an objective scientific assessment of those who are cheating the system, rather than what we see happening now, when the Government's mind has been lobotomised by fable and ignorance, and cut off from reality by wish-fulfilling fantasies, and misinformed by a process of defective reasoning—or am I being too kind?<br><br>
The answers given so far allow us to make that subjective judgment of the state of the Government's mind, not so much from what they say now as from what they have said before. Perhaps we shall hear something more informed. The Government do not say that the clause is good sense or fair, or that it is essential because the national insurance fund is strapped for money or because of a rising tide of unemployment. They say that it is popular, and that it fits in with the grain of public opinion. We take popularity to be the Government's supreme goal, because popularity means votes, and votes mean survival. They care about the unemployed, but many more times over for their own survival and political skins.<br><br>
The amendment should be looked at against history. The folly of the clause glares back at us. The lesson of history is that a national coalition and every Government since then have renounced this folly; it is large and obvious. All Governments since then have stayed on the path of seeking common sense, fairness and balance. The Government are returning to the error like a drug addict returning to his needle. By the clause they actively seek popularity, for themselves, but humiliation and resentment for others.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Gillian Shephard <span class='memberconstituency'>(Norfolk, South-West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were mesmerised by the poetry of the presentation of the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). Does he accept that there is a discrepancy in areas of high employment between the numbers of people who are claiming unemployment benefit and the number of vacancies that cannot be filled? The vacancies range from skilled and unskilled to manual jobs and those requiring qualifications. He and his hon. Friends need to ask themselves whether the present system is working as it should. I feel that it is not.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 162</span>
I fully accept that among the large numbers of people claiming unemployment benefit, there may be some who, for one reason or another, are unfit for work. Problems also exist in computing the numbers on the roll over between job vacancies and jobs being filled, so the numbers of people claiming unemployment benefit at any time will not necessarily be accurate. They cannot, however, be as inaccurate as they appear to be, certainly in a constituency like mine. It follows that some people on the list of those claiming benefit do not wish to work and some are working in the black economy, but do not wish to apply for an another job. The numbers may not be large, but they exist.<br><br>
While I enjoyed the history lesson given by the hon. Gentleman in his inimitable style, the fact that he chose to give a history lesson should remind him that in very many parts of the country the employment situation is vastly different from that of the 1920s and the 1930s.<br><br>
I am concerned, however, about one matter and hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to set my fear at rest. People of 55 and over, even where there is full employment, have difficulty in finding work. My constituents tell me that if they state their age when they apply for jobs, they do not receive replies from employers. It is important that that should be considered when the regulations are applied. After all, the procedure proposed in the Bill should help people in that category, by showing that they are genuinely looking for work and enabling pressure to be put on employers who are making this unfair discrimination against people who have a great deal of experience and expertise to offer. I hope that when my hon. Friend replies, he will respond to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like briefly to suport the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. Shephard). My constituency is on the opposite side of the country from hers, but it also enjoys a high level of employment and a relatively low level of unemployment.<br><br>
10.45 am<br><br>
I support the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West about the over-55s. As Member for Parliament for Taunton for the past 20 months, that is the one group I have found difficulty in helping or placing. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will address that point. Otherwise, I strongly support the Government on this. A point that the Committee will need to take into account is that the economy is moving into a period of a fast diminishing supply of labour because of the lower number of young people coming on to the labour market. Already, in my hon. Friend's part of the country, east anglia, right across the south and in certain cases in the midlands and the other industrial areas, we are encountering skill and other labour shortages, which inhibit our ability to compete and perform effectively. In my local newspaper, and no doubt in my hon. Friend's local newspaper, there are pages of advertisements for jobs that we hear are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0114">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 163</span>
difficult to fill. The other week, a constituent wrote to me about the way in which social security rules were affecting him. He described himself as long-term unemployed. I shall not name him or comment on his case. From his writing, he seemed relatively young and he did not say anything about a disability. The two factors that make employment difficult to find are disability or age. I am suspicious when someone in an area of high employment like Taunton describes himself in the present economic climate as long-term unemployed. Therefore, I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister would take these points into account when he replies.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not cover the many arguments that the hon. Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. Shephard), made on Second Reading because they are outside the range of the amendment. I should be happy to go into them in great detail, as we have been invited to do so.<br><br>
I take up the points that there is correlation between vacancies and unemployed, about people moving into the vacancies, are moving from one job to another and that there is a great deal of deception in the apparent simplicity of saying that there is X number of unemployed and X vacancies and it is a simple matter to put them together. That is not true and we should like to develop that.<br><br>
We are glad that the Government have discovered that there is a problem about retirement and age. We were impressed by the leading article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> saying that the Minister of State, Department of Employment is to challenge the idea that people retire at 60 or 65. The Government are to present this thrilling idea to the population. We remember that they reduced the age limits to 55 and 60 to satisfy their thirst for achieving their main intention of apparently reducing the unemployment figures. They have used 22 methods to reduce the unemployment totals without creating jobs, one of which is to classify those in their late 50s and early 60s as not unemployed but retired.<br><br>
The hon. Lady might like a discussion on the Act which has been in force in America since 1967, the Age Discrimination Act, under which it is illegal to turn down an applicant for a job on the grounds of age. That is very much part of our thinking. Although I cannot commit the next Labour Government, I am certain that something very similar will be part of our manifesto. We want people to enjoy a good old age, not two Health Services or two kinds of pensions. A Government who have cruelly cheated the old by depriving them of their basic pensions have no right to claim to defend the elderly and offer them that bright prospect. They cannot claim that by a single press release, and we look forward to seeing which party will offer the elderly a rich, fulfilling old age. It will mean a large programme of education and retraining for the over-50s and over-60s.<br><br>
I shall not dwell on that, Mr. Winterton. I may already have taxed your patience. The amendment is very much about the history and the lesson that comes through clearly and eloquently from the 1920s.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Member for Newport, West
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 164</span>
(Mr. Flynn) should have declared an interest when he talked about the next Labour Government and discrimination on the ground of age. By the time that there is another Labour Government, even he may have an interest.<br><br>
Before I deal with individual points, perhaps I may combine an explanation to the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) with an apology to the Committee. I wrote a letter about the clause and I am afraid that the word processor went mad. In my anxiety to get the letter out as quickly as possible I may have caused some confusion. On page 1, four lines from the bottom, all the words on that line except "in" should be deleted. The sentence should end at the previous line with a full stop after "benefit".<br><br>
In line 3 on page 2 the word "but" should read "test". That part of the sentence would then read:
<br><blockquote><p>"reminding him of the need to satisfy the 'actively seeking employment' test if he is to continue to receive benefit".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Lady said that we had decided not to use regulation-making power to deem someone to be actively seeking work when a doubt about his job-seeking activity arises during the course of a claim. That is being specifically addressed on amendment No. 60, and it would be better to deal with it on that amendment than to go over the background now.<br><br>
Before I reply to the individual points raised during this wide-ranging debate, it is worth briefly restating the principle of the clause. I agree very much with my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South West (Mrs. Shephard) that in no way is what we are doing analogous with the history lesson, often entertaining and always informative, that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends gave us.<br><br>
The principle at the heart of the clause is that the State rightly accepts a duty to provide benefit for the unemployed under an insurance scheme; if their unemployment is longer than the insurance period, to provide income support for those without other means; and to provide advice, guidance and encouragement for the unemployed. While it accepts the responsibility, as far as is compatible with broader economic aims, to create an environment of enterprise and job creation, the State is entitled in return to expect individuals to take the trouble actively to seek work. This is not, as was suggested in two passionate speeches from Opposition Members at the last sitting, some monstrous imposition on the unemployed. It is a genuine effort to provide a path from the misery of unemployment towards self-respect and the ability of individuals to provide for themselves and their families.<br><br>
We are seeking to encourage the unemployed back to work and to encourage them to adopt a more active job search. Both the Government and the claimants can be active. The Government have accepted the responsibility to be active and they have a right to expect claimants to be active rather than passive.<br><br>
The training initiatives introduced by the Government have shown our commitment to helping people to fit themselves for today's labour market.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0115">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 165</span>
Experience suggests, as has been said before in Committee, that the unemployed do not always undertake an effective job search. Job clubs and restart courses designed to help people to find work can direct their energies more effectively. The aim is to get people back to work sooner.<br><br>
I think that it was the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) who said that the longer one is unemployed the harder it is to get back into work. The more flexible and effective action that can be taken in the early weeks of unemployment to get people back into work, the shorter should be the duration of unemployment experienced by individuals. I do not believe that in their hearts the Opposition can disagree with that.<br><br>
I welcome the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) to the Committee because I was about to mention his contribution, to which I alluded earlier. It was a speech of great passion and commitment. The only disappointment was that he described himself as being "without power or influence". As he recited his sustained faith in the tired old nostrums of the last Labour Government and their failed solutions, I was hoping that he could persuade his Front Bench spokesmen to follow his line so that the next election might be even easier than it promises to be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie <span class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not as good as the first joke.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One cannot keep up the standard all the time.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman accused the Government of fiddling the unemployment figures, which I cannot accept. If we look at the international comparisons and the internationally-accepted measures of employment, the figures in spring 1987, as measured by the International Labour Organisation and the OECD, were 70,000 lower than the claimant count in this country as we measure it. The international measurement has been falling, not since 1986 when the claimant count in this country began to fall, but since some two years earlier.<br><br>
The OECD's published unemployment rate for the United Kingdom, estimated on its standard definition in November last year, was 7.6 per cent. compared with our 7.5 per cent., a minimal difference. Any suggestion about more accurate measures and that in some sense we are trying to fiddle the books, does not stand up to examination.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are in Committee. We do not have to panic about getting in. I shall give way in a moment. Anyone who travels around this country can see how unemployment is falling and prosperity is growing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn <span class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for my lateness. It was not the fault of the tube this morning. I had to go back for my diary, otherwise I should not have known what to do for the rest of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 166</span>
day. I should lose my sense of direction without it. It is like a totem pole.<br><br>
Surely, the problem is that the publication of unemployment statistics by the Government is based essentially on those claiming benefit, and that the changes have always involved registering those people who claimed benefits? I am sure that he is aware that the restart interviews have resulted in a number of people being denied benefit. Therefore, they are depending on someone else who is without benefit. They do not count as being unemployed or employed.<br><br>
The Government have demonstrated that the number of people receiving benefit is decreasing. I do not deny that, but I ask the Minister to consider the number of people who are out of work and not in receipt of benefit, and who therefore do not appear in any statistics. I believe that it is a significant number, particularly in a community such as that I represent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The point that I wanted to make to the Minister was not that there is evidence of increasing prosperity in this country—that is something I have put on record here and in the Chamber, and it is prosperity that is now at risk, given the way the Government are trying to deal with the balance of payments problem—but that he was confusing two points. The first, is whether the way we now measure unemployment tallies with the way international bodies think we should measure it, and secondly, whether the measurement in this country has changed over time, and that the number of unemployed has fallen as a result of changes in the measurement index. That is totally separate from the number of unemployed falling as a result of the rise in prosperity.<br><br>
Our case is not that we should not have other measurements or that we should not bring it into line with what the OECD says—it is rather nice to see the Government commending an international organisation to us—</span></p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will it be the ILO next?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are several others. That issue is separate from saying that the Government have cooked the figures and have therefore magnified the fall in unemployment since 1981. The two points can stand side by side; they do not contradict each other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have confirmation from the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) that unemployment has been falling and is continuing to fall. We can see that with our own eyes. We have our measure of unemployment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Clare Short <span class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult enough not to be enraged by what is being said. There has been some decline in unemployment in recent years, but there is an enormous growth in part-time, low-paid work and such full-time work as there is—which is very little—is low-paid work for women. There is a continuing decline in full-time

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 167</span>
jobs for men and we have still not returned to the level of unemployment that the Government inherited in 1979.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady is repeating a point that she made in a lengthy speech to the Committee at the previous sitting. I am dealing with the fact that we now have our measure of unemployment in line with the international comparators, and it is right that it should be a measure of those who are fit and available for work. The people to whom the hon. Member for Islington, North has referred, who for one reason or another are not available for work, should be excluded. It is a distortion of the figures to include them in the unemployment count.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that our definition of unemployment is in line with an internationally accepted definition. Is he telling the Committee that we can therefore expect the Government not to introduce any other changes in the measurement of unemployment in Britain?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the responsibility of my colleagues in the Department of Employment. I certainly know of no further plans to refine the method, although it is conceivable that as techniques improve it will be possible to get even closer to the truth.<br><br>
The present count of 2.04 million unemployed is, I believe, as accurate a figure as we have ever achieved.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jimmy Wray <span class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Provan)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: What weight does the Minister place on the advice of the chief adjudication officer who examined the 1,000 cases and found that 17 per cent. had to be revised because of the true quality of adjudication?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It depends on how random the sample chosen by the chief adjudication officer was. In the Department of Social Security, let alone in the Department of Employment, we are always trying to refine the way in which statistics are gathered and to present them accurately. For example, the family expenditure survey, is based on 7,000 families across the country, and yet we have seen how misleading some of the conclusions drawn from that can be. However, it is the best that we have so far. We want to continue to improve our techniques and refine the information upon which Government base their decision making.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can I take the Minister back to the article in the <i>Employment Gazette</i> in spring 1987, which said that there were 730,000 people with no job and unable to claim benefit. On Second Reading the Secretary of State confirmed the figure of 730,000 and said that, of those, 360,000 did not even pretend to want a proper job or to work at all. I dispute the figure of 360,000, and I am surprised that he should make such a bald and wide statement. However, even if one accepted his figure, there would still be 370,000 excluded from the Secretary of State's description of those not wanting a job and therefore not seeking work. Therefore, presumably those 370,000—more
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 168</span>
than one third of a million—are without benefit, would like to have a job and are not included in the unemployment count. There has to be an internationally recognised comparison of employment and unemployment. However, the Government have the recognised standard for counting unemployment, they have their own standard for counting employment, and there is a big gap of 750,000 people in the middle. Those 750,000 people should be included in some definition. Also, if we had a decent social security system, nobody would be totally denied benefit in the way that the Government deny it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was seeking to show that the figures we have are as accurate as we can make them with out present techniques. They are in line with international figures.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'> <i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If we follow this line of debate it will not be productive or profitable for either side of the Committee.<br><br>
I was leading up to the fact that I accept that there is more work to do. Unemployment is still too high but the Government's policies will lead to it further—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the Minister, but we have talked about international definitions and I am sure that none of us would like the record to be distorted. The Minister must know that the guidelines from the ILO, which are used by the OECD for international comparisons of unemployment rates, include people who are available to start work within the next fortnight and have been seeking work at some time during the past four weeks. The 1986 Labour Force Survey—the 1987 survey has not yet been published—gives the figures, which are published by the Department of Employment, according to that international definition. They are considerably higher than our own unemployment figures, because they include people whether or not they are on benefits. It is a much broader category than will be allowed under the Bill. I simply want to put that on the record, because I am sure that the Minister would not care to mislead people.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that the figure is remarkably close to the one that we are using in this country. I understand that on a later amendment Opposition Members intend to debate the findings of the various surveys and I do not want to delay the Committee unduly on that now.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) raised the question of the long-term unemployed and their difficulty in competing with other people to obtain jobs. I recognise that that attitude exists among many employers, although as I think I mentioned— this point was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson)—attitudes among employers are now changing. As the unemployment picture becomes tight, employers will increasingly be looking to older and more experienced workers as part of their recruitment policy. The Tesco
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0117">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 169</span>
organisation, has a sustained employment recruitment campaign to find people aged 50 and over to work in its supermarkets. That is just the beginning of a process that will increasingly be followed by employers. I am sure that the rest of the Committee welcome that process as much as I do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged to hear that. Indeed, we have tabled amendments to the clause to encourage employers. The clause is directed towards the unemployed. The Minister rightly identified, as did the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Nicholson), the fact that it has been shown in the survey on which the Government have based the Bill, that some employers are not looking in the right place to find suitable people to employ. I hope from what the Minister has said that he will welcome our amendments, which place some duties on employers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not commit myself to that in advance of careful consideration of the Opposition's proposals. However, as it gets around that employers are looking for people in an older age group, the attitude of those older people will change. In the past, many of them have shrugged their shoulders in resignation and said "I'm 50"—I speak with some feeling, although I am a bit older than that—"and there is no chance now of getting another job". Therefore, they resign themselves to unemployment until they reach retirement age. That is a pity. The more that employers can be encouraged to advertise for older people for the work force, the more it will encourage people to seek re-employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Government positively encourage older workers to apply for jobs in the Department of Social Security?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a management matter for the Department, but I have discussed it with those responsible for personnel policies in the DSS. The hon. Gentleman knows that we have difficulty in recruiting and retaining staff. Often we recruit and train staff who then become attractive to local authorities, banks, building societies and other employers. That leads to a high turnover of staff and an unacceptably low level of service in some places. I shall ask our personnel staff to explore the possibility of attracting older people to work for the DSS. It would help us to give a better service to the public than we are often currently able to do.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) accused the Government of being glib in advocating the clause and said that it was likely to penalise the genuine seeker after work. I do not think that that is so. The interests of the genuine claimants will be safeguarded by the clause, and only those who are not prepared to take active steps to get back into employment could be damaged. Our benefit officers will not be misled by easy explanation of what people claim they may have done. They will be able to look beyond that. They are worldly wise and will be able to see through the glib excuses and decide whether people are actively seeking work.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 170</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why, after 10 years of these perceptive officers interrogating the unemployed, is this punitive, odorous clause necessary? Why have these officers not sorted peope out by their harsh tests, especially for restart?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I dealt with that on Second Reading, but I shall do so again. All that is required is the passive state of availability, not the condition of actively seeking work that is contained in the clause.<br><br>
Some hon Members have suggested that change is unnecessary because in practice it has already happened. They quoted a judgment of the commissioner. Since that ruling, however, a series of other rulings have been given, and they mke it clear that only a passive state is required: one needs simply to be available for work, not actively seeking it. The hon. Member for Newport, West also said that is was an alien idea. As I have said, many other countries have similar or tougher provisions. The idea is not alien if he is suggesting that it is out of tune with what the British people expect us to do when confronted by people, when employment is rapidly improving, who are not prepared to take active steps to get back to work.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman alluded to the matter as though I, or Conservative Members, are accusing the majority of unemployed of being workshy and unwilling to return to work. I refuted that on Second Reading and in the Committee. Only a minority of people will need to be encouraged by the provision.<br><br>
The hon. Members for Derby, South referred to the problem, which is not unique, of less articulate people who are seeking work or attending interviews at unemployment officers, and are fearful of officialdom and find it difficult to cope with such situations. The problem is not new to the Department of Employment or to the Department of Social Security. But the continued guidance and training of staff, we seek to ensure that staff can respond to the inarticulate, to those with linguistic difficulties, to the illiterate and to others who have difficulty in presenting themselves effectively.</span></p>
<p>11.15 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that availability for work is very misleading in the RR6 form? An adjudication officer refused benefit because someone had put on that form that the wage required was £175. The officer did not ask whether it was negotiable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On Second Reading I quoted a case of someone who went to a job centre and left without giving his name and address. That had been regarded as being available for work. That is not the approach to getting back into employment that we want to see, or what the vast majority of people would expect us to encourage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is saying that in the one case he cites the present system did not work properly. That has damn all to do with the need to change the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not mean that. There was a series of cases making it clear that it is a passive state of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0118">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 171</span>
availability and not the active state that we seek to promote in the clause that is necessary to qualify for benefit. There may be a clear division in the Committee on this. There should not be, and if that is the attitude of the Opposition we should have it clearly established.<br><br>
There are substantial differences between what existed in the 1920s—about which we have had such an effective lesson in the course of the Committee—and what exists now. The system of social security appeals tribunals the commissioners and the courts is now available to people who feel that they have been unfairly treated, whereas in the 1920s that path was not open to them. The hon. Member for Newport, West said that in the period that he was alluding to there was little guidance and advice available to the unemployed. That may have been true then but it manifestly is not true now. Counselling is available from the beginning of a period of unemployment. Claimant advisers have been steadily increasing in recent months. There will be 1,200 by the end of March and 2,000 new client advisers have been specially appointed in order to deal with the newly unemployed. They will be able to offer a wide range of advice and counselling.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a bit surprised by what the Minister says. The last time we discussed the matter I heard that some rights of appeal were being removed from claimants and power handed to officials. The Minister spoke about advisers. In many places advice services have been severely cut because of local authority expenditure cuts, and that means that claimants are entirely dependent on advice received from the Department.<br><br>
While the Minister is considering advisers, will he bear in mind that it is necessary for much better translation and language facilities to be made available in some offices, particularly in inner city areas such as mine where there is a lack of translation facilities?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do bear that in mind. We and the Department of Employment are keen that this should be possible. A short time ago I looked at a machine being considered by the employment service. I do not know whether it has been adopted, but it was to be available not only in job centres but in social centres and so on for use by the Asian community. Explanations about employment services and the help and advice available could be produced on a screen in Gujerati, Urdu, Hindi and other Asian languages. That is an excellent move. We should encourage the spread of that sort of information and it should not be necessary to go to the job centre to get it. I hope that we can move in that direction.<br><br>
I am not saying that there have been no adjustments to the appeal system, but one cannot compare the rights that claimants now have if they feel that they have been unfairly treated with those that existed in the 1920s. We now have better appeals procedures and better advice and counselling.<br><br>
Whatever the hon. Member for Newport, West may say, we are not seeking to find out the state of mind of the claimant. We are trying to find out
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 172</span>
whether he is taking certain action and actively seeking work. That is the essence of the difference between what was happening then and what is happening now. We are not sending people to look for work when we know very well that there is no work available. The hon. Gentleman gave graphic examples of what used to happen. That does not happen now.<br><br>
Mr. Winterton, I do not want to delay the Committee unduly. I have said several times that it is right that the claimant should take the initiative in looking for work. We chose the word "actively" deliberately to enshrine the concept of what we are seeking to achieve. A person should not be able to sit back and hope for a job to be offered to him. He should continually be considering how best to find work and pursuing every appropriate opportunity. The Opposition oppose our proposals, and the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) in particular, takes a serious interest in all such matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We all do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in the interests not only of the economy as a whole, but in the interests of the people concerned actively to seek work. In a way, the Opposition Front-Bench spokesmen seem to be turning their backs on the unemployed and writing them off. As more and more job opportunities become available, and will continue to become available, we should give every encouragement and persuasion to unemployed people to say, "Times are changing. There are new job opportunities. Our task now is to go out and find the jobs that suit us."<br><br>
I accept that not everyone who wants a job can find one, but, increasingly, more people will be able to. This is to be an important encouragement to them to get back into employment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Clare Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to rise, Mr. Winterton, especially as I was not here for the early speeches by my hon. Friends. I lost my envelope with all my papers and all the time it was on the chair at my desk. I know that the Minister is an honourable man compared with many of his colleagues in the Conservative party, but I do not think that he understands the way in which the system for which he is, in theory, responsible currently works. If he did he would not speak as he has spoken this morning.<br><br>
On Friday night I was at a meeting of the Birmingham tribunal representation unit, an organisation that seeks to appeal on behalf of people tangled up in the social security system in Birmingham and to train those who represent them. Some of the unemployed people at that meeting who were intelligent and articulate talked about the way in which they had started to become frightened of the restart interviews. People who were working as volunteers and doing good work for other people in the city said that they were frightened that they would be forced on to employment training schemes to do crass work that they did not want to do.<br><br>
These were people of ability, competence and considerable social commitment. One after another they talked about the process, the traps and the degree
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0119">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 173</span>
of fear, and many of them said that they had given up in the end and accepted employment training.<br><br>
The Minister misdescribes the position that he must know about because his Government have brought in a whole series of new measures. I believe that his Department's slogan is "placement before payment". If he looks at the brochures and advice to his staff, he will find that that slogan was put together for his Department by, no doubt, some expensive advertising agency.<br><br>
People have to fill in a long questionnaire about what they have done, what level of pay they are willing to accept, and they are then supposed to have an interview with offers of placement. We are not talking of jobs. That is the horror of this. If one looks at the statistics, the overwhelming majority of offers are for job clubs, employment training or short one-week restart courses. People would love a job but they hate being forced into all this stuff that they do not believe will lead them anywhere and which is often unsuitable. That is the first hurdle to be surmounted.<br><br>
The Minister misleads the Committee. The instructions given to supervisors in unemployment benefit offices state that, if a doubt arises as to a claimant's availability, the employment service will make inquiries to ascertain what active steps the claimant has taken to draw attention to his unemployment and professed availability. The claimant will be asked if he has registered for work at a jobcentre or employment agency and if not, why not; if he has applied for any jobs and if not, why not; if he has checked newspapers, circulars or magazines and if not, why not; how frequently he has searched or applied for work; and so on. That is not the case. The Minister said a few moments ago that a person does not have to show in any way that he seeks work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not suggesting for one moment that the Department of Employment does not ask a person what steps he is taking to seek work, to encourage him to do so. The state of law does not enable the Department to warn people that unless they take those steps, they will no longer qualify for benefit. That is the change that we are introducing. We do not want benefit to be withdrawn, but we want to encourage people to take steps to get back into employment. It is right that those offices should have the power to say that, unless a person does this, he will no longer qualify for benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but the Minister does not seem to know that if a person has been unemployed for six months, he is sent a letter which invites him to a restart interview, and that if he does not attend his benefit may be stopped. The Minister has just told us that the Department cannot warn people that their benefit may be stopped. It warns everyone. It sends letters and people are frightened. They then have to complete another detailed questionnaire about what they have done and what they are willing to apply for and then they must attend a restart interview, under the threat of withdrawal of benefit.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 174</span>
That is how this is experienced and feared. That letter is sent to everyone who has been unemployed for six months. The overwhelming majority of offers to people involve restart interviews, job clubs, employment training and so on.<br><br>
What do we have at the moment? Trial plans to follow up the people who expressed an interest in an offer at a restart interview. We are talking not about real jobs, but one of these low-paid schemes which for most people do not lead anywhere. A person may be interested in employment training or a job club, but if he does not go back to it, there is a pilot scheme, which I understand may be universalised, to get him back in another few months to find out why he did not take up a place.<br><br>
I could continue, Mr. Winterton, but I do not wish to detain the Committee. I find it unbearable to hear the Minister who is responsible for all these matters wrongly suggesting that the unemployed are not pressured into accepting these courses.<br><br>
Other research shows that the majority of people who after their restart interviews take up job clubs, one-week restart courses and so on think that it is compulsory and that their benefit will be withdrawn if they do not do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). She talked about a group of people whom she met earlier this week, some of whom carry out important voluntary work. Am I to assume that she feels that such a person should be able to choose whether or not he does voluntary work supported by people who are working, in other words by benefit, or go out and take a job?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously the hon. Gentleman was not listening—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Favell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was listening.</span></p>
<p>11.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The person in question was being pressured into employment training. It is meant to be a training scheme and is funded at extremely low levels. Most serious commentators on training do not believe that it will provide serious training or enhance anyone's skills. Certainly throughout the controversy of its introduction and throughout the passage of the Employment Bill we were reassured, time and again, that it would be a voluntary scheme.<br><br>
I am talking about an individual who wants work but cannot find it at his level of skills and competence. He does quality work, counselling and helping people. He is constantly pressurised to go on a low-level employment training scheme, for which he will have benefit plus £10 a week. I am talking not about someone who could otherwise have a job, but about the man who would like a job but does notwant to go on an employment training scheme, and thinks that his voluntary work is more important, makes a better contribution to society, and is in every way preferable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must all sometimes wonder whether our memories are at fault or whether we did
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0120">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 175</span>
not say what we thought we said. My hon. Friend made it extremely clear, though the hon. Gentleman obviously did not take it in, that these are people who are not being and never have been offered jobs, and who would like nothing better.<br><br>
Many of those who do the sort of work that she described—the voluntary and community programme work—do so not only because they find it satisfying and fulfilling, but because they hope against hope that, by doing it, they will find the opportunity of a job where, in theory, there is no job at the moment. It is precisely because they want jobs that they are anxious to engage in something that is of value in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Indeed, the advice given by projects in areas where unemployment is a problem is that those who cannot find a job should try a job club. The advantages are discussed. Better still, if there is an area of work that they want to work towards, if they can get in and do voluntary work for a time, their chances of finding employment will increase enormously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that it is disheartening for the unemployed? According to a survey, for 476 jobs in 1988 offered by job clubs, it took 14,290 telephone calls, 50,081 letters, 1,432 visits and 8,921 job advertisements?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Absolutely. I am not knocking job clubs. Some people are grateful for them, the free telephone calls and supportive networks. But the job applications are speculative. Under the Government's plans for job clubs, they expect more than 8 million letters from job clubs in order to produce about 150,000 jobs, though I speak from memory.<br><br>
I do not want to make a long speech. I merely wish to correct the Minister's misleading description of the current situation. He talks as though there is not enormous pressure on people to prove that they are seeking work and as if they are not forced to take places on schemes and jobs that are not satisfactory. The unemployment benefit office in Handsworth, in my constituency, has recently been rebuilt. A few months ago I talked to the staff there about what they did when people asked for a higher wage level than the current level in the area. I asked whether, given the history of Handsworth and some of the terrible troubles on the streets, there was any greater sensitivity; whether the staff were told that they could have a little more discretion; and whether there was any worry that pushing people too hard might lead to more trouble in the streets, which we certainly do not want. They said, "We use our discretion. If people enter a wage that is not acceptable, we advise them what it would be better to say." Already the system is so tight that sometimes officers in areas of social conflict and sensitivity are interpreting the rules a little more softly in order not to have aggro across the counter.<br><br>
That is the present position, we shall move on to people being forced to show each and every week that they have applied for jobs. The Government
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 176</span>
strategy that underpins the move is to force people to accept low-paid jobs as clause 9, taken with clause 7, demonstrates. For the Minister to pretend that it is a free and easy system and that people do not apply for jobs, is misleading to older workers, who are demoralised and need encouragement yet they, too, are subject to a restart questionnaire. The Minister either deliberately misleads the Committee—which I do not believe—or does not understand the way in which his own system operates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is in order for the state to change the rules that lay down the rules of eligibility for benefit. In a perfect society, many of the changes that the Government propose should be welcomed. There is a danger that hon. Members on both sides of the Committee may listen only to those whose views fit in with their own prejudices or principles. I am struck by the difference between what unemployed people tell me and what some of the campaigning organisations for the unemployed claim that the unemployed are saying. It is valuable, therefore, to have a group such as ACTION for the long-term unemployed. Instead of meeting carefully selected groups of the long-term unemployed who come to centres, who may be all of one sort, it goes out to talk to the punters, chosen on a random basis. The group's findings differ very much from many of the results from the pressure groups on this issue.<br><br>
The long-term unemployed are clearly saying that the Government have a right to insist that they actively seek work and that they are anxious to go on training programmes. They are concerned primarily not about the level of pay but about the quality of their training and where it might lead. The Government stand condemned not because of their campaign of roughing up the unemployed—they have a long record on that— but because they are not prepared to change their side of the bargain in terms of what is offered to those people when pressure is applied to them.<br><br>
I accept that it is proper to apply pressure. Pressure needs to be applied to some of our constituents. As I say that, into my mind's eye come the faces of people who have not had pressure put on them, but should have. I oppose unemployment and poverty, not because that is a warm overcoat that people like to put on and shuffle around happily in, but because it destroys them. That is why we want exits from it.<br><br>
We must ask what the Government are doing on their side of the bargain, now that they are renegotiating the contract between the unemployed and the state. We know from the records of our constituencies that for long periods the long-term sick were kicked off invalidity benefit on to unemployment benefit, because it saved the Government money. Now the Government have realised that, by applying that policy, the self same people are appearing in the unemployment figures, so now they are being kicked back on to sickness and invalidity benefit to make them disappear from the unemployment figures. The Minister calls that a "refinement"—one of the useful expressions that he has developed with such skill on the Committee. Those on the receiving end have another view.<br><br>

The Government are lacking not because they do not have the right to renegotiate the deal between the unemployed and the state but because it is selfish, one-way renegotiation. We need to look at their track record. Ernie Bevin used to say that one should not bother to read what a motion says but should just look at the bottom, at the names of those moving it.<br><br>
At the bottom of the clause is the Government. Their record has been one of tightening up, making it increasingly difficult for people to draw benefit and sit on their backsides. I am not against that. But the Government have been totally unprepared to see how we as a community can radically improve the quality of the training that we offer and make sure that, when people have been through all the hoops described by my hon Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), which I agree people should go through, they are not just kicked back to the unemployment registers if they fail. A huge gap of people do not find work at the end of all that, and are left to swim on their own, instead of the Government saying, "We are committed to you. We will see you through. There will be some form of temporary work so that you do not go back on the unemployment register." That is the charge that I make about the Government, not the roughing-up charge, which we have long expected from this Administration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the interests of progress, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 28, in page 4, line 39, leave out from "below" to the end of line 41.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take the following amendments:
No. 29, in page 4, line 40, leave out "actively".<br><br>
No. 30, in page 4, line 46, leave out "actively".<br><br>
No. 31, in page 5, line 5, leave out "actively".<br><br>
No. 32, in page 5, line 9, leave out "actively".<br><br>
No. 33, in page 5, line 14, leave out "actively".<br><br>
Bearing in mind the length of the previous debate, I intended to tell the Committee that my co-Chairman and I have allowed a broad debate. It has strayed from the amendment, but I felt that it was a fundamental amendment and, therefore, allowed considerable discretion. I must now ask members of the Committee to relate their remarks directly to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is timely to move on to this amendment, because we have perhaps strayed a little, and these amendments are directed to the heart of the Government's proposals, because they seek to remove the word "actively".<br><br>
As will become more and more evident, there is a gulf of experience and understanding between the two sides of the Committee. The Minister spoke of active rather than passive search being required and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 178</span>
said that the present law did not permit the enforcement of an active search. He spoke constantly about "effective job search" and the need to encourage unemployed people into effective job search. But, if that is what the Government want to do, the problem is that there is not the slightest need for them to change the law. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) said, nothing within the present law precludes the Government from enforcing the law with the greatest stringency. Indeed, experience suggests that that is precisely what they are doing. Nothing in the present law prevents the Government from seeking to encourage people—to use the Minister's words—to demonstrate the active steps that they are taking to look for work.<br><br>
Two key points come up in our debates over and again. The Minister suggests that encouragement is needed and that, therefore, we must change the law. At the same time when he was being polite to the Committee, he referred to the tiny minority who need encouragement. Indeed, my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) talked about a small number of people in his knowledge and acquaintance who needed a little more shoving to make efforts to get back into work. Although the Government claim that it is only a tiny minority, it is not only a tiny minority. Every unemployed person will be affected by the Bill.<br><br>
The other point, which will be a central theme in the debate, is that Conservative Members constantly talk about the Bill in the context of jobs, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood said, we are not talking about offers of jobs or even about availability of jobs. We are talking about a test of what a person is doing, which does not involve anyone in any compulsion to offer him a job or give any opportunity to test that person's availability for work or activeness in seeking work.<br><br>
11.45 am<br><br>
That is the one thing that the Government are not prepared to write into the Bill, because they know perfectly well that they cannot deliver it. They are quite content to harass people to run around looking for jobs that may not exist, but they are not prepared to put themselves on the line and say that the test will be of an actual job offer, let alone the offer of a decent job. That is the great vacancy at the heart of the Government's argument.<br><br>
Nothing of what the Minister said about the last amendment showed why it was necessary to change the law. If all that the Government want to do is to encourage people who have drifted into a malaise of unemployment more effectively to seek work, nothing in the Minister's arguments shows any need to change the law. The Government's approach is rather strange. Although, when they are polite, Ministers talk about a tiny minority of the unemployed, it is noticeable that, as the debates go on, the direction of the debate on the Government side drifts, as it did on Second Reading, towards the workshy, as if all the unemployed are workshy, or are fundamentally to blame for their own unemployment. That is the basic attitude underlying this part of the Bill.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0122">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 179</span>
To say that an unemployed person must actively seek work and to test what that means week by week is a little like saying that if people claim sickness or invalidity benefit, they must show that they are actively seeking a cure for their illness. The assumption would be the same—that it is their fault that they are ill and, therefore, it is up to them to do something about it. The rest of society can stand back, because all that is required is that the individual should take steps, and jobs will be there.<br><br>
Whatever the Minister may say about the different ways of counting unemployment figures, whether it is the OECD standard or whether it is the Labour Force Survey of 1986, no amount of juggling the figures can produce a situation in which the number of theoretical vacancies, even on a simple numbers level, can come anywhere near the number of people who, by anybody's measure, are unemployed. It is offensive to imply that the unemployed are not actively looking for work and that they are not anxious to be in work but can be induced to seek work only by the threat of starvation. That is why we seek to remove the word "actively", which the Government appear to be using as a description of the tests that will be applied.<br><br>
The Minister said that there might be circumstances in which some account could be taken of hardship. The Minister made those remarks on an earlier amendment when we sought to remove the power to prosecute someone for failing to maintain himself and said that, in those circumstances, a reduced rate of income support might still have to be paid. Although such regulations exist, it is extremely unlikely that most of those who will be affected by the clause either know about them or are likely to know about them, and it is probably even less likely that they will benefit from them in any way.<br><br>
I recently tabled a question asking how often that power had been used, and the Under-Secretary was unable to tell me, which shows that perhaps it has not been widely used. Again, that is not surprising, as it was shoved into the amending regulations less than two weeks before income support started. That is another aspect about which it is far from clear what the Government's intentions will be.<br><br>
Does the active job search need to be written into the legislation, when only a tiny minority of people need to be put under that pressure? My hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) referred to people of his acquaintance who might benefit from a little pressure. The Minister referred to people who were reported as having said that they were not looking for work. I regard such remarks with a degree of suspicion, especially as on Second Reading, the Secretary of State said that 360,000 people were not looking for work. The Secretary of State either did not know or thought it was irrelevant that over half of the 220,000 men who made up that statistic were sick, disabled or retired. Perhaps the Secretary of State thought that it was of no importance. Opposition Members are concerned when Conservative Members say directly or imply that many people do not want to work at all.<br><br>
Only once have I met an individual who said bluntly and openly that he liked being unemployed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 180</span>
and had every intention to stay so for as long as he could. That was during the 1987 general election campaign, and I was canvassing at the time. He informed me also that, since he had every faith in Mrs. Thatcher's ability to keep him in that situation, he intended to vote Conservative.<br><br>
I am not sure where that leaves the Minister's argument, but he was quite sincere; he was not pulling my leg. It was not clear why he enjoyed being unemployed, but it was obvious that it was not because he spent his time looking after his house and garden. He is the only person I have ever met who said that he preferred being unemployed. He does nothing to help the Minister's case.<br><br>
I have, however, met many unemployed people who are asked how they are settling down, whether they have adjusted, or whether they find it difficult and depressing. They say, "It's not too bad now since I started doing things in the garden and have taken up this and that." I have always found in such circumstances that the unemployed person may say with a degree of defiance that it is not as bad as he or she thought. However, thereafter a member of the family or a friend says that the person is in a terrible state and minds desperately and bitterly being unemployed. Such people do not admit it, because they feel failures, and to admit that they hate being unemployed and have no success in finding work makes them feel worse.<br><br>
That is at the heart of my strong feelings about what the Government propose. The Minister talks of encouragement, but the clause allows for harassment. We are trying to probe why the Government feel that it is necessary to use that word.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) drew attention to people in job clubs and the number of applications that they have to make to receive any response. They have to make thousands of speculative phone calls and visits and write thousands of letters. Has the CBI taken account of what the Government intend should follow this clause?<br><br>
Many people seem to be actively looking for work. The basic problem is whether such work is available. The Minister sought to imply that, under the existing law, people either do not or do not have to take steps to look for work and that the law is too loose to allow a degree of pressure. A range of people come under pressure, not because they have been offered a job, but because the question of whether they are looking for or are really available for work has come up.<br><br>
Hon. Members were given the example of a young woman living on the south coast who, at her restart, interview lost her benefit. My hon. Friend's historical lessons are again relevant. How one fills in the questionnaires is important, as are the precise words that are used. That young woman had put down on her restart questionnaire that she was looking for a teaching job and would be willing to consider employment as a research assistant. She thought that she was putting down the type of job that she had the skill and experience to fulfil and that she would like to do. However, she did not give a comprehensive list of all the other jobs she would be willing to take if they were offered. That was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0123">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 181</span>
interpreted as a statement that she would work only as a teacher or research assistant. She said that at no time did she make such a statement. She was asked if she had applied for other jobs and she said yes, but that had not been put down. She had not been offered any other jobs. The suggestion was that although she said she was looking for work, she was not looking widely enough at different types of work.<br><br>
We have the example of someone who was disqualified from benefit, and I shall be interested to hear the Minister explain how that fits in with the definition of "actively seeking" work. The applicant filled in the form showing that he or she was looking for work five days a week from nine till five, but was disqualified from benefit on the ground that that was too restrictive.<br><br>
Someone who lives in a rural area was advised that she was not available for work unless she had a car, because there was insufficient public transport to make her available for work in the nearest town. It is not readily open to many unemployed people to obtain access to a car, unless they are fortunate enough to already have one and can afford to run it.<br><br>
That is how the law and the guidance are being interpreted. The Minister said that his officers would be under instructions to look at local conditions and so on. In my last example, where it was suggested that the lack of public transport meant that someone was not available for work, whether it was her fault or not, local conditions were taken into account, but not in quite the way that the Minister implied. The implication of what the Minister said to my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood on Second Reading was that if, for example, there were high levels of unemployment in the area, that would be taken into account. I think that my hon. Friend was meant to understand that in an area of high unemployment the pressure put on an individual might not be quite so great. Under existing law, there is considerable pressure, and decisions are made taking account of local circumstances, but perhaps not in the way that the Minister implied.<br><br>
There is a major flaw in the Government's thinking. I would argue—it remains to be seen whether my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) agrees—that even our present legislation, right though it is, should be administered with a greater degree of flexibility at times of high unemployment. The present legislation, put on the statute book by a Labour Government and intended to ensure that people cannot choose to be unemployed because they are lazy, works best in times of full employment, as does a range of other benefit penalties for people who are not in full-time employment, such as the full extent normal test and similar measures. That legislation is set against a background of relatively full employment.<br><br>
Against a background of high unemployment it is sensible and necessary for flexibility in the interpretation of existing legislation. Instead of that the Government are tightening the screws, and, because they believe that that is not sufficient, they intend, by the use of the words "actively seeking work", to tighten the screws even further. That is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 182</span>
simply a test to discover whether people should be paid benefit. There is no test as to whether they are being offered work, which should be the greatest importance.<br><br>
I should like to explore further what will be meant by the use of the word "actively". Will the Minister clarify whether any of the hardship provisions will apply, not that I find that very encouraging? A case was brought to my attention a couple of days ago of a young woman caught by last year's Bill, which deprived 16 to 18-year-olds of the right to benefit. We can see there the way in which the severe hardship clause sometimes works. Unfortunately, at the age of 17 she has become pregnant and is now five months pregnant. Nonetheless, because of the law passed last year she is denied any right to benefit unless she takes up a YTS placement.<br><br>
12.00 noon<br><br>
It is a little unfortunate, in view of the high moral tone that the Government have been taking lately about child care and such matters, that this five-months-pregnant girl has been told that she must take one of only two YTS placements available to her. One is on a painting and decorating course and the other is on a bricklaying course. I should really like to ask the Prime Minister which she would advise as being more suitable for the girl's condition, but I doubt whether the opportunity is likely to arise.<br><br>
Because that young woman is in the early stages of pregnancy, she does not qualify for any exception under the severe hardship rules. Only in the later stages of her pregnancy might it be considered that some difficulty might be caused if she had to continue with the course. Severe hardship, therefore, has to be very severe for the Government to be prepared to take action, and we should like to know whether the Government intend to run alongside the "actively seeking work" legislation in the way they run alongside the availability legislation now.<br><br>
Will the Minister tell us what the Government are likely to mean by someone "actively seeking work"? What does he intend should be in the regulations, which he says will not be comprehensive but will give examples? What instructions will be given to the officials who are expected to administer the regulations?<br><br>
The Minister will probably say that that is a matter for the adjudicating authorities and that he has no power to interfere. However, it would substantially assist the Committee, if we could have not only a draft or some idea of the content of the proposed regulations, but if the Minister would ask the chief adjudication officer, on behalf of the Committee, to tell us what instructions he would issue, based on what he understands the Government to intend in the regulations.<br><br>
There is a strict principle at stake. It appears that the thrust of the legislation is likely to mean that someone will be judged guilty and have to prove himself innocent, which is the reverse of the principle in our courts. It is vital, therefore, that we should see how this part of the Bill is likely to operate before the Committee comes to a decision either on the amendment or the clause.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0124">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 183</span>
I shall give a couple of examples of questions that come to mind about the "actively" provision. According to the legislation, the active job search will be a week-by-week matter. If someone applies for a job in five weeks out of six but does not apply for one in the sixth week because he is sick of making hundreds of fruitless telephone calls and sending hundreds of letters to which he receives no acknowledgment or reply, will he lose benefit in the sixth week? How many job applications are likely to be required in a given week? Will it be averaged out? If someone makes twice as many as what is thought to be the norm in one week and none in the next, will that still be acceptable, or will it be assumed that in that one week he or she is not actively seeking work? If the judgment is made that someone has not been actively seeking work over a recent period, will he be required to repay benefit that he may already have received, as opposed to—or perhaps alongside—being deprived of his current benefit entitlement?<br><br>
Those are questions that will enable us more easily to judge exactly what the Minister means by "encouragement" as opposed to what the Opposition would be inclined to describe as "harassment".<br><br>
We need some hard information about what the Government have in mind because one of the things that I most fear is the degree of subjectivity that will exist. The Minister talked about the expertise of the officials in his Department and the Department of Employment and the way that they will be able to judge from their experience whether someone is really actively seeking work.<br><br>
I do not wish to stray on to the territory of the previous amendment, but there are dozens of reports of the experience of the tests of the 1920s, and the way in which subjective decisions and judgments of counter clerks affected whether people were judged to be looking for work or whether they were fit to continue to receive benefit. A thorough study was made by an official of the Department who discussed with expert, experienced officials the judgments that they had made about particular individuals. He then went to some trouble to investigate the circumstances of those individuals, and found, to his alarm and dismay, that there was often little ground for the subjective judgments made about them.<br><br>
You are familiar, Mr. Winterton, as we all are, with the phrase the "deserving and undeserving poor". Apart from the question of how all this will affect the semi-literate, the inadequate, or people who just do not like filing in forms—over which the Minister glided with his usual smoothness, but which will not be smooth for them—one thing will undoubtedly happen. Those who are pleasant and polite, and look acceptable, will not be pressed nearly so hard as those who are awkward or difficult, or let their distress and anger at their circumstances seep through into their behaviour. They are the people about whom subjective judgments will be made.<br><br>
Once again, we are returning to circumstances in which many people who are looking for work, who would like nothing better than to be offered a job, sometimes of almost any kind, and certainly would like nothing better than to be offered a decent job
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 184</span>
with moderate wages and reasonable conditions, will be threatened, judged, and denied benefit—perhaps denied any income at all.<br><br>
The case against the use of the word "actively" is not that the Opposition believe that people should not look for work, or that they should be allowed to lounge about in the lap of luxury, as the Government seem to think the levels of unemployment benefit and income support allow—that shows that none of them has ever tried to live on benefit. The tests, like those in the existing legislation will be applied in a context wholly divorced from the question whether jobs are available or are being offered.<br><br>
That is what will lead to distress. It will lead, correctly, to a profound sense of injustice among those who are hounded, without any job offer being made to them. That is the problem with the Bill, and it is why we believe that the Government should accept the removal of the word "actively" from the clause. It is unnecessary and will lead to harassment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister to respond, I again make a plea to Committee Members, in presenting their case, not to embellish it by repeating what has been said in earlier debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall take care to abide by your guidance, Mr. Winterton. The final comments of the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) were interesting. She said the Opposition were not opposed to unemployed people having to seek employment. They did not think that they should be able to adopt a merely passive approach, but should get out and seek work.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) was frank enough to acknowledge that in all our constituencies we know of people who do not do that. Some people, for reasons which are not always their own fault—perhaps because of weariness, disappointment or experience of rejection—have been encouraged into an attitude where they give up seeking work and others perhaps because they are inclined that way, do not seek work. We know that there are such people.<br><br>
I would encourage those who doubt the need for this provision to read the Second Reading speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. Shephard). It describes an incident in her constituency which showed how widespread those attitudes can be.<br><br>
Currently, claimants are required simply to be available for work. They are questioned from time to time to see if they are genuinely available for work but, as I said earlier, that is a passive state. Existing legislation does not ensure that unemployed claimants should seek jobs. I do not want to return to the commissioner's findings and subsequent findings which altered that state of affairs. Hon. Members who assume that the existing law requires people to be out there seeking work are mistaken and by including the word "actively" in the clause we are changing that state of play.<br><br>
To show that he or she is actively seeking work, a claimant must be able to show to our offices that he
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0125">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 185</span>
or she has taken steps appropriate to his own skills, experience and background, and the local employment market. If the hon. Lady wants me to give examples of what a claimant ought to do, it would be to register with agencies as well as with the Department of Employment, to contact employers, read advertisements in newspapers and journals and apply for suitable jobs which are advertised. The claimant will have to decide what steps to take. The employment service will discuss periodically with him whether those are the most appropriate steps to get him back into work. It will give guidance and advice so that his job search may be more efficient and active.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) asked how often a person should be expected to do that. We say every week; that is not unreasonable. However, if for example the unemployed person goes for an interview and says, "I have applied for five weeks and for one week I did not", the guidance that he would receive would be "You are supposed to do that every week. You have a good record of applying for jobs but don't give up. If this last week you have shrugged your shoulders and decided not to bother to apply any more, you will put your benefit at risk". Any reasonable interpretation of actively seeking work would satisfy the conditions. The aim is to help and not to hound people into work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister offer the advice not to give up to a 59-year-old ex-miner living in an area where no mine is open within a radius of 60 miles, where there are 3,000 unemployed and fewer than 300 vacancies? Would he say to that person, who felt rejection and humiliation regularly, that he should not give up but should continue to apply?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would depend on the 300 vacancies and whether any might be suitable for the example put forward by the hon. Gentleman. It could be that with his skills and experience that person might widen his horizon. As long as he tried, he would satisfy the conditions. Obviously, in due course there will be regulations and we shall have an opportunity to discuss them.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derby, South asked whether the chief adjudication officer's guide books—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has said that if someone has shown that week after week he has made an effort to seek work but a week has gone by for which evidence of such effort could not be produced—or something to that effect—he may be warned. My understanding of the Bill is that that is not so, that there is no entitlement to benefit if there is not an active search each and every week. The Minister said that the adviser will say, "You must be more careful if you did not do anything that week". That is wrong and would be a breach of the Minister's proposals.</span></p>
<p>12.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Someone who was not taking appropriate steps, or indeed taking no steps, would be told when he came to the office that he was in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 186</span>
danger of losing his benefit. He might well be warned more than once before benefit was withdrawn, but that would happen only when people simply declined to take steps to seek employment.<br><br>
Of course the chief adjudication officer will issue guidance as to how the matter is to be interpreted. The employment service staff, who are not employed by my Department, are qualified to judge whether a claimant is making adequate efforts to find work. Where it seems appropriate, the steps that are being taken will be discussed in a reasonable and fair way with the claimant. If there is any doubt, the independent adjudication officer will take account of the guidance that I have already mentioned and which will be issued by the chief adjudication officer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The figures for 1987 show that 171,515 people were referred as restricting their availability for work by the employment staff that the Minister says are so wise and so qualified to make judgments. Only 85,000, about half of them, were disallowed, and that is a worrying level of error. Referrals for doubt about availability took place only half the cases.<br><br>
The change in the notes on clauses that the Minister circulated to us seems to suggest that it is proposed to go back on the change that was made that people should not lose their money until their cases had been referred to an adjudication officer. Will the Minister give us some assurances on this? It seems that staff are referring wrongly. From the change to the notes on clauses it seems that people may be deprived of their benefit when the first doubt is cast, and not when the case has been to an adjudicating officer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The fact that in such a percentage of cases a different view was eventually taken should reassure the Committee and claimants that the adjudication process operated fairly and genuinely and that there was no rubber-stamping of the original decision. I should have thought that that would be encouraging to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister uncharacteristically missed the point of the intervention by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). Perhaps he deliberately missed it. She is not talking about the reassurance of knowing that incorrect decisions were overturned. She is casting doubt on the reassurance that he offered us about the wisdom and the expertise of the officials and the wonderful way in which they will administer the test.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The interaction between the staff working on benefit and the adjudication system is seen to operate fairly and clearly. That is the point that I seek to make to the Committee. The other matter raised by the hon. Lady will arise on a specific amendment and no doubt you would wish me to discuss that at the appropriate time, Mr. Winterton.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely one of the great advantages of putting the word "actively" in the Bill is that the judgments that now have to be made are those of officers looking at the stated
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0126">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 187</span>
intention of someone to take a particular type of work. When there is no record of whether they are applying for jobs that is a difficult judgment to make. If a record were kept of applications for work, presumably the number of cases that had to go to adjudication or of people being disallowed would be reduced enormously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It would certainly be common sense, assuming that Parliament approves the provision, for claimants to keep a record of the steps that they are taking and to produce that record at the office where they are interviewed.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) asked what would happen in areas of high unemployment. The new responsibility that will be imposed on claimants by the clause will apply everywhere, but in simple terms it means looking for vacancies for which one could apply. As I have said, unemployment is falling and we all want to see it fall still further.<br><br>
New opportunities for employment are being created all the time. I accept that it will be more difficult in some areas than in others to find employment, but the flexibility inherent in the provision that people should be expected to take all appropriate steps means that those who make the judgments, either initially or in the adjudication process, will be able to take account of the local employment situation. However, people will still be expected to continue to seek jobs and not simply to sit back and accept the situation as hopeless. I do not think that that will force people on to a hopeless treadmill of seeking unavailable work or unnecessarily pestering employers. Experience shows that perseverance, especially if it is guided, by the advice and counselling of the employment service, can often lead to a job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Given what the Minister says about employers not being pestered unnecessarily, will he give an undertaking to impose a duty on them to respond to every job application? Unemployed people often write many letters to which they do not receive replies. That is a real part of the disheartening process.<br><br>
Now that the law will require people to prove that they are seeking work, and given that the Minister thinks that this will not be a burden on employers, will he give an undertaking to consider imposing on employers a duty to respond to every job application?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not be drawn down that route. The imposition of such a duty would be an unnecessary burden on employers. The fact that a person has made written application and kept a record of it will be evidence that he can show if his claim to benefit is questioned. To insist that every letter of application had to have a response would put an undue burden on employers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister mean that his Department would not check with an employer whether an application or a letter seeking work had
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 188</span>
been sent? It seems that all the burdens are being placed on the unemployed to prove that they are seeking work and no equivalent requirement is being placed on employers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the employment service would wish to follow up a percentage of cases to see whether the applications that were claimed had been made. Not every case would be checked by the employment service with every employer to see whether an application had been made. That would be a bureaucratic nightmare and a great burden on employers, even on those genuinely anxious to help.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand that, but surely we are in danger of getting into a minefiled. Let us suppose that at interview a claimant says that he has written 10 job applications over the previous six months and has had replies to two, which I suppose would be the average. An investigating officer then contacts those 10 employers and asks whether the claimant has applied for these jobs or written to seek work. If the employer has not kept a record, and small employers often do not; they simply put applications in the bin, surely there will be some doubt in the investigating officer's mind about the truthfulness of the claimant.<br><br>
The Minister should at least be prepared to advise employers even if he is not prepared to go down the road of regulations. He should tell employers that they should normally respond to all job applications. The Minister must be aware that it is dispiriting for the long-term unemployed to write hundreds of letters and not even receive an acknowledgement. People begin to think, "Who the hell cares about me?"</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman in what he says. I understand the dispiriting nature of that experience and agree that it would be good practice for employers to respond to job applications. However, I was asked whether I would place a legal duty on them to do so. That would not be right, but I shall encourage employers with whom I am in contact to respond in as helpful a way as possible to job applications</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister ask his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment to give such advice to employers and to encourage the CBI to do so? The problem does not always arise in big companies because they tend to be better administered, but medium to small employers often feel that this is a bit of a burden and do not respond properly. I am more worried about them than the big employers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall draw my right hon. Friend's attention to what the hon. Gentleman says. Any employer conscious of his own interests should respond, especially since employment is becoming increasingly tight. He may not be able to offer a vacancy to an unemployed person immediately, but may want to retain a record of future availability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will know that the philosophy of job clubs is that everyone should

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 189</span>
pursue 10 leads a day to try to get a job. He may wish to comment on the figures from a study of 20 job clubs carried out on behalf of the Government between April 1987 and February 1988. The study found that for 8,921 advertised vacancies there were 14,290 telephone inquiries, 50,081 letters, and 1,432 speculative visits. That resulted in 476 jobs and 150 positive outcomes. That is the degree of intense activity that is required to obtain a job and the Bill will escalate that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is it correct to say that those statistics were quoted earlier by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray)?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They were not the same statistics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that they were. May I ask the Committee not to repeat evidence that was given earlier in the debate?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. Some figures were quoted of job club applications and the number of applications that people made before they received a reply. The figures from the study that I have mentioned were not quoted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan referred to those figures. I am attending carefully to everything that is said and I request again that we do not go over ground that has been covered unless there is a good reason for doing so and it is directly related to the amendment that we are debating.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. My hon. Friends and I will try not to repeat ourselves, because that is not our desire. We want to debate matters adequately. Will you bear in mind that your request not to quote evidence that has already been used might be unduly restrictive because there are other amendments to which the same piece of evidence may be relevant? While you do not wish us to go over the same ground, you would not wish to restrict us unduly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chair and Members of the Committee have had their say and we should now be clear on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A great deal of energy is generated by membership of job clubs. Because activity in the clubs is pursued with guidance, imagination and perseverance, 54 per cent. of people who enter job clubs find work. That is a good and desirable result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Flynn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept the simple truth that job applications do not create jobs? At any one time there is a fixed number of vacancies and if everyone in job clubs has 10 leads a day, there will be diminishing returns. The blizzard of applications will increase for two reasons. First, because more people will apply for a static number of jobs, and secondly, because of diminishing returns. If the Minister carries this out there will be millions of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 190</span>
speculative phone calls, letters and visits to firms, which will irritate the firms, without affecting the number of available vacancies.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: New jobs are being created all the time. Employment is becoming increasingly tight. There is repeated evidence that employers advertising vacancies receive very few applications from unemployed people. Job clubs are a way to encourage unemployed people to apply for jobs, and they achieve a remarkable success.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Favell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Statistics show that fewer than half of new jobs come through the job centres. Most jobs come through people applying cold—by writing or telephoning, or through a friend, a relative or a member of the same trade union. If people do not go to job clubs and do not apply, they will not have the chance of getting more than half the available jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. The more avenues that are explored in pursuit of employment, the more likely people are to achieve success.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has been patient. I thank him for that, but would try his patience a bit further. Is not one problem that employers do not have to notify vacancies to the job centre, so job seekers are encouraged to join job clubs, write speculative letters, and so on? I do not say that it is not a good idea occasionally to write speculative letters, because that might lead to a skill that had not been thought of, but it would be far more efficient if all vacancies had to be notified to the job centre. All that happens at present is the encouragement of private enterprise job agencies, of varying degrees of efficiency and success.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may have an ideological objection to private job agencies, but my view is that the more expertise in and ways of providing access to employment, the better. There are many specialist agencies—for example, those that build up expertise in finding jobs for nurses or computer programmers. A job centre would not have the expertise to compete with that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Wray</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I find it contradictory that the White Paper, Employment for the 1990s, acknowledges that most benefit claimants are keen to work. A Manpower Services Commission survey of nearly 1,700 claimants found that most of them were looking for jobs and only 8 per cent. were not seeking employment, due to health reasons, yet we discontinued benefit for 53,000 in 1985 and for 101,774 in 1987, more than double. It seems that most people are looking for employment and yet the figures for discontinued benefit have doubled since 1985.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot follow all the statistics that the hon. Gentleman has bombarded me with. The figures from the London labour market quoted by my right
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0128">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 191</span>
hon. Friend the Secretary of State on Second Reading showed that a number of people are not actively seeking work and have taken no steps to seek work in the recent past. Members should refresh their memories by reading the Second Reading speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mrs. Shephard). She gave an example, and clearly there were jobs there but few people applied or bothered to turn up for an interview.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) mentioned hardship payments. We envisage that if someone has been disqualified from benefit and there is hardship, income support can be paid as supplementary benefit, whereas previously, if people were likely to suffer hardship, applications for that benefit could be made to any DHSS office.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Derby, South mentioned the pregnant woman offered a YTS place. Clearly, I am concerned that as many 16 and 17-year-olds as possible should have a proper opportunity on the youth training scheme. That must be good for them—it must be good for the economy of the country, which will soon run into shortages of skills. I cannot comment on the case raised by the hon. Lady, but benefit has already been paid to a number of young, pregnant girls under the severe hardship provisions.<br><br>
For the reasons that I set out broadly in response to the previous amendment, I believe that we are right to move from the passive state of mere availability to one of actively seeking work. I shall not weary the Committee. I am aware of your ruling, Mr. Winterton, to prevent me from so doing. But, I passionately believe that this is the right course to follow in the interests of our country and of the unemployed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened with great care to the Minister, but remain wholly unpersuaded that it is either necessary or desirable for the Government to take this step.<br><br>
The Minister spoke about the success rate of job clubs and, in so far as people are offered jobs, we welcome that. It was said that of those who participated in one survey 54 per cent. of applicants for jobs found them—although at enormous cost. Perhaps I may draw the Minister's attention to a different survey on long-term unemployment in the labour markets. It showed that 40 per cent. of the long-term unemployed who got jobs had made five or fewer applications in the period under study. Although it was felt that frequent job applications might improve the odds, most who made large numbers of applications still ended up without a job. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) said so admirably and succinctly, job applications do not create jobs.<br><br>
The Minister went through the appropriate steps that someone might have to take: registering in agencies, contacting employers, making job applications on a speculative basis, reading papers, and so on. Those are all things that people already do. Those are things that jobs clubs encourage them to do. There is no evidence that there is any need to change the law. In fact, the evidence is to the contrary.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 192</span>
The Minister referred to someone who claimed that he had written to a company to apply for a job. It may have been a slip of the tongue on his part and I should be grateful if he would confirm it, but he appeared to say that the person had been keeping a record of his letters. Having been stuck once during the recess without the photocopying facilities of this place, I can tell the Minister that keeping a record of the letters that one sends costs 5p or 10p per sheet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Scott</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am simply suggesting that he keeps a log of the letters, not a copy of each one. Of course, in Victorian days people wrote out in longhand copies of very long letters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would certainly fill the time of the unemployed. I am surprised that the Minister does not write it into the legislation, because it is plain that the Government are trying to fill in the time of the unemployed because the Government cannot offer them jobs. I am grateful that the Minister has clarified that what he meant was that someone should keep a log of letters sent. Not that that will be of much help when there are no jobs, but at least it is not the point that I thought that the Minister was making.<br><br>
It is interesting that, although he quoted from a number of references in the labour market survey, and so on, the Minister did not draw our attention to the findings in one of the most recent surveys, as unemployment has indeed more recently been falling: the fall in active claimants between spring 1986 and 1987. What the survey shows is particularly relevant to the amendment. A number of claimants were inactive, in the way that the Secretary of State described so contemptuously, but were not looking for work because they were under the impression, no doubt quite correctly, that there were no jobs available. When those unemployed people heard reports on the news—exaggerated by the Government, we argue—that the number of jobs was increasing and job opportunities were available, of their own volition—perhaps some were encouraged by restart—they began again to look for work. They were not inactive because they are workshy, are idle or perfer to live on benefit, but because they knew that there was no work and they thought that it was a complete waste of time to be running round in circles looking for non-existent work. Later on the survey shows—this again is a figure to which the Secretary of State drew attention—a fall among those available for work in the last four weeks but not in the last week, again because people had believed that there were no jobs available.<br><br>
What I thought was so terrible about what the Minister said in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West was this. My hon. Friend drew attention to the possible case of a 59-year-old miner for whom there is no realistic prospect of work. We all know that there is no realistic prospect of work for that man, whether it is down the mines or not, in an area where there are 3,000 unemployed. My hon. Friend asked the Minister whether that man would really be required to go on demonstrating all this evidence of job search week after week, although we all know that there will not be a job for him even
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0129">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 193</span>
if he goes on doing it till doomsday. The Minister's answer, bluntly, was yes. That is much too blunt for the Minister. He wrapped it up in a lot of nice words and said "As long as he is trying, that is the main thing."—as if we were doing the man a favour—"As long as he is trying to look for work, we will go on paying him benefit if he is drawing benefit, or if he is only signing on to maintain his pension credits, we shall allow him to keep the right to his pension credits as long as he is trying." It bears no relationship to whether it is a complete waste of time.<br><br>
How can Ministers and Conservative Members think that it is unimportant, that it will not be resented, that it will not cause distress? The Minister said that he does not believe that we are forcing the unemployed on to a hopeless treadmill or forcing them to pester employers. I do not see how he can say that he does not believe that that is what the Government are doing. It is the essence of what the Government are doing. When one identifies that it does not matter whether there is any work for a person, but what matters is whether he has gone through the right hoops this week, one is, par excellence, telling people to do the equivalent of what my hon. Friend described from the 1920s—one lot walk over the hill one way and another lot walk over the hill in the opposite way. They all know that they are wasting their time, but it makes all those who are not unemployed feel a lot better.<br><br>
The effect of forcing people who are unemployed, people who would like work but who know that there is no work because they have kept trying to get work, to go on making efforts that they know are fruitless and to produce evidence of those efforts week in and week out will be psychologically catastrophic. People who are unemployed are not different from Conservative Members or Labour Members or hon. Members of any other political party or indeed from the majority of the population. They fear unemployment. They do not expect, mostly, to be unemployed themselves, unless they are in a vulnerable industry or a vulnerable area, but even then they hope that it will not hit them.<br><br>
Most people who become unemployed have that sneaking feeling. They share that public opinion referred to so often by Conservative Members: "People who are on the dole—it's their own fault really, isn't it? They must be doing something wrong, because they could find work. Everybody keeps saying there are all these jobs, if only they were looking for them." They think that as well, so when they go looking for work and do not find it because there is no work, they blame themselves. Does the Minister not understand that? They share these ridiculous delusions that it is all the fault of the unemployed, even though there are few vacancies and few jobs. They blame themselves. They think it must be them. They feel their self-confidence evaporating. The Minister says that of course the Government want to encourage them.<br><br>
Why do the Government not open more and better job centres? Why do they not put resources into areas that will help to create work? Why do they not invest in the infrastructure of the economy? The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 194</span>
Government could do a whole range of things if they want to encourage people into work that will actually exist. The Government are not saying that. They are telling people that they will force them to go through this mechanical—the Minister has found the perfect word for it—treadmill. They will say, "We will force you to jump through these hoops, and go on this treadmill week after week, even though we know there is no point."<br><br>
12.45 pm<br><br>
That is what people will find utterly demoralising and unjust. They already resent their unemployment. It hurts their pride, and they think that perhaps the Government are right. The thrust of the legislation is to say that it is the fault of the unemployed, more than has ever been said before. It suggests that they are guilty until they prove themselves innocent, and that if they would look more actively for work it would all be perfectly all right. The Government are loading the burden of guilt on to the individual who is unemployed, even when the course of action they are being told to pursue is pointless.<br><br>
I shall advise my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment. I know that we shall lose, but I wonder why the Government seem incapable of understanding the degree of distress they will cause to many unemployed people and their families. I speak from experience, and I believe that it will be an absolute nightmare. The Government are introducing this measure in order to satisfy prejudice, and for no better reason.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I apologise for not being here for the Division. I was

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 195</span>
on the telephone to my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), who sends his apologies to the Committee. He has a good reason for not being here. Unfortunately I did not hear that a Division had been called, although I was only in a telephone booth across the corridor.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear the point of order. I am permitted to allow up to two minutes for hon. Members to return to the Committee Room. The attendant shouted loudly that there was a Division in the Committee Room. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman did not hear the call, but at the end of two minutes I asked for the doors to be locked, and the Division took place. I hope that in future the hon. Gentleman will leave the door of the telephone kiosk open, so that he may hear what is going on in the Commitee. I am afraid that what he does outside the Committee Room is of no interest to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are probing the way in which the new formulation of the law will affect those who, though unwillingly unemployed, are seeking to turn their period of unemployment to some benefit by engaging in some form of education or training, or by taking part in voluntary work. It is far from clear how easy it will be for people to reconcile those activities with the test as it stands.<br><br>
Two slightly different issues arise in connection with education and training. I believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) thinks that the existing provisions are inadequate and wishes to probe the question of whether there is scope for them to be widened.<br><br>
We hope that the effect of amendment No. 41 would be that, if an unemployed person was following a course of study or training, that would be accepted as an alternative to the requirement actively to seek employment. We do not intend the amendments to alter—and we believe that they do not—the overriding requirement that in order to qualify for benefit someone must be available for employment. For example, full-time students cannot claim unemployment benefit but, if the availability condition can be satisfied it can be claimed by those on part-time courses, because they are willing to give up the course if a suitable job becomes available or, as is sometimes possible, to study outside working hours.<br><br>
Provided that a claimant can satisfy the adjudication officer that he is available for employment should it be offered—we come again to the question of whether employment is actually rather than theoretically offered—even on the days when he is studying, his entitlement is accepted. Clear criteria are set out in the adjudication officers' guide which shows how such a judgment might be made.<br><br>
Even if a claimant has become so involved in a course or, in a long period of unemployment, has gone on from one course to another, and was reluctant to give up that course, he might still qualify for benefit because, on the days when he was not on the course he would remain available for work. Unemployment benefit is, in a sense, a daily benefit.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 196</span>
The effect of the test of actively seeking employment on these arrangements is far from clear. It has implications for those who are unemployed and cannot find work as it questions whether they will be able to put their time to some beneficial use which, in the long term, will be of more assistance to them in finding their way back into employment. There is also the question of whether the carrying out of the test will impede their studies or their voluntary work.<br><br>
At best, there may be a considerable period of uncertainty while the case law is clarified. It would be helpful to have some guidance set out as clearly as possible. Apart from the claimants and the way they may be able to pursue their studies, there is a large area of unemployment in further education colleges. Many unemployed people are trying to improve their employment chances by pursuing such courses, and those who teach them are obviously in either full-time or part-time employment. If this process is about to come to a grinding halt because of the test, not only will the unemployed be affected but those at present employed who will cease to be so. So, it is a matter of considerable concern and uncertainty which we seek to remove by amendments Nos. 41 and 46.<br><br>
Amendment No. 50 draws attention to the issue raised in passing by my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood in a previous debate as to whether people will still be allowed to continue what may be very useful voluntary work. It may be useful not only to the community for whom the voluntary work is carried out but to the individual, particularly the young who may not have had many employment opportunities and for whom it may be the nearest they may be able to get to acquiring an opportunity to work in an office and gain experience.<br><br>
As late as the end of October last year, the Under-Secretary of State for Employment gave an assurance to the citizens advice bureaux which have a large number of volunteers that, as long as a person was able to be readily contacted and could obtain release on 24 hours' notice, there was no problem about his availability for work. Again it is far from clear, particularly as so much of the test is being left to regulations, how the provision will apply to those in these circumstances.<br><br>
The citizens advice bureaux in particular drew attention to the fact that they believe that they play an important role in retraining and rehabilitating the unemployed. The Minister spoke at some length in previous debates about the Government's wish to encourage the unemployed and to improve their chances of obtaining work, yet it is exactly this kind of experience which often encourages people and gives them a better chance of finding work. They may obtain a placement for a relatively short period, but one third of selected and trained volunteers leave bureaux within a year and find paid employment. Therefore, it is a valuable source of experience and training.<br><br>
It also causes concern because citizens advice bureaux have a duty roster and a good proper training programme for volunteers, which is valuable to claimants and forms an important part of their own
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0131">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 197</span>
work. Again, therefore, it is a matter of some anxiety as to how the provisions of the Bill will affect them.<br><br>
When the Government talk about active citizenship, I can think of no better definition than the sort of participarion in voluntary work which has, up to now, been permissible for the unemployed as long as it did not impede their availability for work. It is a matter of great concern outside the Committee as to how the legislation will be brought to bear on them.<br><br>
I should be grateful if the Minister would at least consider the amendments and tell us what he thinks the position will be.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Short</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an enormously important subject and I rise in the few minutes before One o'clock because of its importance and to put some points to the Minister before he replies.<br><br>
There is a concession that those who are unemployed can study for up to 21 hours a week if they remain available for work. It is not sufficiently publicised but it has been an enormously important
