</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Welcome, Mr. McWilliam. I hope that you enjoy this afternoon's performance as we move into Act II. When we adjourned we were talking about the problems of the acting profession and the way that it is undervalued. The wealth and success of individuals is exaggerated, although I sincerely hope that the importance of the culture is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned that a number of actors and actresses, although quite famous, go through quite long periods of unemployment and are prepared to be fairly versatile in their work. Before Ben Kingsley played Gandhi he was out of work for a long time despite being a very talented actor. Paul Eddington, who should endear himself to all hon. Members for his role in "Yes, Minister", is also prepared to do many other jobs such as voiceovers. I last met him on Christmas day when he was touring the Whittington hospital in my constituency. He is the chairman of the Friends of Whittington hospital and was helping to raise money for a new baby clinic. That is the sort of character we are dealing with. He probably represents what is best in the acting profession and what it is trying to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On an earlier clause the Minister said that he had some sympathy with the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) about the difficulties faced by actors. I should like to add a couple of points to what my hon. Friend said then and what I said this morning. Unless this country starts to take the problems of the acting profession and of individual actors seriously our cultural heritage of west end theatre, local theatre and films will suffer badly. We need a social security regime that recognises the difficulties that actors face.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>502</span>
Let us consider the impact of west end theatre on the tourist industry and the commercial life of London as a whole. A major attraction for tourists in London is the chance to go to west end theatres. Any part of the country that is trying to boost its tourist image usually starts on the basis that it has good theatres, and in some cases good cinemas. Live theatre and live acting are particularly important. Actors are not particularly well paid and they do not enjoy continuous employment. But there is something that we can do here. If the Minister accepts the amendment or something like it in spirit it will make life slightly easier for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we did not have good live theatre and theatre schools in this country the export of British drama to the United States, the Soviet Union, Africa, India or wherever would be reduced. There would be no basis for the theatre in the first place. Secondly, the film industry develops from theatre. I deeply regret that so much of what was achieved in the British film industry before and after the war has been lost with the demise of a number of studios. But the British film industry has experienced a considerable revival. It is going fairly well and has a number of extremely successful productions, successful both in terms of entertainment and the values they advance and as exports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we are to have a successful film industry it must be based on successful theatre and a secure acting profession. We are not asking for special payments to actors as happens in some countries. Many people who worked in recent British films and series such as "Jewel in the Crown" and "Gandhi" learnt their craft and developed their career in west-end theatres. They will look for a provision in the Bill that recognises the insecurity of acting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that everything should be done by charity—I do not believe that the Health Service or housing should be run by charity, because health care and housing are rights. However, we must recognise that charities have a role in identifying demand and need and sometimes, in meeting unmet needs. A greater proportion of actors and actresses do charity work than any other profession. That is partly because actors and actresses are household names, and in some cases like to be so well known. Every Member of Parliament in this Room would love to be a household name. Unfortunately, none of us is, or is likely to be. Politicians are not that different from actors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I saw an advertisement on the tube last night, asking people to join the Metropolitan police. It said that the police looked at the body language of people whose job required them to be economical with the truth, such as actors and politicians. I thought that that was a monstrous attack on actors, but I do not know about politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The acting profession is hard up and badly paid and it is a risky and precarious occupation. I hope that people entering the profession do so with their eyes open about the chances of success. For a few people, there is dazzling success, wealth and a good standard of living. For the majority, there is nothing of the sort. The majority are lucky if they are able to work six months of the year, and are very lucky if
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0302">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>503</span>
they can work nine months of the year. Most of them spend much of their time being unemployed. We want the Bill to recognise the precarious nature of that employment and the fact that it takes actors and actresses longer to find suitable work than other people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first address the point made by the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) and raised earlier in a different context by the hon. member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, I am sympathetic to this case. I, too, want to see a thriving theatre and a renewed and vigorous film industry in Britain. As my hon. Friend said, Equity and the Department of Employment are discussing whether special recognition can be given to acting, but I share my hon. Friend's pessimism about the possibility of defining the chartacteristics which make the acting profession different. The hon. Member for Islington, North rightly outlined those differences, which include uncertainty about the duration of employment and gaps between employment. The problem is to define those characteristics in such a way as to narrow any arrangement that might be made for the acting profession. Talks are proceeding. Neither my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary nor I is without sympathy for the case, but we are both pessimistic about the likely outcome. We shall keep in close touch with our colleagues in the Department of Employment about the matter. I am grateful for the way in which the hon. Gentleman put the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understsand that the Minister may think it impossible to confine such definitions to the acting profession, but if other people are in similar circumstances and might be similarly disadvantaged by the Bill—and I cannot think of any—surely they, too, should be protected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going on to say that sympathetic as we are, although pessimistic about the outcome, I find it difficult to understnad why every actor should be precluded, however lengthy the intervals, from a requirement at some point to find other employment. They might seek the sort of employment that would make them better able to get back into the acting profession as soon as possible. We shall not resolve these questions today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It should be placed on the record that the Minister has asked why the acting profession should not be required to look for work. We return to the question whether the present law needs to be stiffened up and we suggest that the present law meets the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matters have been fully discussed and will no doubt be discussed later. I have mentioned both our sympathy and our pessimism and I do not think that we shall proceed further today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 99, 105 and 68 all bear on the time which should be available to unemployment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>504</span>
benefit claimants to restrict their job search, if they wish to work in their usual occupation and at their usual level of pay. All three would take a more relaxed view of that requirement than we think appropriate because we want to encourage people after a certain periods to widen their horizons and look for other kinds of employment if they are to continue to receive benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment 99, which is the most ambitious of the amendments, seeks to put no limit of any kind on the period during which an unemployed person can continue, without any effect on his benefit title, to search for a job in the occupation that he has been used to and at a wage that he has been accustomed to. It ignores the fact that such a job may no longer be available in the area in which he lives. It does not provide any incentive for the claimant to broaden his job search and adopt a flexible approach to the job vacancies which are available. It would allow the claimant to remain on benefit rather than try to become self-supporting by branching out along an unfamiliar track. It would enable people to refuse all offers of work unless they matched their former occupation, irrespective of the length of time that they have been out of work and the extent to which their skills and experience remain relevant. This amendment would allow the claimant to hold out for a job which he had no longer any realistic prospect of obtaining at a time of change in the labour market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's comments astounding. Will not the restrictions of the availability condition and the actively seeking employment test still stand? It is not the case that there are no limits. There is no need for the time restriction because the belt and braces are already in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The qualification is simply to remain available for work, and the thrust of the argument that we have had over and over again is that the passive state of availability should not be sufficient to satisfy the requirements. We are retreading familiar ground. I do not believe that the position that I have just described can possibly be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing legislation allows benefit claimants a "reasonable interval" in which to look for their own type of work, but thereafter they are expected to look beyond those horizons. The guidance given under existing law to adjudication officers is that about three months on benefit is the longest period which it is reasonable to allow without expecting the claimant to recognise the need to extend his job search. In the immediate aftermath of losing his job, for whatever reason, it seems reasonable to enable him to restrict his horizons in terms of both salary and type of job to that to which he has been accustomed. After that, people should not be unduly trammelled by their experience in employment if it becomes clear that they will not be able speedily to return to that sort of job. That is becoming particularly true in a society in which jobs come and go and in which the economy is growing and speeding up all the time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>505</span>
In the regulations that will result from the clause, we propose to establish a position very similar to that which exists already under case law. In the present situation where old types of work are disappearing and new ones are coming on stream, it would be unfair to claimants who are prepared to be flexible and look for new opportunities, to give others an unlimited time to insist on their former type of work and level of pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 68 and 105 are not so wide-ranging or ambitious as amendment No. 99. Amendment No. 68 would, however, mean that there was no power to set out in regulations the longest "permitted period". Amendment No. 105 would mean that everyone, no matter what his experience or the state of the labour market, could draw benefit for at least six months if he could not find work in his usual occupation at his usual pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A I have said, when we design the regulations, our intention is to fix the maximum length of the "permitted period" at 13 weeks, and in effect establish in regulations what tends to happen in practice now. Briefly, the effect of current legislation is that whereas at first an unemployed person will not be disqualified for receiving unemployment benefit if he refuses to accept work other than employment in his usual occupation at the rate of pay that he is used to, after the lapse of a "reasonable interval", employment will not be unsuitable for him simply because it is not in his usual occupation. There are other conditions attached, but the basic message is that after that "reasonable interval" an unemployed person is expected to broaden his horizons and that will be made clear in regulations under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measures are designed not to penalise the unemployed but to encourage them to be more realistic about their labour market potential. In those circumstances I think that we are right and the amendments are wrong because, as I said, in their very different ways they would take a much more relaxed attitude towards encouraging and persuading people to seek other job opportunities at levels of pay that they have not been used to, on which to support themselves and their families and provide for their old age.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will not be cajoled by the encouraging marketing language of "persuading" and "encouraging". If our amendments are not accepted, the clause will put a coercive condition into the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that the 13-week period will be put into the regulations; we know where we stand on that. But I am somewhat at sea about the arbitrary way in which the Minister appeals to case law in some circumstances and in other circumstances says that because case law is going in a particular direction, we have to build it into regulations. Why does he claim to hide behind case law in some circumstances and not in others? He goes towards regulations when he wants to build increasing rigidities into the Bill on his terms, and towards case law when things seem to be more difficult for the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present law, which the clause will repeal, makes it clear that after a certain period people will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>506</span>
have to look for employment in different circumstances, but the circumstances that are considered to be reasonable vary. That is precisely why there is case law in the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the amendment would be unfair to people who take jobs in different circumstances, but if the clause remains as it is, it will certainly be unfair to those in special circumstances because they will not be able to plead separate special circumstances, nor will they be able to appeal against the decision that after 13 weeks, no matter what job offer comes up, they will be disqualified from claiming unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The availability condition is already in the Bill. The "actively seeking employment" condition is in the Bill. The Minister does not need this extra, coercive clause tagged on to the Bill to provide an additional condition. He said that the Government expect people to be more realistic about their labour market potential. That phrase will bear long and careful examination by members of the Committee and people outside. We may well return to those words later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the Minister's reply, I urge the Committee to vote for amendment No. 99.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I received a letter recently from a professional musician. I should like to read part of it to the Committee, as it is an example of the sort of cases that we are talking about. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am, by occupation, a professional composer and musician— I have had considerable success in the past, although since being released from a major recording contract in 1982, have not, since, had such good fortune. From 1982 until 1986, I was sponsored by relatives and survived on my savings, until the money eventually ran out. In my 18 year musical career, I have been a burden on the welfare state for only about 18 months."</p></blockquote>
Although the writer has a baby son born 15 months ago, because of his desire to maintain his musical career, he has been refused benefit. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This brings me to point 2. The nature of my business, means, in order to become successful, I have to do speculative unpaid work, writing and recording songs etc, in order to secure a new recording contract. Because of this, I was informed by the D.H.S.S., that I may not be entitled to benefit at all as I was technically 'unavailable for work'. How extremely convenient for them! Yet another way to avoid paying out. I thought that Mrs. Thatcher was of the opinion, that 'charity begins at home' and that we should help ourselves and our families, wherever possible, rather than being dependent on the state. I, in fact, have been penalised for doing all of those things!</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>When I am finally successful, in the music business, I will have to pay a damn sight more in tax than the welfare state has paid to me in benefits—of course when that time is upon me, I will emigrate.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I raise these issues because, in a few months time, we will hear that smug voice of the conservative government, bleating on about how they've miraculously cut the unemployment rate—the figures will actually be a false reflection of the reality, as many will still be 'under the carpet', where they were neatly brushed, fighting for survival.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The strain this has put on my family, is heightened further by the difficulty we have in obtaining an alternative benefit—we, conveniently, don't appear to fit into any of the government's carefully designed categories. They have, almost, committed the perfect crime. I do hope you can bring this out into the open, so that they don't get away with it!"</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put two points to the Minister. First, I have been talking in this debate on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0304">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>507</span>
behalf of Equity and acting interests. Actors and actresses who are determined to get another acting job, or a position of some sort in the profession, do not always have a financial motive. Their rates of pay are so low that they would hardly be sticking around just for financial gain. The West End minimum rate is £160 per week, which is very low for any salary, especially for seasonal work. It is less than most bus drivers earn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Actors try to retain their position in the profession which, in itself, strengthens the profession. As a community, we badly undervalue culture, and often undervalue the work of actors and actresses.— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> For the benefit of the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire), the word I used was "culture". It involves history, theatre and art, so the hon. Gentleman may have difficulty in understanding the word. I hope that the Minister recognises that a different motive is involved in the acting profession. He said that people should not hang around for a higher paid job. There is nothing wrong with that as such. I do not disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle). But in respect of the acting position, a different point has to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that talks were going on with Equity and the Department of Employment. I did not fully understand what he meant by that. When we debated clause 8 on 7 February, my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West moved an amendment. In reply, the Under-Secretary of State said that he was prepared to have discussions with Equity about what was proposed in that amendment and what is being proposed in this amendment. It is acceptable that there should be such discussions, but as far as I am aware, they have not yet taken place. Will the Minister confirm that such discussions will take place? He was rather pessimistic about the outcome. It is unfortunate that he should approach the talks on a basis of pessimism on one side. Surely one should approach talks on a basis of optimism on both sides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible to draft regulations which mention prescribed occupations. They are perfectly acceptable in many aspects of employment law, such as work permit law. It is possible to identify them by qualification or by membership of a professional association. It happens in tax schedules and the like. There is no reason why it cannot happend in this instance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would not be doing actors and actresses any favours by accepting our proposal, but would give them the opportunity to continue working in their chosen profession. They would not be forcing them to accept another job, which would take them out of the public eye and away from the notice of others in the profession. Someone who wants to get on in the acting profession must move in acting circles and be seen to practise his or her craft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have had actresses doing part-time jobs for me, and they have gone back into the profession as soon as they can. Part-time work is a help, but not everyone can provide it and not every actor and actress can get it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>508</span>
As a society, we need to recognise that our lives are enriched by the value of our culture and by those who put a great deal into their cultural endeavours, but who get very little out of them. The Bill could easily be amended to make the lives of actors and actresses a little easier. That would do a great deal to strengthen the profession which, as I am sure the Minister recognises, plays a valuable role in all our lives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply briefly. The hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) said that currently there was provision for a judgment to be made about what was reasonable in various circumstances. That will still be possible under the new system, because we shall provide in regulations the power to prescribe both a lower and upper limit for the permitted period. Therefore, it will be possible to make a judgment about the right permitted period for any individual circumstances between the upper and lower limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am confused about this. The Minister is saying that there will be an upper limit, but that no level will be set. I understood that the maximum was 13 weeks, that it will remain at 13 weeks and that there will not be an appeal beyond 13 weeks. Will there be powers to extend that period?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that it will be possible to judge what is most appropriate between the specified lower limit and the upper limit of 13 weeks.

I take up now the question raised by the hon. Member for Islington, North. Department of Employment officials have been in touch with Equity to arrange a meeting. It has not yet taken place, but both side are intent on ensuring that it will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have much sympathy with many of the points raised by the hon. member for Islington, North, but however much one believes in the role of the acting and music professions in contributing to our quality of life, is it the job of the social security system to exempt actors and musicians from provisions that will apply to the rest of humanity, or to give them special privileges? There may be other ways in which that can be done. Perhaps those of us who enjoy going to the theatre and to concerts should pay more, so that special schemes for actors and musicians can exist.

Although an actor may be accomplished, and a member of Equity, he may rest for so long that it becomes clear that he is unlikely to obtain work on the stage again. In those, circumstances, it may be in the interests of the individual concerned—apart from anyone else—to broaden his horizons and think of other work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My experience, which is much more limited than that of the hon. Member for Islington, North, is that many actors are only too anxious to keep themselves busy and to extend their experience of human life, which can enhance their abilities to work on the stage or the screen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all these reasons, I am right to have a guarded feeling about the likely outcome of any talks.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave the brief point that the Minister was making about whether it was right in all circumstances for people in and out of the acting profession to be supported, I reminded the Committee that at least some of those people have a right to unemployment benefit, as they have paid contributions for it. Only where their right to unemployment benefit has been exhausted does the question arise about whether the state should continue, out of charity, to continue to support them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North will press these issues again when we discuss the next amendment. The provision presents a serious issue for those in the acting and music professions. The Minister has the chance to take their case on board, and I am sad that he cannot do so. I am learning that the answer to the riddle, "When is a concession not a concession?". It is when the concession is given in Committee but is not included in regulations or written into the Bill. The regulations will be a stiffer interpretation than the Minister says. A tightening of the conditions for people claiming unemployment benefit is built into the clause, rather than any relaxing or leaving it at the status quo.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 65, in page 6, line 32, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or (c) at a time when he can reasonably expect to find employment in his usual occupation within three months, to seek or accept other employment."</p></blockquote>
I hope that this is act III, final scene. The Minister will have understood everything that has been said thus far. This is a further amendment designed to take notice of the problems of the acting profession. In deference to my hon. friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short), I do not exclude musicians from the acting profession, but include them generally in my remarks. In some cases, it would be more difficult to regulate for them, but that could be dealt with by discussion and negotiation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unemployment in this country is disgracefully high. In some areas, it is 15, 20 or 25 per cent. In the acting profession, unemployment is between 65 and 80 per cent. Many actors do not earn particularly
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>510</span>
good wages. Indeed, 40 per cent. of the members of Equity are on very low earnings; 45 per cent. earn less than £3,000 a year and only 4 per cent. have declared earnings of over £10,000 a year, at which stage 1 per cent. of their salary is levied as a subscription to Equity. That is only 4,000 people earning over £10,000 a year, which is not a high salary compared with many other jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professional entertainers suffer many periods when no suitable parts are available or being offered to them. They may be long-established in the profession and go to many auditions and interviews but only obtain a few short contracts, which do not break their claim for benefit. The extent of their seeking work, their professional histories and the fact that they have had recent employment would lead to a reasonable expectation that more substantial employment in the profession would be found within three months. The efforts that are made to find work are considerable. Actors and actresses do a lot of telephoning to theatres, film and commerical recording studios. Musicians try session work, educational work and so on. They sometimes undertake other employment: for example one often finds theatrical sellers of hot dogs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The bulk of their employment is of short duration, and many short acting jobs last only a few days or weeks. Those are separated by periods of unemployment and it can take many weeks before even established performers obtain a professional contract of sufficient length to break a claim for benefit. The Government should understand the implication of the provision on such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even some of the more lucrative and prestigious contracts in films and television dramas may be too short to break a claim for benefit. Indeed, very few long-term contracts are available. Most recording contracts are very short. More parts are available at certain times than at others, depending on what is being produced. Unlike most other professions, an actor can apply only for parts that suit his physical appearance, voice and experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fluctuation in funding is a major source of problems. When my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West chaired the GLC Arts and Recreation committee, they were halcyon days for arts and culture in London. There had never been such support or recognition of theatre and culture. Unfortunately, since the GLC was abolished, there has been a drop in the number of theatres operating in London, and the commercial pressures on theatres are greater than ever. St. George's theatre in my constituency, which produces mainly Shakespearian plays for schools, is constantly under pressure to have smaller casts. The most versatile actors have to act in three or four different Shakespearian roles with barely time to change in between. It shows great effort on their part, but does not say much for acting as a whole that so many plays are now produced with small casts because of the lack of funding from the public purse caused by the loss of the GLC, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will understand that. During periods of unemployment many actors obtain short-term contracts or fill-in work. In the meantime
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>511</span>
they continually seek further work that will take them off the unemployment register by contacting directors and agents. I hope that the Minister will understand our earlier points about the need to recognise the theatrical and musical industry in this country and the need for the Bill at least to take account of professions such as acting. I recognise that the Bill is not a piece of arts legislation. It cannot determine long-term funding for the arts and it cannot determine pay in the industry, but the restrictive way in which it is drawn up at present will hurt many people in this country, particularly those who are trying to keep an admirable profession going. I am sure that the Minister does not want that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister is prepared to negotiate sensibly with Equity on how mat need can be recognised and how a prescribed employment clause can be inserted in the Bill to provide the protection that we seek for the industry so that actors and actresses will not be forced to give up their acting prospects and take up some other form of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Occasionally actors or actresses decide that they are not going to make it in the profession. I know a number of young actors and actresses and they have discussed it with me. I have told some of them that I do not think that they will achieve anything and that they should try something else. One must understand actors' determination. It is the lot of most actors and actresses to spend much time actively seeking work and that should be recognised. Regulations should be drawn up. I am sure that that is not beyond the wit and ingenuity of those present in the Committee, especially the silent civil servants who do all the thinking. I am sure that they could draft regulations that would achieve what we are putting forward on behalf of Equity. We want to protect this cultural asset and not force actors out of acting into something else and thus deprive them of any chance of public recognition and of returning to their chosen profession at a later date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) seems to suggest that if people who want to do a particular job of a rather esoteric nature where there are few employment prospects fail to achieve that objective they should be supported by their fellow citizens. I should like to extend the logic of that argument. There is another profession where people make strenuous efforts to find a job. They are very determined, they put themselves out a lot, they travel round the country and they write loads of letters. They get interviews, they bow, scrape and plead and offer to change their views. They do all those things to become Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the hon. Gentleman suggest that those people who would love to be Members of Parliament should be supported by their fellow citizens while all that is going on? If there is a good safe seat in our party there will be 300 marvellously good candidates waiting for it. Are they all to be supported on the dole? Most members of the Committee would consider that ridiculous. By extrapolating the hon. Gentleman's argument we see that it has no logic or justification.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

In the crazy cock-eyed world of the market economy so beloved of the hon.

Her great friends the ticket touts would all be put out of business with no theatre tickets to sell. We would be reduced to the cultural level of the Murdoch empire. That is possibly what she wants. It is not what I want and not, I suspect, what other people in this country want. The amendments recognise that those who have worked in the acting profession find it harder to get another job in that profession because of the way the industry works than almost anyone else. I am sure that even the hon. Lady could understand that if she bothered to try.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) will be able to recognise that. She is apparently incapable of recognising the difference between wishing to be and succeeding in becoming a Member of Parliament, which means that for some three or four years one is assured of income until the next general election, and what happens in the acting profession. There is therefore not much that she is capable of recognising.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a fair observation. The hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with the contribution from my hon. Member the Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman). Those of us who wish to become Members of Parliament, irrespective of party, have to be active in our search to get here. Few seats drop into people's laps. Perhaps in the back of her mind was the idea that there should be a permitted period beyond which we had to drop our quest and go elsewhere, which might thin out the ranks and lower the standard in the House rather than enhance it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would gain brownie points by filling in our time with profitable work of one sort or another—perhaps like those in the acting profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the general state of play when people seek to come to this House. I am not sure that I can add much to what I was saying earlier, in response to the hon. Member for Islington, North,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>513</span>
about the circumstances in the acting profession. It is all on the record and we can take account of it in whatever consideration we give to those matters. I have said that some consideration will be given to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, however, does not deal with the specific problems of the acting profession. It would extend the provision right across the board. The permitted period would be extended indefinitely into the future. Claimants could simply provide, or be provided with, opportunity after opportunity to keep hanging on for a job in their own field, drawing benefit without any fear of sanction. That is contrary to the thrust of the clause. Whatever sympathy one may have for those in the artistic profession I could not advise the Committee to accept an amendment that ranges as broadly as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Minister is saying. This is a broad amendment, but I take it that he is prepared to include the proposals of the amendment—and the two earlier amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) and me—in the talks that he will presumably have with the Department of Employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that Equity will be anxious to put forward that case. Even if we were convinced that the hon. Gentleman's proposals would be right for the acting profession—and I am not convinced of that—extending those proposals to the population as a whole would be against the thrust of the clause and the Bill. I know that the hon. Gentleman does not agree with the thrust of the Bill, but he cannot expect the Government to support such an amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's argument, but we are asking for recognition of the particular difficulties of the acting profession. The Minister knows and understands that. People do not stay in the acting profession entirely out of self-interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is partly because they enjoy, love, and want to contribute to the profession, but it is also in the interests of society, and society should recognise that contribution. If the Bill is not amended, it will seriously impede actors and actresses. It will make it difficult for them to remain in the profession unless they have a continuous run of contracts that keep them in work. If not, many more actors and actresses will be forced into even greater poverty than they are in now. Many in the acting profession live in poor circumstances. Some may be forced out of the profession altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being unemployed does not mean that actors or actresses are not capable. Earlier, I mentioned Ben Kingsley and the lengthy period of unemployment that he experienced. He is a very good actor, one of the world's best, but that did not prevent him from being unemployed for a long time. Cast lists from Ealing movies of the mid-1950s show dozens of names. A few of them are still prominent. I saw Larry Hagman in an old American wartime film. He went on to something even worse when he starred in "Dallas". It was downhill all they way for him. Others
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>514</span>
have managed to survive in the profession. It is partly a lottery, but it partly requires recognition by society of the contribution that people in acting and the film industry make in enriching our cultural knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will be prepared to negotiate and consider regulations that will provide that recognition and enable people to continue in that profession, rather than encourage them to leave which will be the Bill's effect if it is unamended. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 101, in page 6, line 33, leave out "may" and insert "shall".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 102, in page 6, line 34, leave out "of a prescribed description".</p>
	<p>No. 66, in page 6, line 34, after "description", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"which shall include any person who has been continuously unemployed for 26 weeks or more".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments deal with new section 20A (2), which gives the Secretary of State the power to prescribe in regulations the categories of people who will be allowed to leave a job after a trial period, without disqualification from benefit. That is one of the few twinkles of light in the Bill and we hope to intensify that illumination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to understand what is intended by the clause. The notes on clauses state:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The powers will also be used to describe … categories of people—such as those who have been out of work for at least 12 months".</p></blockquote>
The words "such as" encourage us and suggest that other categories might be prescribed, not just those who are unemployed for a year or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 102 is designed to draw an explanation from the Minister about his intentions. Amendment No. 101 is designed to ensure that the Secretary of State would be obliged to make use of the powers. Amendment No. 66 recognises more fully the psychology of unemployed people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new section will enable any person under the prescribed description to leave a job after a trial period of six to 12 weeks, without incurring disqualification. However the Government's intention is that that concession should apply only to those who have been unemployed for a year or more, and to other categories that we shall no doubt hear about shortly. Those categories are to be specified in regulations and details are not available now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 66 fixes the qualifying period of unemployment at six months instead of 12. Anyone who has been out of work for that long is likely to be desperate to get back into work of some sort, and may be tempted to take an entirely unsuitable job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state of mind of the unemployed has been well researched and is well understood, but the Government are reintroducing subjective judgments
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>515</span>
about it. People who suffer the trauma of being imprisoned find that the first 14 days are the real blow. After that they reach a plateau, the suffering of imprisonment does not worsen, and they come to terms with it. Unlike prisoners, unemployed people find that the first weeks are ones of some relief. They have broken from the drudgery of years of work and the tyranny of rising at a certain time each day and following a routine. They spend their time doing all the jobs that they did not have time to do around the house. There is a honeymoon period that lasts for a few weeks. A plateau of misery—rather than acceptance—comes later. By six months, the unemployed have reached rock bottom in the resentment that they feel in suffering from the daily insult of unemployment. Six months is the sensible period to choose. There is a great danger that people will, during that time, take unsuitable jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the sentiment behind the Government's thinking, but the risk of taking unsuitable jobs will be greatly increased by the pressures placed on the unemployed through the "actively seeking employment" test and the fact that low earnings will no longer be accepted as a factor to be taken into account when considering job offers. The penalty for taking a junk job with dirt wages and being forced to leave it is no longer only six weeks' disqualification—as it was until 1986—but six months'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a strong case for allowing a trial period during which the penalty does not apply. The Government are deliberately imposing pressure on unemployed people to accept low pay and substandard jobs. People who have been unemployed for between six and 12 months need a safeguard just as much as those who have been unemployed for a year or more. The Minister said that people should be aware of their labour potential and talked of his intention not to punish or penalise the unemployed. It is difficult for the Opposition to accept that, when the intention of the legislation is to force people all the time not to widen their horizon, but to lower their standards, in a phrase that the Minister slipped in when he spoke about actors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We give a cautious word of welcome to the thinking behind the clause. People should not find themselves trapped in jobs that after a short time they experience as an unsuitable drudgery that they cannot continue. They might find that their skills are being underused.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The first Committee on which I served considered a local government Bill and in one of the early debates I hailed her as a star and spoke of the excitement that I felt in the presence of someone who clearly would be a star in politics. Unfortunately, she has certainly become a star, but it has been more of a shooting star than a rising star—and the shooting has perhaps been in one of her nether regions. I propositioned the hon.

He had been through the honeymoon period, had done all the jobs round the house, then he suddenly found that his spouse was shouting at him and that he was becoming a nuisance. He was getting desparate; he had to find something. He applied for a job cleaning toilets at Tredegar house and was rejected. That person and almost anyone else who did that job would feel demeaned. It would be difficult to get a great deal of job satisfaction or to see that the work that one was doing reflected one's talents or abilities.

There are moments in life when people get a great deal of satisfaction from seeing a line of washing. It is a banner of triumph which says that cleanliness has been achieved.

[MR. PATRICK THOMPSON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) on bringing life to the Trappists earlier today. Two Trappists have sprung to life this afternoon—perhaps more will follow. The hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) is positively bubbling, determined to intervene to tell us how the market economy can solve all problems. I advise her to stick to ticket touts, as she seems to be an expert in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 66 seeks to help actors and actresses to do what the Minister said they should be doing anyway—obtaining casual employment between professional contracts. I hope that the Minister understands that actors want to obtain other work without fear of disqualification from benefit when they stop doing that work. If an actor who is between jobs can get temporary, casual, part-time employment sweeping roads, working in a restaurant or library, teaching or whatever, he or she should not be disqualified from benefit because that job ends and he or she starts to search for acting work again. Other jobs must be short-term if actors are to be available for acting parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is not specific to actors but would encourage them to take other work, whereas the clause as drafted imposes a disincentive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All three amendments deal with the concept of the trial period of employment. I am grateful for the Opposition's welcome for the thinking behind that concept. It is a useful concession to have introduced into the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the principle is established, the relevant regulations will define who may be covered by the concession. The definition can then be modified by secondary legislation as we learn about how it will work in practice. However, such a concession could not be entirely done away with, so I am happy to welcome amendment No. 101. The idea of a trial period is useful and relevant and has a long-term future. If we eventually decide that it is no longer relevant, we should have to repeal it by primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not so happy about amendment No. 102, which seeks to extend the definition of people who could take a job on trial and leave it within a specified period if it did not suit them. The groups that we intend to define in regulations would be those who had been sick or unemployed for a long period, those who may be entering employment for the first time, having spent years looking after children or elderly relatives, and those who may be apprehensive about taking up work again. The regulations will try to define those groups as closely as possible, and we hope that the concession will encourage them into employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Enabling anyone to take advantage of the concession, as amendment No. 102 proposes, would result in various situations which would not be appropriate. It would be an abuse of the concession
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>518</span>
to spread it much more widely. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject amendment No. 102.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to be churlish about small mercies, but why is the Minister willing to accept amendment No. 101 when only this morning he was not willing to accept that the Government should make regulations about showing good cause? He said that it would be impossible and wrong to bind future Governments. Surely the principle of replacing "may" with "shall" in regard to the regulations is the same in both amendments. I do not understand why he accepts amendment No. 101, but refused to accept our earlier amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One needs a judicious mixture. What is appropriate for one part of the Bill would not be appropriate for another. I am glad that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) welcomed my comments on amendment No. 101. It might even cheer her up when she hears what I have to say about amendment No. 66. There is merit in ensuring that a person should benefit from our proposals after 26 weeks rather than 52 weeks. The period of 26 weeks has become the time when the restart counsellors first interview people. The advantages of taking up employment on trial can be drawn to the attention of unemployed people at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could also be argued that six months is not too soon for people to take advantage of the concession. After six months away from work, they may fear that they will have difficulty reintegrating themselves into employment. I accept the principle behind amendment No. 66, but we want to define the groups which could take advantage of it in secondary, nor primary, legislation. Therefore, I give the Committee an undertaking that if the amendment is withdrawn, I shall ensure that the principle of 26 rather than 52 weeks is incorporated in the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what the Minister has said. I presume that when he talked about secondary legislation, he meant regulations that would be introduced at a later stage. I do not want to tie him down to an exact timetable, but a rough idea of what he anticipates would be helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We want to get the regulations laid as soon as possible after Royal Assent. The hon. Gentleman will have his own idea of when Royal Assent is likely to be, but we shall lay, and eventually debate, the regulations sometime later this year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister talks about regulations for specific professions, presumably he has in mind a number of circumstances, some of which may not be apparent now. Has he a rough idea of the sort of circumstances that he will be considering?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not thinking about particular professions, but particular situation which I outlined broadly. I mentioned people who have been sick, people who have been unemployed for a long time, and people who, although not young, are entering

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>519</span>
paid employment for the first time, because they have been caring for relatives and others. They may be anxious about entering employment and need special help. Those are the type of categories that I have in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I obviously welcome what the Minister is saying, he seems to be implying that people who have been carers might be eligible for a trial period only if they have never been in employment before. Does he accept that what applies to people who have been out of the labour market for a long time because of unemployment or illness should also apply to carers who enter the market for the first time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would certainly like to capture the spirit of the hon. Lady's comments in the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[MR. MCWILLIAM 	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) said. We welcome the Minister's suggestions, and look forward to seeing that point in the regulations when they are presented to us in the early hours of the morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome particularly the categories outlined by the Minister. We hope to expand on the idea of gentling people back into work, especially those who have suffered sickness, mental illness, and those for whom unemployment has become a way of life. We hope that the spirit behind his using the carrot rather than the stick is contagious. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, my hon. Friend cannot do that. May we clarify the position? The Minister is prepared to accept amendment No. 101 and he said that he would like us to withdraw amendment No. 66 because he intends to give effect to it in other ways.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>5.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 103, in page 6, line 40, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or permanently losing all or part of any entitlement which he had before accepting such employment to transitional protection of any benefit entitlement".</p></blockquote>
I hope that, in the new spirit of sweetness and light, the Minister will accept the amendment because it deals with an extremely important subject. We welcome the provision for a trial period for people who have been unemployed for six months rather than a year. They will be able to take on a job for 13 weeks as a trial and not be subject to loss of benefit for six months if they find that job unsatisfactory. That is entirely desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have another worry about people being invited to take on a job, finding it unsuitable, going back on benefit and being worse off than they had been because they have lost their transitionary protected benefits. It would be entirely against the spirit of the new provision for the Government not to protect transitional benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>520</span>
Many people are now beginning to feel the losses as a result of the transitional protection con. That was all about massaging a reduction in entitlement to benefit and not having one day on which people's benefits were suddenly reduced and the anger that that would have produced. There was a guarantee that no one would have his or her benefit reduced even though the new system meant that new claimants were on a lower benefit. Inflation was left to erode the transitional protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past few weeks, a number of cases involving that problem have been through my advice bureau. Mr. William Smith of 38 Kentish road, Handsworth is a 53-year-old man who had been unemployed for some time and was desperately seeking work. He was offered seven weeks' work. So keen was he to work that although, after taking into account bus fares and so on, he would be left only £15 a week better off, he was anxious to take the job. He went along informally to a local benefit office and was told that he would not pay any price for taking the job, so he took his seven weeks' work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When he went back on benefit, because the work had always been temporary, he found himself £3.69 a week worse off because he had lost his transitional protection. He felt extremely angry because he had inquired about whether he would have any problems and had been told that he would not. He appealed, and the chairman of the tribunal said that the appellant's honesty in declaring a short term of employment led to a break in his claim with a consequent loss of transitional addition. The chairman suggested that he should go to see his Member of Parliament, which he duly did. I duly wrote and, of course, nothing was done about it. I hope that all members of the Committee will agree that it is wrong that a man who was genuinely seeking to get back into the labour market and took temporary work because that was all that was available should lose his transitional protection. As a result of his keenness he found himself worse off seven weeks later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other cases that I have seen recently are more distressing, but they are not directly relevant to the amendment. One concerned the mother of a severely disabled child who is hyperactive and incontinent. She was in receipt of some £20 a week, consisting of transitional protection, allowances for laundry, special diets and so on. The child is seven or eight. The strain on a family of looking after such a child is great. When the mother came to see me she was obviously under a lot of pressure and strain. She had left her husband for two days and then regretted it and returned. The couple had not really fallen out— there was just so much tension in the family from looking after that hyperactive child that she flipped and decided to live on her own. She went to the benefit office to explain what she was doing. When she returned to her husband she was told that they had lost their £20 a week transitional protection. In that case, with some sympathetic bending of the rules, we were able to get it back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I received a letter this morning from a woman whose husband had been sent to prison. She also had a disabled child and had recently had a miscarriage.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>521</span>
Nothing had changed for that woman except that her husband had been sent to prison. Because the claim was no longer in his name but was in hers the transitional protection was lost. A similar problem could arise for a family in extreme circumstances where someone who had previously been unemployed took the opportunity offered by the trial period to take a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sincerely hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. This should be a good concession that gives people who have been out of the labour market the chance to try a job without suffering a serious loss of benefit if they find the job unsatisfactory. Such people should not be conned by assurances that they will not lose out, when they are in danger of losing their transitional protection. It would be deeply wrong if the Government invited people into that trap. I hope that the Minister will accept the spirit of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two reasons why I hope that the Minister will agree to the amendment. First, Nick Warren, the lawyer with whom I work in Birkenhead, has acted before the commissioner. The presentation of the Moran case has been completed and we await the finding. We shall discover whether the Government were behaving lawfully in abolishing housing benefit supplement the day before the new scheme came into being. It would be a graceful move on the part of the Government at least if they at least ensured that those who are attempting to move back to work are not further penalised. I guess that by the end of the week the Government's policy on housing benefit supplement and the supposed transitional protection that was introduced will be in tatters. We look forward to the Government's response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, an important point is at issue. Several of my constituents know that they take a double risk in taking temporary work. The risk that they willingly take is that while the job may well come to an end, there is a chance that once they are in the labour market they will hear of other work that will lead to more permanent employment. That should be encouraged. The flip side is that when they come back it takes some time before they get their benefit and they will be penalised by losing transitional protection. I am sure that that is not the Government's aim. Indeed, if the labour market is changing as fast as the Minister is always telling us it is, and if it will get tighter and tighter, surely the Government's social security hand should know what their employment hand is doing. The Government should make it as easy as possible for people to move off welfare into the labour market. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood, I hope that the Government will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complex area with wide-ranging implications. Because the amendment is about income support, this clause is not the most appropriate part of the Bill to amend. I do not criticise Opposition Members for tabling the amendment to this clause, but it would be more appropriate elsewhere in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short), transitional protection is an
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>522</span>
exceptional provision to prevent claimants from experiencing a sudden drop in benefit when they change to the new system. It will cost £200 million in its first year and is designed to give people time to become accustomed to the new levels of benefit entitlement. Claimants who satisfy the trial conditions and leave their employment will not lose their transitional protection in income support of £10 or more if the break in receipt of that benefit is less than eight weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see what the Opposition are trying to achieve, but the amendment is not the right way to do it. We may wish to consider carefully any implications on other benefits, including sickness and disability benefits. Although I cannot give the Committee an absolute undertaking that I shall be able to put forward a proposal to achieve that end, I accept that the Opposition have a genuine point. I shall therefore consider carefully what might be done and see whether we can properly achieve what the amendment seeks. If so, I shall move a Government amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister, who is right to respond in that spirit. He says that people on transitional benefit of £10 or more will not lose their transitional protection if they return to benefit after eight weeks in the labour market, and we should like to build on that principle. However, it seems wrong that that regulation stipulates a trial period of eight weeks and the Bill stipulates a period of longer than eight weeks. That is nonsense and needs sorting out. Furthermore, why should people with a larger amount of transitional protection be treated better than those with a smaller amount? There is no logic or fairness in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Minister cannot immediately give us an absolute undertaking, because the cost must be checked with the Treasury, and so on, but that he gives a firm commitment that, if possible, he will amend the clause. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>; I beg to move amendment No. 104, in page 6, line 42, leave out from "of to end of line 43 and insert

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman reminds me of an old school teacher of mine, who used to ask me a question every

morning. The first morning he asked, "How many 3¾d in £1 10s?" I said "96 sir." He said, "how many in £1 million?" and I said, "64 million, sir." He said, "How many in £21 million?" and I said "1,344 million, sir." He said, "How many in £42 million?" and I said "2,688 million, sir." He then asked how I calculated that and I said that, when I was in primary school I was taught that twice 3¾d was 7½d and twice 7½d was Is 3d. There were two Is 3d in half a crown, four 3¾d in Is 3d and eight in half a crown. I multiplied the eight by eight and made 64. There 64 in £1 and 64 million in £1 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give £5 to your charity, Mr. McWilliam, if I am wrong. I do not think that the non. Member for Dorset, South is as clever as he thinks. Will he answer an elementary question? If he gives me the right answer without hesitation, I shall gladly give £5 to charity. What is half of 99?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with the length of the trial period during which a person will be allowed to leave a job voluntarily without losing entitlement to unemployment benefit. The Government propose that the person would have to stay in the job for at least six weeks, and that to get benefit under the concession, he would have to leave by the end of the 12th week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 104 means that a person could leave a job at any time during the first 12 weeks, instead of having to stay at least six weeks. If someone takes a job that turns out to be a disaster, for whatever reason, it is absurd to make him stick at it for six weeks. It would be six weeks of misery for the employee, and the employer would have to hang on to someone who could not cope with the job, or who was a danger to himself and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have moved the amendment because it is a piece of nonsense that a person must stay in employment for six weeks. Obviously, if someone does not like a job he or she will want to give it up. Clause 7 and the "actively seeking work" test could force people to take jobs that are totally unsuitable. Obviously, many people will take unsuitable jobs. That is why we wish to amend the clause. Let us suppose that a woman takes a job and is sexually harassed. Must she put up with six weeks of sexual harassment before giving up the job?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Employees may have to stay on and do tasks that they do not like. In my first job, I went with my billy can to have a tea break. The employer said, "Where are you going?" I replied, "I'm going for a tea break." We were working in two flats. I went up to the top flat and said, "The boys downstairs said that if you go for a tea break, they will go for a tea break." Then I went downstairs and said, "The boys upstairs said that if you go for a tea break they will go for a tea break." The result was that we got a tea break, and there had been no tea break in that job, but I was sacked a couple of weeks later. That is the way in which bad employers treat workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux has brought other cases to our attention. Client A was employed as a cleaner for only two
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>524</span>
days. She handed in her notice because she found out that her employer would not pay her national insurance contribution. Her unemployment benefit was taken from her because she left that job after two days. That is unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Client D was unemployed, but took a job on a trial basis. However, a poor working environment worsened. The client had asthma and felt that he had to leave that job. Again, he was disqualified from unemployment benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society of Scotland examines all legislation. It states quite clearly:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although we can see merit in facilitating a trial period, we believe that there should be a saving for cases where there is some illegality or irregularity in the terms and conditions of employment. We envisage such situations as where the employee is required to work in dangerous conditions or irregular hours, where no warning of that fact has been given in advance. A person who accepts hotel work for example might find that there was a requirement to work long and unspecified hours, beyond those at which public transport would be available."</p></blockquote>
That is the type of thing that people are worried about. Employers do not take such matters into consideration. They do not give employees travelling expenses or taxi money when they work anti-social hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other more serious problem is that if people with an invalidity pension work on a trial basis for eight weeks, they are disqualified from benefit. That also happens to people with a severe disablement allowance and those claiming sickness benefit—after working for eight weeks, their benefits are discontinued. That is why we want the Committee to accept the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that worries the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux is the quality of the decisions made by the adjudication officers. They seem to be going for the 26-week ban at all times. They do not give any chance to the person who leaves a job before the end of the six-week period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions do not give any time for readjustment. We all know that people who have been long unemployed need time to adjust, physically and psychologically. To say that they can readjust in 12 weeks is unfair. Only the other night the 	<i>Evening Times</i> in Scotland had seven pages on the physical effect of long-term unemployment and the state of health of people who have been out of work for more than two years. Amendment No. 106 means that at least people would not jump out of a job after 12 weeks, but might stay for six months. That would give them a fairer chance to readjust. I do not think that that is asking a lot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to consider changing the time factors in the Bill, as proposed in amendments Nos. 104 and 106.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Gentleman put the case succinctly. I should just like to ask what consultations, if any,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>525</span>
there have been with employers' organisations on the effect of the ludicrous proposal of a six to 12-week trial period. The amendment would make the situation in the workplace much clearer. There is a trial period, which I think is a fair, welcome and sensible provision, but why have this artificial break point? It will give rise to difficulties about when a contract started, and so on. People will be looking at their calendar to see how many weeks have passed, to make sense of their situation. If the CBI, and other bodies that I should have expected the Government to consult before introducing the Bill, had been confronted with the Government's plans, they would have given the proposals short shrift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be wrong—perhaps I am missing something in the argument—but I cannot see the advantage to employers in the proposed scheme. Neither can I see the sense of it for the Government; I do not see the reasoning behind the two-tiered timing for the trial period. If it is a trial period, it should extend to the whole time—there should be no distinction between six and 12 weeks. I do not see the point of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, but no doubt he will come back to me if I do not get it right. We did not consult employers specifically, but employers, the CBI and similar organisations have well-developed facilities for monitoring legislation. Hon. Members have no doubt received over the years, as I have, briefs on a range of matters relating to employment. I am sure that if employers' organisations had felt concerned about the proposals, members of the Committee would have heard from them before now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are in new territory. We are introducing a concession and calling it a trial period for the person returning to employment or coming to employment for the first time. It is a new approach, enabling people who have been unused to employment for a long period to get back without the prospect that if the whole thing falls apart within a limited period they will be disqualified. If there were difficulties that led to people leaving employment within six weeks of starting, they would have the opportunity to show that they had just cause for leaving and they would thus retain their entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Six weeks is a reasonable period. I accept that such periods have to be chosen in a rather arbitrary fashion at the beginning to see how they work out. We do not necessarily have it exactly right, but I think that six weeks is a fair period to show that somebody has not taken up the job in a cavalier fashion and then walked out of it the first time that something went wrong. He would have given the job a good try; after six weeks, if he decided that things were not working out, he would benefit from the concession in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 106 pushes out the limits at the end of the period. One must make a judgment about the point at which it is proper to say that a person is trying out the job in a serious way, and the point when he moves into permanent employment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I notice that the Minister did not pay any attention to what I said about the people who would lose their invalidity pensions and those on severe disablement allowance who would be disqualified.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On amendment No. 106, the Minister should consider the position of someone who has been unemployed for two or three years and who has to readjust, which the medical experts have made clear is difficult. The Government must seriously consider the physical and psychological problems of the long-term unemployed if they want to redeploy them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a period during which people who leave employment will be exempt from the normal rules. If a person left beyond that period and could show just cause for leaving, he would not be disqualified from benefit. I think that what we propose is worth a trial and that the Committee as a whole welcomes it. The people concerned will be exempt from the rules about voluntarily leaving employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is clear that those who drafted the Bill, and clause 9, were thinking of people "kangarooing" in and out of jobs, or of those who took jobs and then left them after a couple of weeks.

me more than once that the reason for having the longest time in the Bill as 12 weeks is not that the Government have had the benefits of psychological and other advice suggesting that that is the correct period, but that if people stayed for 13 weeks, they would be able to requalify for unemployment benefit under clause 8, and the Government are anxious to ensure that that does not happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 107, in page 7, line 21, leave out from "provision" to end of line 22 and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"restricting the meaning of 'employment' for the purposes of section 20(1) or modifying its meaning for the purposes of any other".</p></blockquote>
The amendment deals with the power in clause 9(4) to make
	<br><blockquote><p>"Regulations … modifying the meaning of 'employment' for the purposes of any provision"</p></blockquote>
of the 1975 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members that as at present defined in schedule 20 of that Act, "employment"
	<br><blockquote><p>"includes any trade, business, profession, office or vocation".</p></blockquote>
According to the notes on clauses with which Members of the Committee have been supplied, the Government intend to use the regulation-making power explicitly to widen the scope of that definition to cover part-time or temporary employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been some dispute over the extent to which the present law could be used to compel a person to take up part-time employment, although the matter of temporary employment has not arisen so far in the Committee. Nevertheless, irrespective of the circumstances, the individual's past history, or whether he or she is actively seeking work but—as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>528</span>
most Opposition Members would think fair—wishes to direct the search towards full-time work, the Government are seeking to make sure that the work towards which the person might be pushed, or the test of seeking work that could be applied, should specifically include part-time or temporary employment. It is yet another way in which to widen and weaken the provision on "suitable" employment in section 20 of the 1975 Act. One cannot be disqualified at present for refusing employment unless it is suitable. In certain circumstances, with a particular individual or job, an adjudication officer might reasonably decide that part-time or temporary work was not suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As you know from your brief time with us earlier, Mr. McWilliam, Opposition Members are alarmed at the way in which the Bill might be used to harass people who are unemployed. They might be pushed into work that is not just part-time and temporary but very low paid. A person might be liable to lose unemployment benefit for refusing a part-time job that offers only a few hours of low-paid work each week, even if taking that job might make it more difficult to pursue work in a full-time occupation that he or she might prefer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, people may be pushed to take temporary work which is low paid and of uncertain duration, and which might handicap their getting more suitable employment at a later stage. Here we go to the heart of the differences between the Government and the Opposition and how we believe the legislation will work in practice. We foresee the effect on some DSS officer in a local office who has doubts about a claimant's active speech for work, or—the Minister considers that this cannot happen—if a claimant is difficult, or makes a bad impression on the officer, or even if that officer is having a bad day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill may require people to give officers assurances that they will take any job at no matter how ludicrously low pay, in whatever terrible conditions, however part-time or temporary it may be. I and most of my hon. Friends can readily envisage a person with some pride, hope and expectation—however ill-founded—of obtaining what could be considered a proper job, saying, in sheer exasperation, "No, I will not agree to take any old rubbishy job, no matter how low the pay and how shocking the conditions. Why should I? I am looking for work as hard as anybody could, but what I am looking for is a decent job and fair wages and conditions." By daring to say that, a person might be ruled not to be actively seeking work, and he denied entitlement to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possibility of so explicity widening the definition of employment as to bring in not only part-time, but even temporary, work might be one of the most damaging provisions of the Bill, because it removes any floor from the sort of employment against which a person's willingness to seek work might be tested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would ensure that the regulation-making power envisaged in section 20 could be used only to restrict the meaning of employment, not to widen it. I recognise that that may be a technical device that enables us to raise the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0315">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>529</span>
issue, but I hope that the Minister will for once give us some assurances in which we can place some credence, although it is hard to see what they might be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister I should like to inform hon. Members of my intention to suspend the sitting from 7.30 pm until 9 pm— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The Committee may find it strange, but I have no knowledge of how long we shall sit this evening. It is always my practice to give an hour's notice of when I intend to suspend for a break because that is a matter only for the Chairman. It is merely a courtesy to the Committee. I have no knowledge when the Committee wishes to suspend for the evening—that is a matter for the Whips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lest other members of the Committee have suffered the same shock on hearing that announcement, may I say that I hope—especially today—that hon. Members might feel it appropriate to dine with their spouses, partners or whatever. I hope that the usual channels can make suitable arrangements for that. If not, all kinds of costs may be involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett). She raised the amendment to ascertain our intentions. There is no intention to widen the definition of employment as a result of what we have included in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the present provision, part-time and temporary work can be offered. We are anxious to ensure that the present definition of employment in schedule 20 can be modified by regulation to make provision for part-time or temporary employment. I assure the hon. Lady that our sole intention is to use the power to provide that the term "employment" for the purposes of section 20(1)(b) and (c) of the Social Security Act 1975 shall exclude employment of less than 24 hours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Benefit claimants will not suffer a benefit sanction for refusing to seek or accept employment if the employment in question is part-time and is for less than 24 hours a week. Committee members will recognise the significance of the 24 hours because of its relevance to claims for family credit. It is sensible to use that existing provision to determine what employment should mean for the purposes of a sanction for refusing to seek or accept employment. I hope that the hon. Lady will see some merit in that approach and withdraw her amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish I could believe the Minister and the assurance he is giving us. The removal of "suitable", which means that no-one can be penalised or required to take a job unless it is suitable, opens up the horrible prospect of people being penalised if they refuse to accept part-time or temporary jobs that they would not have been forced to accept under the old legislation because of the existence of the word "suitable". That is a major change which has massive implications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Something has changed in this Bill since the notes on clauses were drafted. All kinds of tightening up
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>530</span>
appears to have taken place, but in this instance we are told that the Government are thinking of including part-time or temporary employment in the employment definition. That cannot be an accident. The Minister says that it was there before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has misunderstood. We are limiting the effect of all that so that any reference to part-time employment would apply only to employment of 24 hours or more. If the offered work was less than that, no sanction could apply to someone who refused the job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the job was shocking, even if the work was for a longer period, someone who declined to take the job or left it could well show that they had just cause for so doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That sounds very reasonable but I should like to read from the notes on clauses, which say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Use of regulation making power under subsection (4) Employment is currently defined in section 20 of the Social Security Act 1975 as a term which 'includes any trade, business, profession, office or vocation.'"</p></blockquote>
The second sentence says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The regulation making power may be used to widen the scope of this definition to cover, for instance 'part-time' or 'temporary' employment."</p></blockquote>
Presumably it is no accident that the notes on clauses show that the regulating making power would be used in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also aware of the other changes being made in the Bill to remove the protection that people can be offered suitable employment only. Those changes exert greater pressure on them to accept jobs requiring them to seek work actively each week and mean that their benefit will be removed on a weekly basis if they do not do so. When we take that together with what is promised in the notes on clauses under subsection (4) defining part-time or temporary employment as employment, the implication seems clear—the Government are planning to define employment more widely and to force people, under threat of benefit loss, to take on a temporary or part-time job whatever the income. Those notes do not make sense unless that is the Government's intention. The Minister has said that, far from it, the Government's intention is only to ensure that no-one will be penalised into taking a job that is less than 24 hours duration. That is the assurance given to us by the Minister. The two things do not add up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why do the notes on clauses say what they do? If the Minister's assurance is true, I believe that he could accept our amendment because it says that the regulating making powers will not broaden but only narrow the definition of employment. If all he means to do is to deal with the 24 hours job in the way he has suggested and if he has good faith and means what he said, he should accept our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Lady would not question my good faith. Let me explain it again. The term is defined in the Social Security Act 1975 as:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any trade, business, profession, office or vocation."</p></blockquote>
It does not say full-time. The phrase in the notes on clauses which uses the word "widen" uses it in a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>531</span>
different sense from that which I used when responding to the hon. Lady. Then I said that we were trying to restrict rather than widen the definition. It will cover not only full-time employment, but make it clear that it also covers part-time employment. But for the purposes of section 20(1) of the Social Security Act 1975, part-time employment shall only justify any sanction if it is for 24 hours or more whereas under the existing law such employment could be taken to imply the part-time or temporary employment and the part-time employment for any number of hours a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take it that 24 hours means 24 hours in one week. There are part-time jobs where the hours are flexible. Sometimes one can work more and sometimes less. How would the adjudicating officer view a part-time job over a period of six months? Would it be judged to under 24 hours or over? Is there an average because one could work 26 hours some weeks to help out and find oneself above the band the Minister has described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To tell the truth, I do not know the simple answer. I hope that Opposition Members would welcome the fact that we are taking steps to define part-time employment so that it applies only to jobs of 24 hours a week or more. Adjudication officers may average them out, as they do for family credit. I do not know technically how it would be done, but I hope that the Committee will accept that it is a genuine effort to restrict the definition of part-time work, and therefore not to make any person liable to a sanction if the work is for 24 hours or fewer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must admit that, although I have listened with care to the Minister, it is not always easy to understand. Opposition Members have found in the past that phrases that the Minister has used do not always mean quite what we took them to mean at first glance. It is not wholly clear to me what he is saying, but I understand him to be applying a consistent definition of part-time and full-time work as applied in the family credit and income support scheme. The figure is 24 hours. It is not clear how that will affect use of this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I and my hon. Friends will wish to study what the Minister has said. If it appears that the Minister is doing something less damaging than we imagine, we shall find it hard to believe our ears. Usually our disbelieve turns out to be well founded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until I have had the opportunity to study what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 128, in page 7, line 23, after "Act" insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"and shall provide that for the purposes of this section 'employment' means employment that is appropriate for the claimant having regard to the level of remuneration, hours of work and other conditions of employment, the working environment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>532</span>
and the skills, qualifications and other circumstances of the climant.".</p></blockquote>
It is appropriate that this is the final amendment tabled by the Opposition, for I move it with great enthusiasm. It represents a middle position or bridge between the two sides, following the many points made in Committee. The effect of the amendment would be that a person could be disqualified for refusing or leaving employment only if that employment were "appropriate". In deciding whether a job was appropriate the adjudication officer would have to take into account all the factors mentioned in the amendment, including the rate of pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would not, as earlier amendments would have, reintroduce the concept of suitable employment, or the detailed provision of section 24 of the 1975 Act regarding employment that is not deemed to be suitable. It proposes a more general, almost a two-stage test, of whether the job is appropriate for the claimant. It would be a refinement of what is now suggested, and would go some way to meeting some of our objections to the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the job were not appropriate, perhaps because the wages were unreasonably low, no question of disqualification for refusing it could arise. If it were appropriate, however, the claimant would have to show good cause for refusing it. At that stage, and only then, the level of pay would have to be disregarded. In other words, if the pay and other conditions were appropriate, the claimant would not be able to argue that he had good cause for refusing the job because he wanted a better-paid job. If the pay and other conditions were not appropriate, the reasons why he turned it down would be irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of our debates, the amendment offers a reasoned compromise between the two views. Unemployed people would not be expected to take any job, however low-paid or otherwise inappropriate to their circumstances; but if the pay and other conditions were reasonable, they would be expected to take the job even if they would have preferred to wait for one better paid. The amendment provides an opportunity for clarification of what has been said this morning about what would happen if a job were advertised at a jobcentre and privately at the same time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is intended that a person who applies privately will be allowed to refuse the job, if offered, on the grounds of low pay, a person who applies for the same job at a jobcentre will not. Does the fact that a job is notified at a jobcentre mean that nobody may turn it down on the grounds of low pay? If that is the intention, how is anyone to know whether a job advertised privately has also been notified to a jobcentre?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a good try to get back as close as possible to the concept of "suitable" employment while choosing alternative adjectives but many of the same criteria. I have already explained to the Committee the concept of the permitted period, and why, beyond that, we expect people to be prepared

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>533</span>
to look past the horizons of their previous employment, the conditions, level of pay, and the type of employment itself, and to be actively seeking work elsewhere. It is an attempt to undermine the fundamental concept of this part of the Bill, and I cannot commend it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must stick closely to what I said to the Committee this morning. I am anxious to tackle the question of a person's being offered a job privately at unacceptably low wages, and because he had refused it for him to be liable to be disqualified from benefit. I want to find a way through regulations preventing that from happening, but cannot say exactly how it is possible to do it, nor what the impact might be on other sources through which the job might be advertised. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept my assurance this morning that that is my intention. It is much too early to say how we might tackle it through regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give a firm assurance that it is not the Government's intention that people who are seeking full-time work and need that income shall be penalised by having their benefit taken away if they refuse a part-time job?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At present, part-time and temporary work may be offered, and now we have the limit of 24 hours of which I spoke earlier. It is impossible to give an absolute, clear response to the hon. Lady's question. It will depend on the regulations, and eventually on adjudication officers' taking all circumstances into account. There might be some circumstances in which it was thought that a temporary or part-time job would be appropriate to that claimant and those circumstances. There is certainly no general wish for us to push people towards temporary or part-time employment, but we all recognise that such employment is an increasing feature of the modern employment market—for some good reasons as well as what the hon. Lady may regard as bad. It is impossible to give the assurance for which she asks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This worries me very much. The Bill would remove any possibility for people to give the income offered as an objection to accepting a job. Many people refuse part-time work because of the income that it would offer. They do not object to the nature of the work itself. The hourly rate might be adequate, but the total income that they would earn in any week from working part-time would be inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Bill for the first time removes the right for anyone to give as a reason for objecting to a job that the pay is too low, if the Minister will not give us an assurance on this the prospects are bad for all sorts of people. We know that those included in the unemployed benefit count are people seeking full-time jobs. Those seeking part-time jobs are not included in that count and are not eligible for benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see the shaking of heads, but in practice that is the case; people who are available only for part-time work are not included in the benefit count. Everyone will understand my worry about someone who needs
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>534</span>
a certain income each week but is required to take a part-time job. The Minister might say that that person will be eligible for family credit, but that would apply only to those with dependants under 16. There are other people with responsibilities to partners, spouses, elderly parents or others who may be dependent on them. Such people may be forced to take a part-time job on a low income under the provisions of the Bill and would have absolutely no right to reject that, even if the income from their part-time job was lower than their benefit entitlement. We have been through that amendment and the Minister has refused to accept it. It is extremely troubling that the Minister thinks that a 24-hour assurance is all right, and that apart from that he need give us no assurance. The prospect for many people genuinely seeking full-time jobs is that to get the income which they need to survive, they will be forced to do part-time work and live on the very low income from that work. The Minister seems untroubled by that concern.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall respond by correcting the hon. Lady's impression. Many people claiming unemployment benefit are accepted as available only for part-time work under the present system and would therefore be included in the count. The hon. Lady asked me to give an assurance that in no circumstances would an offer of part-time or temporary employment be suitable; I could not conceive of giving her that undertaking. There might be circumstances in which it would be an appropriate offer to make, but I cannot go further than that now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I may have missed the debate in the Committee earlier on the point that I am about to make; if so, I apologise. I am very concerned. I come from a rural constituency; the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) comes from an urban constituency, so her concerns are different. I have equally urgent worries about how the abolition of the test of suitability will affect workers in rural areas. In those areas there are greater distances to be covered and therefore travelling expenses and travel time are important. One can travel 45 or 50 miles in an hour in my constituency; it would cost a lot of money and it could not be done without private transport. As hon. Members will know public transport in rural areas is getting worse because of the deregulation of buses—that is certainly true in my area—and it will get worse in the future. Travel to work is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a natural consequence of its being a rural area, tourism is important. That is a seasonal industry and, like catering, it is part-time and low-paid work. The textile and electronics industries in my constituency pay relatively high wages in terms of the national average, but many other jobs in hotels and tourism, are paid at a very low hourly rate, even if they are full-time. If a frame worker in the textile industry, or a skilled tractor man, goes to the jobcentre in periods of unemployment and asks for work, would they be referred to catering, tourism or some other job that may be some distance from their local community? If people refuse these jobs, in wholly different disciplines, for much lower wages, will they be denied unemployment benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0318">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>535</span>
It is also important to know what the role of unsocial hours will be in the new legislation. Particularly in catering, unsocial hours are part of the job. Will those hours be forced on people who normally work an industrial week in a factory or plant in the textile or electronics industry? Will people be required to change their work patterns completely? Share fishermen is another category that has occurred to me. That occupation is unique to the inshore Scottish fishing industry. I have inshore fishermen in Alnmouth in my constituency who do not fit into the present categories of employment. As the Minister knows, there are special signing-on provisions in the unemployment benefit regulations for share fishermen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should not raise these matters. If I kept quiet, the Government might not notice. However, we should look at the provision for share fishermen in the proposed legislation. We should like to have some answers to that point this evening. If not, I give the Minister due notice that we shall return to it once I have asked the fishermen in my constituency what they think of the Bill. I will return to the attack, if I cannot get any answers this evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many matters of concern, not just to members representing urban constituencies but also to those trying to do their best for rural areas. The Committee should also consider the Bill in relation to people in those areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was absent when I mentioned that we would set down in regulations what a good cause for not accepting an offer of a job would be. The impact on health and journey time would be considered. A reasonable time would be one hour's journey in each direction. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) said that in London that may take one only next door, but in rural areas it could take one a great distance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Minister talked about an hour he was careful to say that it would be unreasonable to say that less than one hour was too much travelling. He gave no assurance beyond that. It was put in a negative, rather than a positive sense, so the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) must not take it that if someone who had to travel for one and a half hours refused a job, that would be accepted automatically as good cause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was saying that this was the one area where we would define in regulations not what was, but what was not, a good cause. It would not be good cause if the travelling time was less than an hour in each direction, unless someone's health or disability made that an unacceptable travelling time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is impossible to make a journey of that length in my constituency unless one has private transport. One cannot get from Kelso to Hawick in reasonable times to suit employers by the present system of public transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hour would be calculated by people using the most appropriate form of available

transport. It may well be different in the hon. Gentleman's constituency from in London.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.00 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The question of the job advertised privately in jobcentres must remain an enigma. There are however, changes going on under the surface which leave us not to discouraged. The bare bones of the Bill were pretty miserable and we are having great difficulty thrashing them out, but the Frankenstein is appearing. We welcome the Minister's expression, "unacceptable low level of wage" because it has been echoed by the Opposition. We have made that point continually, but were asked by the Minister to wait. We will wait. I am rather more naive and gullible than other members of the Committee, as this is my first Standing Committee. We hope that there can be a serious improvement to this dismal Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We expected the Minister to be more generous and to recognise that there is a real difference between what has been suggested in the amendment and what has been suggested previously. There is a difference and a two-tiered test would have taken us some way in the right direction. I accept that the Minister is set against that idea, and I am shocked that he does not have the agility of mind to understand a highly convoluted argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am becoming confused. I want to put a direct question to the Minister and I hope to obtain an answer. Am I right in thinking that the Government would feel it reasonable to ask somebody to catch a 7 am bus to arrive at a destination an hour later to start a job at 9.30 am?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is impossible for a Minister to stand here and start answering individual cases like that. It is up to those who adjudicate on these matters to take all the circumstances into account. It might be acceptable in certain circumstances and not in others. We are talking about reasonable journey times to and from work. That is a concept worth incorporating in the regulations. It would be travel by normal means. If a person had a car, that would be taken into account, but nobody would be expected to take a taxi to get to work. A bus or train would normally be the most appropriate method for a person to get to work. Waiting some time to return from or to get to work is something that we have all experienced from time to time, and exactly what the most appropriate period would be is for the adjudication officer to decide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 108, in page 7, line 23, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(5) Nothing in subsection (1 A) above shall affect the continuing operation of the Unemployment Benefit (Disqualification Period) Order 1988 (which substituted the period of 26 weeks for the period of 13 weeks in section 20(1) of the principal Act)."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Government amendments Nos 109 and 110.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>537</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will recall that, following acceptance of amendment No. 92—perhaps the first concession that was made—for which the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) argued convincingly, I explained that I accepted the principle of his. amendment but that some consequential amendments were necessary. They involve clause 9 and schedule 7, and together will achieve the change sought by the Committee and put beyond doubt the liberty of the present order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 92, which the Government so graciously accepted, prevented their extending the period for which people could be disqualified beyond 26 weeks. We seem to have fallen on a seam of gold here. The fact that the Government find it necessary to table amendments Nos. 108 and 110 seems to suggest that amendment No. 92 called into question the Government's extension of the disqualification period from 13 to 26 weeks. As we are strongly opposed to that extension of the disqualification period, we oppose the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not argue at length. My hon. Friends agree that it would be unreasonable to cut people's benefit for six months as a penalty for not taking the sort of unsuitable jobs that would be on offer. We shall therefore vote against amendment No. 108. Amendment No. 109 is acceptable and necessary, and is a true consequential amendment, whereas amendments Nos. 108 and 110 are not. The Government were caught out in accepting the principle of amendment No. 92.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
