	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Social Security Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) may I remind the Committee that the amendments we are about to discuss are very narrow. I hope that remarks will relate directly to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 7</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT: REQUIREMENT TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT ACTIVELY</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 44, in page 4, line 45, after "which", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>", if there is a reasonable prospect of his obtaining suitable employment in the local labour market,".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 52, in page 5, line 9, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3A) After subsection (2) there shall be inserted the following subsection—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'() Regulations shall prescribe the local ratio of notified employment vacancies to registered unemployed persons below which a person shall be deemed to be actively seeking employment.'.".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are narrow but extremely important. They would amend the Bill so that the availability of jobs in the local labour market is taken into account. Government rhetoric constantly stresses that the number of jobs registered at jobcentres can be multiplied by three to give the number of jobs available in the economy and claim that research shows that repeatedly. The crude equation is that there are 700,000 vacancies and 2.4 million unemployed, according to the much-reduced Government figures. It is suggested that if people only tried harder and looked for work more actively, unemployment would be significantly reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a lot of misunderstanding here: some hon. Members genuinely misunderstand and others pretend to misunderstand how the figures are made up. Therefore, I shall explain briefly the nature of vacancies and skill shortages and how they are filled, and then come to the details of the local labour market. The 700,000 vacancies that exist in the economy at any one time no more represent a static pool of unfilled vacancies waiting to be occupied by the unemployed that the figure of 2.4 million unemployed claimants represents a static pool of unemployment. Both figures are snapshots of substantial flows. Each month, some 400,000 people enter unemployment, either by leaving or losing a
	<span class='label label-info column'>242</span>
job or by newly entering the labour market. A similar number obtain jobs or quit the labour market through retirement, motherhood, full-time education or whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The official unemployment figure at any one time is the accumulated or reduced balance between the two flows. Similarly, vacancy figures for a particular day represent the rising or falling cumulative balance between a constant inflow of new vacancies and a constant outlow of filled vacancies. If we look at the duration of vacancies—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Dorset, South (Mr. Bruce) is reading a newspaper. That is totally out of order either in the Chamber or in Committee. I hope that he will refrain from doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: An examination of the median duraton of unfilled jobcentre vacancies tells us something about the efficiency of our labour market and the take-up of vacancies. The latest figures that I have available are for March 1988; I would be happy to receive more recent figures from Ministers. In March 1988, the median duration ranged from 2.4 weeks in the north-west—a region of high unemployment—to 4.8 weeks in the south-east. If hon. Members use their common sense rather than follow their ideological prejudices, they will not be surprised to learn that a large proportion of the vacancies are filled by job changers and new labour market entrants, either school or college leavers or women entering employment when their children reach school or nursery age. Therefore, unemployed claimants have to compete for jobs with job changers, new entrants and re-entrants to the labour market. The longer a person is out of work, the more difficult it is for him or her to compete successfully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have mentioned the figures before, so I shall not dwell on them. I owe you an apology, Mr. Winterton, about the figures for the number of applications people in job clubs have made, which I said were different. I understand from my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) that the figures are the same. I am sorry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Lady for uniquely apologising to the Chairman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I have already quoted the figures, they are important for our understanding of what is going on in our labour market and the unsuitability and inappropriateness both of the requirement that people look actively for work every week and of the belief that somehow that will lead to a reduction in unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fastest job growth since March 1983 has been among women, part-time employees. The Government constantly boast about the total employee increase since 1983 of 974,000—nearly 1 million—but they forget to mention the 2 million jobs destroyed between 1979–83. Of the 974,000 new jobs, 682,000 are for women, part-time workers. Jobs for women part-timers are increasing at a rate of around 3 per cent., the number for women full-timers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>243</span>
is increasing by 2 per cent. annually, but male full-time employment is virtually static. It is no surprise that that trend is reflected in vacancies. Any analysis of vacancies shows that the overwhelming majority are part time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is that people are not allowed to be in receipt of unemployment benefit or be a statistic in unemployment figures unless they seek full-time work. Since 1983, most of the jobs for new entrants to the labour market have been for those who are not included in the umemployment figures, although those registered as unemployed need the income from, and want, full-time work. That major malfunction shows that the Government's crude method of counting unemployed people and the number of vacancies in the economy is inappropriate and shows a lack of information about what is happening in the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ratio of vacancies to registered unemployed varies massively across the country. Presumably, even Tory Members accept that some of the regions suffer much worse from unemployment that others. Let us consider the figures comparing unemployed claimants to registered full-time vacancies. In the northern region, there are 26 registered unemployed for every vacancy—and I have already made clear that many of those vacancies will not be suitable to the people who are allowed to be registered as unemployed—in Yorkshire and Humberside there are 25 registered unemployed for every registered vacancy, in the north-west it is 24, in Scotland it is 24, in Wales it is 19, in the east midlands it is 18, in the west midlands it is 16, in Greater London it is 12, in the south-west it is 11, in east anglia it is 10 and in the south-east, excluding Greater London, it is 5. That is the variation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The requirement that people should look actively for work makes sense only if there are jobs available. The Government always use the macro figure of 700,000 vacancies. Given that the distribution of vacancies across our economy is so unbalanced, if some adjustment is not made, and we do not take into account the number of vacancies in local labour markets, people will be required to engage in a stupid endless search for jobs that they know that they will not get. That is a terrible thing to do to people who are already short of income because they are unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Studies show that people's confidence is bruised and battered if they are unable to use their skills, because they feel that they are not valuable to society. If they have to apply for jobs and prove that they are applying for jobs every week, those who are turned down repeatedly will be hurt and bruised. It is a mindless activity that is likely to make them angry. They may take short cuts and become deeply cynical about the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the meeting in Birmingham on Friday, people were talking jokingly in the bar about setting up agencies. People could apply to those agencies for jobs and would be guaranteed a reply to every letter. Probably no one will set up such agencies, but it shows the cynical attitude towards fulfilling the Government's mindless, meaningless, unjust and silly requirements. Do the Government want that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>244</span>
I am convinced that there is a clear, rational and intelligent strategy behind the Bill—that is, to force people to take up useless employment training places or very low-paid employment. How crude will the Government be? I raised the point with the Secretary of State on Second Reading. He gave an assurance that some provision would be made in these invisible regulations to ask local officials to take account of the number of vacancies in the local labour market. That takes us back to the problem to which we referred earlier. Ministers are inclined to give us assurances that the regulations will make provisions that will allow officials not to comply with the law of the land, assuming that the Bill is enacted unamended. That seems an odd assurance for Ministers to give.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is intolerable that we are asked to debate and pass legislation without draft regulations. In a previous sitting, the Minister said that it would be extraordinary to let us see the regulations before the legislation was passed. It does not bother me that such a step may be unprecedented. Work must already be going ahead on drafting the regulations. An honourable Government, which meant to stand by some of the commitments that they are making in Committee, would at least supply us with the draft regulations, just as they supply us with notes on clauses. Then we could have a much more intelligent debate on the Bill. It is a very serious matter, and I hope that the Minister will give us firm assurances that some special provision will be made in clause 7 to take into account the vacancies in the local labour market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Bruce</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I appreciate that reading newspapers is out of order in Committee, and I apologise if that is what I seemed to be doing. I seek your guidance as to whether it is in order to look at a newspaper to check whether one's constituency surgery advertisement has gone in. Does that count as reading a newspaper?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Committee is not interested in where or when the hon. Gentleman's constituency surgery is being held. I hope that he can find another time to do his checking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments are slightly different in effect, although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) has outlined so ably, they both refer to conditions in the local labour market. Amendment No. 44 is directed more twoards the market, and amendment No. 52 deals with the ratio of vacancies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On exempting whole areas from the test, at our previous sitting, the Under-Secretary spoke about whether the position would be different if there were no jobs, and whether appropriate steps can be taken because there may be no jobs. Although we accepted that, we questioned his remarks because that was not what the Bill was saying.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has already been made—although only in passing—to experience elsewhere, and I should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>245</span>
like to say a little more about it in the context of local labour market conditions. We have already discussed the position of older workers as a generic group, but the Minister maintained that individual circumstances would be dealt with. In one of our debates, the Minister of State referred to the Australian position. In their briefing for Conservative Bank Bench Members, the Government simply say that two or three other countries make similar provisions, which suggests that there is no problem. Our research suggests that only in Australia is the practice similar. Again there is some doubt about that, but further information is on its way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, as in this country in the 1920s, the way in which the system is working in Australia is causing concern. The 1986 review of the Australian social security system included a paper that dealt with how the seeking work test affected people in their mature years. The paper was entitled, "Too old for a job: too young for a pension?" We have already drawn attention to the conflict between the Department's classification of people who draw occupational pensions as "retired", and the way in which the Bill will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Australian study of how the "work test" currently operates says that its application to older individuals who are unemployed has become a matter for some debate. There are similarities with the Government's proposed test. Every couple of weeks individuals must list what they have done to look for work. They must be registered with the employment service and they must accept any offer of "suitable work." In that respect, the Australian test is clearly more generous than the one that the Government will apply. In this country, it will be irrelevant whether the work is suitable. However, as we are to discuss that matter under clause 9, I shall not dwell on it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The study also says that if it is thought that the person is not looking for work, the question of eligibility for benefit arises, but in Australia long-term beneficiaries aged 55 or over report to the Department only quarterly, and particular conditions apply. Broadly speaking, the position is similar to ours. The long-term unemployed may not have to report as frequently as younger people who have been unemployed for a shorter time. As will be the case here, the seeking work test in Australia has not been relaxed to tie in with the frequency with which people are required to report to the Department. The Australian Minister for Social Security, Brian Howe, says that people are concerned that the seeking work test should be relaxed. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Although it is recognised that older people will do whatever is required of them to retain eligibility for income support, it is felt that the work test is frequently a meaningless administrative hurdle for this group."</p></blockquote>
That is what my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood said a little earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Australian Minister draws attention to the fact that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The general lack of jobs is what makes the testing problematical… First, it means that those who are least employable will be required to continue with a process which is highly likely to be futile and demoralising."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>246</span>
Again, that is precisely what Opposition Members have been saying. It is surprising that when the Department quotes the example of Australia as a country that has the same procedures as the Department here proposes to introduce, it should tell us that they are not likely to be futile and demoralising, although that is very much part of the Australian experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the Australian Minister says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the best method of assessing the genuineness of job seeking is for theCES"—</p></blockquote>
the Department—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to directly offer a job, which is rarely possible. The problems of finding work and work testing are of course by no means confined to older people. Nevertheless, older people do tend to face blanket exclusions from opportunities on a scale faced by few others."</p></blockquote>
He goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is clearly a general reluctance on the part of employers to hire older people."</p></blockquote>
He draws the conclusion that was hinted at earlier in the preceding paragraph, that the community, increasingly, neither expects nor wants older beneficiaries to look for work. There is a complete conflict of the signals being given to people who are often under pressure to accept an early retirement package, particularly when that might save the jobs of younger workers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Australian Minister refers to the traditional requirement in some occupations to retire before pension age and he states that that places "unreasonably conflicting pressures" on older people who are unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister goes on to suggest that since the test is seen, in some circumstances of that kind, to be unreasonable,
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is often felt that it is unproductive to devote … resources to attempts to police it."</p></blockquote>
He then discusses the way in which the system operates elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems not only to confirm our fears about how in practice—whatever the theory may be—such a work test would operate, but to back up our proposition in amendment No. 44. The amendment is designed merely to give substance to the assertion made by the Under-Secretary on Tuesday afternoon to the effect that, whether or not there are jobs and whether or not the steps to be taken are appropriate to the individual, that will make a considerable difference to the steps that people will be required to take and to whether they will be considered still to be actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members are strongly of the view—and, having looked at the record of what the Under-Secretary said, we remain of the view—that the assurances that we have been given do not, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood said earlier, reflect what the Bill actually says. If either of our amendments were accepted—or if effect were to be given to them in some other way, if the precise wording is not acceptable—the Bill, although unacceptable generally, would begin to reflect some of the assurances that have been given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might deal with a couple of detailed
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0160">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>247</span>
points which have arisen during our short debate before I explain why I shall be advising the Committee not to support the amendments. First, if I understood the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) correctly, she suggested that claimants were not allowed to receive unemployment benefit if they were seeking only part-time work. That is not true. If someone is claiming income support, he has to be seeking remunerative work and has, therefore, to be seeking work for 24 hours or more. However, it is perfectly possible for someone to be seeking part-time work and to continue to receive unemployment benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right, of course, and I think that I was wrong to talk about unemployment benefit when I meant income support. But the overwhelming majority of people who have been out of work for any period of time are claiming income support rather than unemployment benefit. That includes some short-term unemployed people; they have been in and out of temporary casual work and therefore have not accumulated unemployment benefit. So it still matters significantly that there is a group of people who cannot be in the figures unless they are looking for full-time work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought it best to clarify the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point, which the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has been discussing, is the international comparison and the Government's claim that the steps that we are advocating in the Bill are reflected elsewhere in the world. I believe that what happens in Australia, Canada and New Zealand is broadly analogous to our proposal. In the United States of America, some states have even tougher proposals than those that we are suggesting. Denmark has recently reviewed its practice and proposes to move much closer to what we are suggesting. Both the mood and the move internationally are in support of what we propose. We are making the proposals not simply because we are slavishly following international practice but because we believe that the Bill, and this clause in particular, is appropriate to the present circumstances in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it is manifest that there are different levels of unemployment and vacancies in different regions but one can see that in every single region, unemployment is now falling. The largest falls in the past year have been in the west midlands, the north-west and Wales, which are all areas that have suffered worse than average levels of unemployment recently. The situation is getting better—that was agreed across the Floor of the Committee the last time we met—and in those circumstances it is right that every possible encouragement should be given to people to get out there and actively seek work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had that discussion with the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) at out last sitting. If there are 3,000 unemployed people in a particular location and only 300 vacancies, the chances of getting one of those vacancies are reduced because of that imbalance, but those vacancies are still there. The amendments appear to suggest that there should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>248</span>
a certain ratio. I do not know how on earth one decides what that ratio should be—it would certainly boggle my mind. The fact that those jobs are available means in my judgment that we should be encouraging people actively to try to get one of those vacancies for themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister quoted one factor in what we said to him about the ratio of some 10:1 in vacancies and the number of unemployed, but we introduced a number of other factors. One example that we gave was of a 59-year-old ex-coal miner. There were no mines within a 60-mile radius and he had been through a long period of having job applications rejected. All those things would have to be taken into account. The Minister replied that that man should be put under pressure actively to seek work under the penalty of losing his benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly believe that even that miner should take appropriate steps to seek work. Those appropriate steps will be, as I shall say in a moment, steps that are appropriate to the local labour market. The Opposition appear to be saying in the amendments, "All right, the situation in the local labour market is difficult. There is an imbalance in the number of people available for work and vacancies. Therefore, you should be able just to ignore the need to take any steps actively to seek work." That is not right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister knows that that is misleading. That is not what we are saying. That is not what the law is and it is not how the law will remain if the Bill is not enacted. We are saying that it is wholly unreasonable to tell somebody that he should continue active job search even when it is perfectly clear that that is likely to be entirely futile and fruitless for that individual. Whether the Minister likes it or not, and I do not suppose that he does, the Under-Secretary strayed into agreeing with us on that point at the last sitting—as he would, because he is a reasonable man, although he bears the burden of being a Government Minister. Now the Minister is required to say something entirely different because that is what the Bill is and that is what the law is, but he cannot wriggle out of it. We are not saying that people do not have to do anything. They have to do things to satisfy the availability for work test now. The issue is whether they should have to engage in a futile search.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady uncharacteristically misrepresented the point that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary was making when we discussed these matters last time. He talked of a case where there were no jobs available at all. We are talking about a situation in which vacancies are available and we want to see that people take active steps to find and fill them. That is good for the economy and the country and it is good for the individuals concerned.

No one denies that work may be more difficult to find in some areas than in others. That is why, when

making judgments in these matters, the employment service will be able to take account of local labour market conditions. The steps that claimants would be expected to take in London and the south-east for example, would be different and more active than those that claimants would be expected to take in other parts of the country where there are fewer vacancies. If in one week a person tries but finds no vacancies for which to apply, he or she will have fulfilled the commitment to have actively sought work in that week, but they will be expected to look the following week to see whether there are new vacancies and to take advantage of any new opportunities that arise. That is reasonable but it would be a bureaucratic nightmare if, as amendment No. 44 proposes, they had to have a reasonable prospect of obtaining suitable employment or if there were some local ratio which would doubtless have to be adjusted from time to time as the number of vacancies in an area rose and fell.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that a person who attends the jobcentre and finds that there are no suitable vacancies has fulfilled the requirement in the Bill, or would he or she have to apply for something knowing that it was useless to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot give a definitive answer to that. In some circumstances that might be deemed to be actively seeking work. In most circumstances, one would expect the claimants to take other steps as well to demonstrate their activity such as looking for vacancies in newspapers and applying for jobs if there are vacancies around.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On Second Reading I asked whether people would be expected to take jobs that would make them worse off. The Minister quite properly replied that, given the Government's tax changes and their new family credit arrangements, he thought that very few, if any, would be worse off, taking into account not just the wage levels, but their benefit entitlement. Can he confirm that people will not be expected to take jobs that will make them worse off even after the tax and benefit changes? Would it be proper for someone to put forward as part of their evidence the fact that they have applied unsuccessfully for jobs and are not prepared to take other jobs that would make themselves and their family worse off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. Gentleman intervened to make that point on Second Reading, I asked him to read carefully what I said. I hope that he has done that. I cannot say that under no circumstances would a person be expected to take a job below the level of benefit that they were receiving out of work. Commissioners' decisions over the years have shown that there can be circumstances in which people might be expected to do that. The numbers would be few. The situation existed under Labour as well as Conservative Governments. There is nothing new in it. I hope that under the tax and benefit changes that
	<span class='label label-info column'>250</span>
have been introduced, particularly if we can gain a much wider spread of take-up for family credit, such a situation will rarely arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When staff advise claimants about jobs will they also help them to work out their housing benefit and family credit entitlement so that they know their position before they move on?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that such advice will be available as a general rule so that people can find out their exact position and also have their attention drawn to the existence of family credit, for example, and the help that that can provide if they are in comparatively low-paid work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If advice is given that draws people's attention to the fact that if they have children they might be entitled to draw family credit, can the Minister assure the Committee that their attention will also be drawn to the way in which having family credit might affect their housing benefit? They might lose free school meals and other such benefits, which affect the calculation of whether they are better or worse off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We would aim, on an accelerated pattern, to show people precisely what their circumstances would be if they accepted a vacancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, even if vacancies are scarce, even if there are fewer vacancies in one area than in another, it should still be incumbent upon individuals who are receiving benefit actively to seek those vacancies and to try to find suitable work. The amendments would undermine the broad thrust of what we are trying to achieve in the clause, which is obviously why they were tabled. I cannot recommend the Committee to accept them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also underline the fact that people have a duty to seek work. One of the real worries of people on benefit is partly the issue that I raised with the Minister, about being better or worse off, but also whether the job will last long. They worry about what will happen to them if they lose that job and return to benefit. That is why the Secretary of State's statement on Second Reading was so important. If I understood him correctly, he talked about a streamlining process for people to sign back on benefit should the job not work out or not last very long. I hope that before we complete the Committee stage of the Bill, the Minister will tell us much more about that. It is an important innovation if what my constituents tell me is true—I am happy to voice their complaints—and would go some way, although not the whole way, to meet our objective, which is set out in our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to the hon. Gentleman's point. It would be more appropriate to discuss that in more detail on the later clause. I reiterate my advice to the Committee to reject the two amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That response was wholly unsatisfactory. It took us no further than did one answer to a quick intervention on Second Reading.

	<span class='label label-info column'>251</span>
That is not good enough. We have been given assurances that people will be treated differently depending on the local levels of unemployment and vacancies but we know nothing more. When the Minister says that it would be intolerable not to apply the provisions of the Bill to areas of high unemployment he talks about the situation before the Bill is enacted in a completely false way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party believes absolutely in the dignity of work and the duty of each member of the community to participate and contribute to that community by working. We believe in working rather than making money out of investments and out of other people's work. That is a profound part of our moral outlook. We believe absolutely in the right of people who cannot work to receive benefits but that they have a duty to work if work is available. The previous benefit system was based on that: people were required to take work if suitable work was available and they could be required to go on training courses if they were not willing to take that work. That is and always has been our view. That was the post-war settlement agreed by both parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this Government, there have been many shifts from that. We have had the introduction of restart and the availability for work questionnaires. Even if the Government accept the amendment, people in poor areas with massive unemployment, where 26 applicants chase every vacancy, will still be subjected to the availability for work questionnaire when they first become unemployed. With the slogan of "placement before payment", the desire will be to get them on a scheme rather than give them their benefit. They will have a restart interview and another long questionnaire six months later. There is the prospect of being called in again in at least another six months, perhaps more frequently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us be clear what we mean by exempting people in areas of high unemployment from the provisions. We are not saying that people should not have to look for work, or should not be required to take work if it is available, but that they should not be required mindlessly to apply for jobs on a weekly basis when those jobs are not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is shocking that the Minister should, for the second time, say barefacedly that people may be required to take work that will pay them less than they are entitled to claim in benefits. Does he really mean that? No one lives in any great comfort on benefits, which have been whittled away, despite the pretence, and whatever the advertising and public relations agencies tell the Government to say. To suggest that someone should work for less than he gets in benefits is intolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that so-called claimant advisers are supposed to assist people to understand all the in-work benefits to which they are entitled. I could accept the Government saying that if people were better off in a job if they claimed all the benefits to which they were entitled, and for which they would have assistance, they would be required to take that job. However, it is intolerable to say that people must take a job that will make them and their families worse off. I hope that the Minister did not mean that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>252</span>
There is already the lunatic scheme of giving six months subsidy of £20 a week to anyone who will take a job paying less than £80 a week. Presumably, it is meant to get people used to low wages, but what are they supposed to do when the £20 a week stops?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure that the Minister has informed the Committee correctly. Some members of the Committee have referred to the decision of the commissioners that availability for work is not a passive state, but involves and requires an active search. Ministers have told us more than once that that decision has been reversed, but they have never given us a reference, and we should like one. Advisers throughout the country are unaware that that decision has been overturned. We have already given the Minister the reference to the commissioners' ruling—it is R(U) 5/80. When was the decision overturned, and what is the reference? Many people outside the House would also like to know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that looking for jobs in a jobcentre might not be enough, and that people should also look in newspapers. At Handsworth technical college, which has many 21-hour students, there is a unit that seeks to give unemployed people training to help them get work. Staff at the unit analysed the vacancies in the local newspaper, and when they took away the jobs selling insurance and encyclopaedias—jobs where people work on commission—the overwhelming majority—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The 	<i>Birmingham Evening Mail</i> has taken on great significance in Parliament, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer occasionally refers to it as evidence that there are jobs available. It seems extraordinary that he does not have more scientific methods of measurement. Analysis of the jobs advertised in the 	<i>Birmingham Evening Mail</i> showed that, after ruling out the encyclopedia and insurance sales vacancies, jobs which do not require specific or high levels of skill are few and far between.

Ministers are misleading us and themselves about the nature of the existing provisions that they are seeking to amend. They are giving the vaguest possible assurances about what will happen to people in areas of very high unemployment. There have been references to 3,000 people being unemployed in the local labour markets. That figure is not realistic, because in my constituency, and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) about 10,000 people are unemployed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful in one sense, because if the Minister continued to talk about 3,000 people,

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a reasonable world, that might be the case. It is a contradiction that although we think the Minister a reasonable man, he belongs to the most intransigent and unreasoanble Administration.

After all, he is not willing to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the Minister remains on the Treasury Bench as part of his belief in actively seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We shall not press the issue to a vote now, but we shall seek to come back to it on Report.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 45, in page 4, line 45, after "he", insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or another person on his behalf.</p></blockquote>
I am grateful to those hon. Members who passed on their good wishes to my father.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 45 was specifically requested by British Actors Equity Association, the union that represents the acting profession. The reasons for that request will commend the amendment to the Minister. I am sure that the Minister will move speedily to rectify what must just be an omission in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If Members of Parliament were forced to join a union, Equity would undoubtedly be the most appropriate. Many of us have kindred links with the union, and I am sure that all members of the Committee agree that this is a sympathetic case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1988, the membership of Equity stood at 41,000. It is well known that at any given moment, the great majority of actors and actresses are not working in the profession. The union estimates that between 60 per cent. and 80 per cent. of actors and actresses are not working in the profession at any one time. Many of them will be unemployed—I believe that they call it "resting". Many others will be doing other jobs, but will be waiting for their great opportunity. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Warley, East
	<span class='label label-info column'>254</span>
(Mr. Faulds) manages to double up as an active member of Equity and an active Member of Parliament. I understand that he earns quite a lucrative sum as a voice-over. We should like to hear his voice in the Chamber from time to time; perhaps we should pay him more to attract him in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that if hon. Members on both sides of the House did not offer their services to act as chat show interviewers, more jobs would be available for Equity members. Of course, given the fees that I understand such hon. Members get, there is a tinge of jealously in my views, although I should prefer to hang on to a junior Front Bench post in the Opposition than take Murdoch's gold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equity has members who are actively seeking work and actors' commitment to their profession is perhaps unlike any other. Our amendment seeks some recognition of the fact that actors and actresses might not necessarily actively seek work on their own behalf, and that that is often done on their behalf by their agents. The amendment applies to theatrical agents employed to seek work on behalf of Equity members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should explain to hon. Members who are not of a thespian bent—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—and my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) should know that that means someone who has a natural urge to act on a stage. As his Whip, I notice that my hon. Friend has come late to this morning's sitting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeremy Corbyn 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Islington, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been performing in another place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will perform in this place later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members should understand that actors' agents are not the same as politicians' agents, although we all appreciate the role that the latter play in ensuring that we are here as Members of Parliament. Actors' agents put actors' and actresses' names forward for auditions, send photographs to casting directors, arrange interviews and seek suitable work on their clients' behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that adjudication officers generally accept that when an Equity member employs an agent, that actor or actress is accepted as actively seeking work because many more job opportunities are available to the actor or actress than would otherwise be the case. That is an accepted practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An agent is critical to the chances of an actor or actress securing work in the profession. Equity members pay quite a lot for an agent's services— between 10 per cent. and 15 per cent. of earnings. I am glad that political agents do not charge similar fees. The agents collect that 10–15 per cent. of earnings for all jobs obtained via their services. Therefore agents have a profit motive to obtain as much work as possible for their clients. No doubt that will appeal to Conservative Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equity members are so keen to continue their work within the profession that some employ more than one agent. Therefore they put in multiple applications all over the place. Fortunately, that is without the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0164">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>255</span>
sad consequences experienced by a previous hon. Member when he put in multiple applications, although those applications were not connected with acting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many good reasons why the amendment should be accepted. Some Equity members employ a personal manager who deals exclusively with attempts to obtain work for that person. There are good reasons for the amendment, and I am sure that the Minister will rush to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the next speaker, may I associate myself with those hon. Members who have expressed good wishes for the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), to pass on to his father. I hope that he makes a speedy recovery. The hon. Gentleman had his priorities right in absenting himself from the Committee on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also add—perhaps as one with thespian tendencies—that I was under the impression that the hon. Member for Newham, North-West was acting as agent for the hon. Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add my good wishes, and those on this side of the Committee, for the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) to pass on to his father. We wish him a speedy recovery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman hoped, I rush towards him on the amendment, but I must disappoint him by stopping before I reach him. I may have thespian interests, but not being bent, I have to pause before I arrive at the stance that the hon. Gentleman would like me to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in clarifying our intentions further, I can reassure the hon. Gentleman, the acting profession and Equity in particular, on whose behalf he spoke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have already said, the regulation-making power is an essential part of the clause and we envisage that the regulations, in providing for the steps to be taken to show active job search will say that a claimant must take all appropriate steps. What those steps are will, by definition, vary from claimant to claimant, and indeed, from week to week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they are to be sensitive to the individual and the local labour market at the beginning of a period of unemployment, the steps must vary, according to the job area sector in which the individual is interested. The sort of steps that we envisage claimants taking are the sort that have been mentioned earlier— contacting employers, answering advertisements, registering with employment agencies, attending the jobcentre, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A claimant, I repeat, will have to take all appropriate steps. The regulations will show that. There is nothing to stop a claimant asking an agent or agency, or a friend, or a manager, his trade union, or other groups or individuals to help him—indeed he should do so, if appropriate. In some fields of employment, if the only way of getting a job is by
	<span class='label label-info column'>256</span>
registering with a specialised agency, that one step would be enough. But that will not be often. The Government do not concede that the responsibility for active job search can be passed over in law to some other individual body or group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not know what proof the regulations will require, but will it satisfy the authorities if actors or actresses can say that agent X or Y is looking for work on their behalf? Acting is a different occupation from most. Most actors and actresses need to employ agents to seek work for them. Will the Minister give an assurance that any actors or actresses giving proof of the agents working on their behalf will meet the requirements of the regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the hon. Gentleman's point, and I have a lot of sympathy for it. I shall not give him an absolute assurance now, although we shall consider the matter carefully to see how usefully we can specify it in the regulations. The hon. Gentleman said that many actors register with several agencies, because that gives them a better chance of securing work. So I cannot agree to write into the Bill that it is sufficient to register with a single agency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the hon. Gentleman's point and shall bear it in mind when drawing up the regulations. Adjudication officers understand that the main way to secure a job in the acting profession is through an agency, but we are unwilling to write into the Bill that the responsibility for actively seeking work can be transferred to another individual or group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said enough to assure the hon. Gentleman that I take his point seriously. I believe that it is already met in the Bill, and we shall pay particular attention to it when the regulations are being drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for his comments. It was worth moving the amendment to draw the problem to his attention. I accept his assurance that he will take care when drafting the regulations; I, too, will look carefully at the regulations that he drafts, to ensure that the point has been met.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment could have said "another person or persons", as that would have made it even more specific. I have explained why actors and actresses may wish to employ more than one agent, just as people may wish to offer their house for sale through more than one estate agent. If it is a property that is likely to sell quickly, it pays to let just one agency deal with it. The same applies to actors and actresses: the better known the person, the less need there is to employ more agents. However, that is a technical point. I accept what the Minister says, as he obviously takes the point seriously.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complex group of amendments. Amendment No. 59 is intended to act as a paving amendment for amendment No. 60,
	<span class='label label-info column'>258</span>
which adds four new subsections to section 17 of the 1975 Act. The new subsections are meant to ensure that, where a question arises about whether a person is actively seeking work, unemployment payments continue unless and until an adjudication officer decides that the person is not actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An analogous situation can occur under the existing rules if a question arises about whether an unemployed person is available for work. Until about a year ago, unemployment benefit and supplementary benefit could be suspended on suspicion of non-availability, and the claimant could be left penniless while the case was referred to an adjudication officer. If the adjudication decided, in due course, in the claimant's favour, arrears were paid. But that frequently took a long time and, meanwhile, the claimant, although available for work, had to manage without income or, at best, with an urgent needs payment if no other source of help was available to prevent him from sinking into debt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following a tragic case in Bristol in which Ms Rachel Caine committed suicide after her benefit was withdrawn under those rules, a change of policy was made. It is worth examining the details of that sad case. The Department of Employment sent a letter to the hon. Member for Bristol, South (Ms Primarolo), who had taken up the case, and the chilling details that it reveals are instructive. It said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the sequence of events was as follows:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(1) Ms Caine attended the Yate part-time Unemployment Benefit Office on 29 September and completed the usual benefit claim forms and the standard availability for work questionnaire.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(2) A normal supervisory check of these documents at the main Yate office raised a question as to whether the information which Ms Caine had given regarding the work she was looking for and the wages she was seeking restricted the extent to which she was available for work.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) In accordance with standard procedures payment of unemployment benefit was suspended at this stage pending the outcome of an assessment of Ms Caine's employment prospects by the Jobcentre and then a decision on her entitlement to benefit by an independent Adjudication Officer. The Benefit Office obtained the assessment and referred the case to the Adjudication Officer for a decision within 5 working days of her making her claim on 29 September. Also in accordance with normal procedures where a doubt about a claimant's availability for work arises payment of supplementary allowance was suspended by DHSS who notified Ms Caine separately by letter."</p></blockquote>
That was, sadly, a significant letter for Ms Caine.
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) Ms Caine's death was not learned of by the Department until 2 November. During this time the Adjudication Officer had written to Ms Caine to obtain further information required before a decision on entitlement could be reached.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(5) The Adjudication Officer, when made aware of the situation, made a decision not to disallow Ms Caine's benefit claim because it was of course not possible or appropriate to investigate further the question of her availability for work. It is unfortunate"—</p></blockquote>
that is a masterly understatement—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that a letter notifying the decision was then addressed to Ms Caine"—</p></blockquote>
who was by then the late Ms Caine.
	<br><blockquote><p>"I can understand that this letter together with an earlier one sent on 4 November must have caused considerable and unnecessary distress to her family and I can only apologise unreservedly for that fact."</p></blockquote>
It is right that we should consider cases like Ms Caine's. The responsibility for making decisions
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0166">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>259</span>
should be shared by Members of Parliament who legislate in committees such as this and by the officers who must carry the burden. Sadly, cases like Ms Caine's are not isolated, and varying degrees of suffering, distress and pain are caused by decisions that the Department of Health and Social Security sometimes makes with the best will in the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The officer, Mr. John Lee, who wrote the letter goes on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I hope that is clear from this summary of events that the UBO in fact acted promptly in referring Ms Caine's claim to the independent adjudicating authorities. The delays which then occurred are attributable in large part to the fact that her death did not become known to the Department for almost a month"—</p></blockquote>
that is not surprising.
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, with the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that there are aspects of Ms Caine's claim which could have been handled differently.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Department has taken note of these points. It has already acted to ensure that its revised instructions to staff include specific guidance to interview claimants who appear anxious about their availability position or about financial hardship resulting from the suspension procedure."</p></blockquote>
It seems rather unfair that, again, responsibility for deciding those matters is on the shoulders of the poor Indians and is not built into regulations. By passing on that responsibility, we are also passing on the guilt when those terrible events occur. The letter continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In addition you will probably be aware that—although introduced in a different context—we have recently announced a change in our policy as regards the suspension of benefit in cases where it is already in payment. The position now is that where a question arises about a person's availability for work, supplementary benefit is not suspended unless and until an Adjudication Officer decides that the person concerned is not entitled to benefit.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Finally, officials are currently reviewing the guidance to staff on the action to take in the event of a claimant's death to ensure that in future they act with greater sensitivity."</p></blockquote>
We have no quarrel with the letter's conclusion and accept the spirit in which it is written. No blame can be placed on the officers involved for what happened in those circumstances, although once they responded, Ms Caine was past all help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, it was decided that supplementary benefit should not be suspended until a formal decision is made by an adjudication officer. Will the Minister confirm that that applies to income support now that it has replaced supplementary benefit? It is now an even more essential safeguard, given that urgent need payments were thrown out with the supplementary benefit bathwater last April.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, a new regulation came into force on 2 May 1988, under which unemployment benefit also remains payable pending a formal decision on availability and is no longer withdrawn as soon as the suspicion of non-availability arises. The Minister will have realised at once that amendment No. 60 reproduces most of that regulation almost word for word, which explains why the drafting is not up to our usual standard. As we go through our amendments, it will become clear that those which are the result of the creativity of Opposition Members and our advisers will be jewels in the statute book. Some of
	<span class='label label-info column'>260</span>
them could be said to be iambic pentameters or, in Welsh, cynghanedd, and they will shine as models of literary achievement. The same cannot be said for some amendments, but we do not take responsibility for the Government's standard of drafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main difference between the regulation and amendment No. 60 is that the regulation deals with availability, while the amendment deals with the "actively seeking employment" provision. The amendment's effect would be that unless the claimant had actually stated that he had no intention of actively seeking employment, his unemployment benefit would continue until the adjudication officer had decided that he was not actively seeking employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government's intentions as set out in the original note on clause 7 had remained unaltered, the amendment would not be necessary. The note said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The power to deem a claimant to be actively seeking work will be used… in the course of a claim, where a doubt has arisen about the claimant's job search but the question has yet to be decided by the adjudicating authorities. This will allow any benefit in payment to continue pending decision."</p></blockquote>
The Ministers' letter—a literary atrocity that has now been corrected—dated 23 January to members of the Committee took a different line. It was sabotaged by a manic word processor that was so seriously deranged that it managed to alter the word "test" to "but" and inserted several words of its own creation. Clearly, it is a very sick word processor. Although we took some time to fathom the meaning of that semi-literate version of the letter, we are still concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We discussed that strange letter on Monday and decided that any lines or words missing would probably be in later regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might have been on Tuesday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to know that the source of many of the ideas in the clause has been identified—they come from the mind of a word processor. However, we are suspicious that a human being devised many of the concepts in the clause. If we can blame a machine for creating the law, that puts a different complexion on the matter. It means that we are being driven by the mind of a machine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is not the fault of a machine but the inspiration of 	<i>Hansard.</i> Last week, I described the clause as "onerous", but I read in 	<i>Hansard</i> this morning that I described the clause as "oderous". I shall settle with the corrected version.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the machine that is writing the Government's letters is clearly showing its opposition. It writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We have decided that there will be no need to use the power for the situation where a doubt about a claimant's job search activity arises during the course of a claim … Only in the rare cases where a claimant states clearly that he has no intention of taking any steps to find employment will any question arise to be put to the AO about his entitlement to benefit… in other cases, if the claimant fails to take the action which the employment service staff recommended at the start of his claim that he should, the issue will again be discussed with him. They will go over with him what courses of action might be fruitful, given the state of the local job market and his personal situation, reminding him of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>261</span>
the need to satisfy the 'actively seeking employment test' if he is to continue to receive benefit (or be credited with contributions). Only if, after that, the claimant continues to fail to take such action will his benefit be stopped, and the adjudication officer asked for a decision. The claimant will thus have been specifically reminded of what constituted 'actively seeking employment' and will have been given an opportunity to take appropriate action, before the question of whether he fails to satisfy the test arises to be put to the adjudication officer."</p></blockquote>
On the surface the letter seems very reasonable when it is made intelligible. There seems little to worry about even if we cannot be reconciled with the requirement that the claimant should actively seek employment every week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have two fundamental objections. First, the procedure, as described by the Minister, rests on a number of assumptions. It is assumed that the claimant will have received some helpful recommendations from the employment service, that his alleged failure to follow the recommendations will have been discussed with him and that further suggestions will have been made taking into account the local job market and his personal situation. He would have been reminded of what constitutes actively seeking employment and given another opportunity to take appropriate action. There is no guarantee that all those steps will have been taken. It needs only one case where benefit is suspended without going through those procedures and the Minister will have to express his sincere but profound regret at yet another suicide and regulations will be rushed through to prevent such a tragedy recurring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our second objection is even more fundamental. The assumption underlying the Minister's letter of 23 January is that the adjudication officer will in due course decide that the claimant was not actively seeking employment. What if the decision goes in the claimant's favour, as is often the case? The Minister may think it improbable, but the latest figures show that 51.3 per cent. of the cases referred to adjudication officers concerning doubt about availability are decided in the claimant's favour. Where it is a question of restricted availability, more than three quarters—77.6 per cent.—are decided in the claimant's favour. Even if only a quarter of the cases referred to the adjudication officer under the actively seeking employment conditions are resolved in favour of the claimant, in every one of those cases an innocent person will have been penalised for an offence that he or she did not commit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 seeks the insertion of the following subsection:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(1A) Where a person has made and is pursuing an appeal against the determination of an adjudication officer that he is or was not actively seeking employment, he shall not be required to be or, as the case may be, to have been actively seeking employment pending the determination of his appeal."</p></blockquote>
The effect would be that if an adjudication officer decided that a person was not actively seeking work and that person appealed to a social security appeals tribunal the actively seeking work provision would be suspended until the appeal had been heard. That is a reasonable request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The course of events under clause 7 as it stands would be as follows. First, benefit would be suspended as from the date where a suspicion about actively seeking work arises. Secondly, the
	<span class='label label-info column'>262</span>
adjudication officer would decide that the person was not actively seeking work. The suspension would become a disqualification and would continue indefinitely until the circumstances changed or the person appealed. Thirdly, if the person appealed, even if the appeal was successful, no benefit would be paid for at least three or four weeks and probably longer between the lodging of the appeal and the tribunal hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even after the appeal tribunal has decided in the claimant's favour, it can take two or three weeks before the local DSS office is notified of the tribunal's decision and puts it into effect. The officials do their best to apply the test fairly. A claimant who actively seeks work may well be deprived of both unemployed benefit and income support for two or three months—longer in areas where there is a backlog of appeals. All hon. Members are familiar with these tortuous appeals and know of the consequences of delays for the claimants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will doubtless clarify whether someone in that situation will be entitled to income support at 60 per cent. of normal minimum rates on grounds of hardship. Under the present rules, the reduced rates for payments are available to a person who is not considered to be available for employment but only if the adjudication officer is satisfied that hardship would otherwise result. We do not know whether that provision is to be extended to people who are not regarded as actively seeking work. Even if it is, living for several months on an income 40 per cent. below the normal income support level is a massive penalty. The income support level itself could hardly be described as generous. The penalty for being wrongly suspected of not actively seeking work will be penury and starvation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39. would prevent that crude injustice. It would not, as Ministers will doubtless suggest, open the floodgates to massive abuse because the test of availability for work would apply precisely as it does now. It will simply mean that the additional test of actively seeking work would not apply where a decision was under appeal. It would involve relatively few cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 53 seeks to insert the following subsection:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4A) Where an appeal has been made to a social security appeal tribunal against a determination that a person is or was not actively seeking employment, arrangements shall be made to ensure that, so far as practicable, the appeal is heard within 21 days of its being made.".</p></blockquote>
If amendment No. 39 is accepted, the need to impose a time limit for the hearing of appeals against "not actively seeking employment" decisions will be less compelling. If amendment No. 39 is not accepted, it will be extremely important to ensure that people are not left without benefit for months while the wheels of the DSS administration and the wheels of justice grind slowly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average delay in getting appeals heard now is about four months despite the dramatic fall in the number of appeals in recent months. The president of the social security appeals tribunal, Judge Byrt has laid down a general rule that appeals received in the local DSS office should be forwarded to the tribunals
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0168">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>263</span>
clerk within 15 days. The clerk then has to arrange the hearing giving the parties at least 10 days' notice. The time limit proposed in the amendment assumes that local offices would submit "actively seeking work" appeals to the clerk in less than the prescribed 15 days and that the clerk would arrange the hearing without delay. That is very different from what happens now. The last report of the chief adjudication officer for 1986–87 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I regret… that the delays in sending submissions to SSATs have got worse. The average clearance times of submissions to SSATs were 22 working days for supplementary benefit appeals (compared with 18 last year) and 26 days for other benefits appeals (compared with 20 last year). The proportions cleared to tribunals within the requisite 15 days were just over and just under half respectively."</p></blockquote>
We do not have more recent figures, but we understand that the target set by the DSS for its local offices is not even the 15 days demanded by the president, but 32 days, or four and a half weeks. Obviously, even that unambitious target is not being met in individual cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are further delays between the submission of the paper to the tribunal clerk and the appeal hearing. The chief adjudication officer is not responsible for that part of the system, nor is the Minister, since the tribunal falls within the Lord Chancellor's jurisdiction. Will the Minister say what is the average total delay between lodging an appeal and the tribunal hearing? If the answer is more than 21 days, what does he consider to be a realistic target? Amendment No. 53 is clearly necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 70 seeks to strengthen and amend the Bill in a similar area. Under the existing arrangements, an unemployed person may apply at the unemployment benefit office, on form UB674, for permission to go away from home without loss of entitlement, provided that he or she remains available for work. There is no requirement to seek work actively while away, and absence is limited to a maximum of a fortnight. D. Bonner's "Non-Means-Tested Benefits Legislation" says—and I am not responsible for the grammatical error in this quotation—that there are three main principles.
	<br><blockquote><p>"A claimant who goes on a holiday can, generally still be regarded as able to accept offers if he can be readily contacted, would be willing and able to cut short his holiday to accept employment and can show that there is nothing to prevent him accepting such a suitable employment as might be notified."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members will notice the misuse of the gerund in that last sentence. We should start some educational intiative for report writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The three principles have been expanded into a five-point test in the current adjudication officers' guide. Existing rules rely on the decisions of commissioners on those actively seeking work. Those decisions follow the tradition of the umpires of the 1930s, about which we have heard much. The administration of the going-away-from-home forms was criticised in the 1980 Rayner scrutiny which recommended that
	<br><blockquote><p>"all unemployed"—</p></blockquote>
oh, brave new world, here it comes—
	<span class='label label-info column'>264</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"should be entitled to two weeks holiday per year without the requirement to be available for work."</p></blockquote>
We are creating a wonderful future. The unemployed can have two weeks without being harassed by the DSS. Of course, the absence may not be outside Britain, except that unemployed income support claimants continue to receive income support for four weeks if a claimant is temporarily absent in Northern Ireland. An unemployment benefit if temporarily absent in either Northern Ireland or the Isle of Man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause is not amended it will have unfortunate consequences. It used to be said that the Government's mass unemploymnent is a return to the 1930s. We have explained at length that it is a return to beyond the 1930s—back to the 1920s. The amendment is designed to test that assertion, because even in the 1930s the unemployed might be allowed benefit during absences, so long as they remained available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unemployed depend on form UB674 and the system, not only for short holidays in Britain—why should the unemployed not be allowed a fortnight's holiday each year?—but for other absences: for example, visiting sick or terminally ill relatives, or attending family weddings or funerals. It would be a petty and mean act against the long term unemployed if absences were to mean loss of benefit and the requirement to make a new claim. Does the Minister agree that the existing arrangement should continue in clause 7? He should accept the amendment to exempt the unemployed from actively seeking work in every single week of unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as we understand the notes on clauses, the Government have no present intention of using the power to deem a person to be actively seeking work for purposes such as those that I have outlined. But we seek a power in the Bill to exempt the unemployed from the requirement in such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our concern is that we have been asked to accept a clause, although its operation has not been described to us. We have had a thespian morning, so I shall quote from King Lear who, at a time of difficulty, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will do such things—What they are yet I know not—but they shall be The terrors of the earth."</p></blockquote>
Is the Minister saying, "I shall do such things, what they are yet I know not, but regulations may explain, but they shall be the terrors of the unemployed."?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for clarification, and so that there is no mistake in the mind of the Committee, amendment No. 71 is being taken later and separately and will come after amendment No. 49, with which we shall take amendment No. 51.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments relate to the point at which people are to be deprived of their benefits, if it is to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0169">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>265</span>
be by an adjudication officer and if they are to have right of appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The original notes on clauses, in explaining the use of the regulations making power under subsection (2) said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The power to deem a claimant to be actively seeking work will be used at the start of a claim for unemployment benefit, when a claimant may not have been able to take steps to find work, or, in the course of a claim, where a doubt has arisen about the claimant's job search but the question has yet to be decided by the adjudicating authorities."</p></blockquote>
We then had a letter from the Minister, deleting that part. That is serious. I served on the Committee which considered the Employment Act 1988. During that Committee, as a consequence of the terrible case outlined by my hon. Friend, and a number of other cases where people's availability for work had been questioned and their benefit immediately removed before the case had gone to the adjudication officer, the Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Employment announced that, if someone's availability was being questioned, their benefit would not be removed until the case had gone to an adjudication officer. That decision was released to the press and everyone was pleased. Is that undertaking being removed by a change in the notes on clauses? Is that how the Government are now operating? We should be told if that decision is being rescinded. It should be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a massive difference between the number of people whose benefit is questioned because of their availability and the numbers that are allowed after their cases have been to an adjudication officer. The figures were quoted earlier, and have increased greatly since 1983, but they are important. In 1987, 171,515 people had their cases referred because of doubt about their availability, and only 85,319 were disallowed benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister please tell us clearly why the notes on clauses were changed, whether the undertaking given by the Under-Secretary in the previous Employment Bill Committee is being rescinded, and what the Government's intentions are?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify our intentions about these very important issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not regard it as necessary for active job search to be deemed pending an adjudication officer's decision when a doubt arises and benefit has paid. I shall explain why in some detail, but before I do so I should like to clear up a point raised by the hon. Member for Ladywood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The undertaking given by the Under-Secretary of State for Employment concerned availability. Nothing in the Bill changes procedures for handling judgments about people's availability. The clause deals with the way in which "actively seeking work" will be handled. Let me explain the difference. "Availability" is a judgment about a current—in the sense of prospective or future—state of availability for employment. "Actively seeking work" is based on evidence which will be produced by the claimant in respect of activity that he or she has undertaken
	<span class='label label-info column'>266</span>
over the previous weeks. So a judgment will not be made on the current situation, but on what has been happening over the previous two weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very important point, although I do not want to interrupt the Minister's flow. In my closing remarks on the previous amendment, I asked the Minister for the reference to when the commissioner's ruling—that being available was an active state—was superseded. I wanted to remind him about that question because, even if he cannot tell us now, it is a very serious matter which is relevant to his point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I say, these are important, complicated matters, and I should like to tell the Committee exactly how they will be handled. After that, we can continue the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing fishy about the proposal. I believe that it flows from my explanation about the difference in the way that the conditions of "availability" and "actively seeking work" will be handled. I hope that by the time I have finished my explanation, I shall have persuaded Opposition Members that in reality they have very little to worry about, although I am not unduly optimistic about doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start by being lured down the path suggested by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) in his closing remarks. When I went back to my school for an old boys' dinner on one occasion, one of my former classmates recalled in his speech my dramatic performance as Lady Macbeth in the school play. He said that he had no doubt that my delivery of the phrase "Give me the dagger" meant that I was bound for a political career.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister also remember the scene where Lady Macbeth has the greatest difficulty in getting rid of some imaginary blood from her hands?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should not have taken that path.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall continue my explanation about how the condition "actively seeking work" will be handled. When a person first becomes unemployed and goes into a benefit office to table his claim, his circumstances and job prospects will be fully discussed with him. If possible, he will be offered a job there and then. If not, he can then claim benefit. His responsibilities, including the fact that he will have to take all appropriate steps to find work, will be explained to him verbally and by leaflet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not envisage that this discussion and test will take place every time that the claimant comes in to sign on. But if, later on, it is thought that the claimant may not be doing enough to satisfy the actively seeking employment condition, the matter will be discussed with him again. He will be advised on what future action might be effective and reminded that he must take all appropriate steps to find work. Unless the claimant comes right out and says that he is not seeking work actively and does not intend to do so, he has the opportunity thereafter to show that he is satisfying the condition. Anyone
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>267</span>
who makes a clear statement that he is not actively seeking employment will not, of course, receive benefit, and his case will be put to the adjudication officer. However, for the overwhelming majority of claimants, benefit will continue at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke of a claimant admitting that he was not actually seeking work. Will the Minister assure the Committee that only when a claimant says in so many words, "I am not actively looking for work" will that be considered in quite the way that the Minister suggested, as opposed to the officer concerned deciding to read that meaning into what the claimant says?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The claimant would have to state it quite clearly. The Committee may feel that it is highly unlikely that someone would make such a statement, bearing in mind the consequences. If someone clearly said that, he would be disqualifying himself from receiving benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a claimant was told that he needed more advice about how to fulfil the condition for actively seeking work, and if he then failed to take appropriate steps, the question of entitlement to benefit for the doubtful weeks would arise. The weeks in question would normally be the two preceding weeks—that is, the period since he last received benefit. The question of title for those two weeks would be put to the adjudication officer, and benefit would not be paid for those weeks pending the adjudication officer's decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the worry expressed by the hon. Member for Newport, West about the law's delay in hearing appeals. However, it should not be taken for granted that no benefit would be paid while the claimant was waiting for the appeal to be heard. There would be nothing to stop a claimant then taking the appropriate steps to seek work actively and returning with a fresh claim in due course. It is up to the claimant to take those steps and in my view, that would be the most likely outcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would help me, and it might also help the Committee, if I put on record a clear statement on the situation, after which we can debate it in detail.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall forget otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If someone loses benefit, the matter will have to be referred to the adjudication officer, after a clerk has made that decision and taken away someone's livelihood. If that person goes off and comes back next day, fulfilling all the conditions laid down by the clerk who has stopped the benefit, will benefit be restored immediately?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He would immediately qualify for benefit. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> He would have lost benefit by that decision for those two weeks. He could then
	<span class='label label-info column'>268</span>
qualify again and claim benefit after a fortnight. I hope that that is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is only too clear. Does not the Minister accept that that is unreasonable? The aim of the procedure is to encourage people to seek work actively, not to punish them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely any Administration who persuaded someone to seek work actively would change the procedure whereby people who had not even registered a claim picked up benefit immediately. New administrative machinery should be devised to allow that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, the hon. Gentleman should remember what I said earlier about the advice and counselling that claimants will be given on at least one occasion before the decision that results in disentitlement from benefit for the two preceding weeks is taken. A lot of advice, guidance and encouragement will be given before that stage. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Member for Ladywood wants to intervene again, will she stand up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask members of the Committee not to indulge in sedentary interruptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although we shall have a power under regulations to deem, we envisage using it not in those circumstances but in circumstances where, for example, part-time firemen and lifeboatmen are engaged in those duties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, the hardship provisions would continue to exist. That is, income support regulations would include a power to allow claimants to receive a reduced rate of income support for weeks when the new test is not satisfied if the claimant was able to satisfy the adjudication officer that he or a member of his family would suffer hardship. That is the current practice with availibility and we propose to carry it forward with the "actively seeking work" test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How long would it take to activate that aspect of the guarantee, because the claimant does not deal with the adjudication officer? Let us suppose that there is real hardship that would allow someone to qualify. How many days would it take for the payment to come through?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The decision could be made on the same day, I think. If the benefit is to be withdrawn, the facility would be given for the claimant to discuss his income support entitlement and the decision could be made that day. I hope that that would be so in the overwhelming majority of cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that part of the procedure will work so well, why will the Minister not meet us on the other point that sometimes, against some people, one may have to apply the sanction? Once the sanction has worked, why is benefit not restored immediately?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because, as I say, the judgment is about the behaviour over the preceding week or weeks. If the judgment were made that the claimant had not satisfied the test in those weeks, he would not have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>269</span>
title to the benefit. But of course, as I say, he can quickly requalify for it and go back on to benefit while the appeal for the money for those two weeks is being considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The aim of the measure is not retribution but to change behaviour. Therefore, once behaviour has been changed, surely the Government ought to meet that claimant's needs by restoring benefit immediately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the whole thrust of the measure is to change people's behaviour, not to punish them. That is the reason for the advice, guidance and encouragement and for the full explanation that is given to the claimant that if he does not take appropriate steps he will put his benefit at risk. I hope that the vast majority of sensible claimants will respond to that and will not have their benefit withdrawn. That is certainly the whole thrust of the procedures that I have sought to outline to the Committee and that is what our aim is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To refresh my memory of something that the Minister may already have covered, am I right in thinking that the decision about the suspension may not be taken by the adjudication officer, and that that will still apply in the circumstances that the Minister has outlined? The initial doubt and the suspension may happen before a formal decision is made to stop benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 39 purports to allow somebody whose benefit had been stopped to continue to receive benefit until the appeal is settled. I believe that we can trust those who will adjudicate on those matters and take those decisions to operate them fairly and sensibly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 70 proposes that claimants should have a holiday from actively seeking work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain how the notes on clauses came to be changed? It was clearly the intention of his Department when the Bill was drafted and the notes on clauses were prepared that when the question arose as to whether someone was actively seeking work, that person would continue to be allowed to have benefit and would have to be deemed to be actively seeking work in order to continue to have benefit until the case had been to the adjudication officer. What has happened? What has changed? Why has that change been brought about? Also, given what we know about the mistaken decisions on availability by the adjudication officer, and the very high level of changed decisions, which Civil Service grade will make those decisions? The Minister cannot tell us exactly what "actively seeking work" will mean in different areas of the country. For a 59-year-old miner it will depend on how high the level of unemployment is. Some junior civil servant is going to make a decision that will deprive people of their money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously I did not make myself clear. In my opening remarks I sought to explain to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>270</span>
Committee the difference between determining availability, which is a current and potential state in the employment market, and the "actively seeking work" test, which is based on evidence of steps that were or were not taken over the preceding week or weeks. That difference is the reason why the deeming provision is not in my view appropriate. Instead of that power, the administrative steps that I have outlined that will be taken to apply the test will be a better and more effective way than the deeming, which would be inappropriate, since we shall be dealing with a real situation which will have arisen over the previous week or two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that one should simply and bluntly say to the Minister that that bears all the hallmarks of an extremely clever explanation that has been devised to show why the Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Employment has not had his assurances of last year completely vitiated. It bears no relationship whatsoever to the reality of the situation. I am certain that the question of my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood about why the decision was taken is pertinent, and it has not been answered by the Minister's explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat that that was the basis upon which the change was made. That is why I sought to write to Committee members explaining to them the new steps that we intend to take, and why I have taken a great deal of time and trouble this morning in seeking to set out the administrative steps that we shall take to encourage people to fulfil the "actively seeking work" test.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has not answered the second part of my question—he has not answered the first part, either—which was, at what level of the Civil Service will the decision be made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be taken at executive officer level—in effect, the first level of management in the Civil Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 70. At present, a claimant can get his benefit while he is away from home if he is still available for work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to complete the explanation; then we can discuss it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Provided there is no contrary evidence, a claimant can satisfy the availability requirement by leaving an address where he can be contacted immediately if a job offer arises and by declaring his intention to return home immediately to attend a job interview or take up a job. That is an administrative arrangement, taken up in some 500,000 cases a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will, of course, by definition be harder for a claimant to show he is actively seeking work if he is away from home. But that does not mean that he should regard a holiday as a break from looking for work. We think it right that people who are unemployed and in receipt of benefit should be making every effort to return to employment. That
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0172">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>271</span>
means more—and it will mean more in future, if this clause reaches the statute book—than just being available. The claimant must be taking whatever steps are appropriate to find work. Regulations will indicate what kind of steps are appropriate and leave flexibility for the appropriate extent of job search at any time to be determined in relation to each individual claimant. There will be occasions when the job situation in relation to a particular individual is such that there will be nothing he can usefully do. He will, obviously, not then be expected to take fruitless action. What he has to do is to take appropriate steps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is different from exempting a person totally from looking for work in certain weeks because he is away from home. Being away from home does not necessarily mean that a person is unable to continue to take steps and to continue his job search. Indeed, many people go away from home in order to look for work. The amendment would cause them to be deemed to be doing so, which is both unnecessary and nonsensical. A provision which would give people the right to suspend their job search when away from home, no matter what the circumstances, could mean that they would miss out on job opportunities and thus remain unemployed and on benefit for longer than they should.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister draw breath?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reach the end. I have been generous in giving way. However, I shall give way again to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for stopping and for drawing breath during his lengthy explanation. I must say that it does not satisfy me or fill me with confidence in the system. Indeed, the longer he goes on, the more alarmed I become. The intervention that I was trying to make was on the question of who will be making the decision to withhold benefit. It seems that it will be made by a civil servant at a very low level. Is the Minister really happy that a decision which is of momentous importance to the claimant—to that person out of work—should be made by somebody who is quite a long way down the scale in the Civil Service pecking order? Does he not think that a decision of such importance should be taken at higher management level within the office concerned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The important point about the people making the decision is the training, guidance and experience that they bring to bear in making judgments. The employment service will ensure that those people have that guidance, training and experience. That is the right way to tackle the issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister. I want to ask him about a different point, which is whether people who are now able to be away and who are considered as available for work will still be able to be away and to be considered as having satisfied the "actively seeking work" condition. The Minister has
	<span class='label label-info column'>272</span>
talked about it only in the context of holiday, and I know that that was the main point that my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West made. The Minister appeared to imply that the Department accepts that unemployed people may be allowed to have some respite from actively seeking work in every week of the year, but not a complete respite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Minister that my hon. Friend also drew his attention to the fact that it might not only be a matter of whether someone is allowed to take a holiday—although Opposition Members would argue, and even Lord Rayner agreed, that unemployed people might be allowed to enjoy a brief holiday. There might also be family illness, family engagements and so on. It seems to me that the impact of what the Minister is saying is that it will be up to some comparatively junior civil servant to decide whether someone is to be allowed to attend a family wedding, or attend at the bedside of a sick relative—as my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) has just done—or go to a funeral. I am sorry to say that I can readily envisage a situation in which someone says, "You're always coming in here saying that your father's ill. He was ill six weeks ago and he was ill four weeks ago. No, I am not prepared to let you go. Why should I? You will lose your benefit if you go." That is absolutely horrendous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When a person has in the past taken active steps to seek work in a week, I find it difficult to understand how leave to attend a funeral will in any way undermine his entitlement to benefit. It seems to me to be totally not in accord with common sense to advance that argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a lot of relatives in Northern Ireland, as the Minister knows. My father's brothers and sisters are growing old. From time to time one of them dies and I go over for the funeral; my mother or somebody else comes with me. The normal thing is to spend a few days there and to visit the other relatives. I think that I should be entitled to do that if I were unemployed. What the Minister has just read out suggests that while I was there I would have to actively seek work, or my benefit for that week could be taken away. That is what we are talking about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Frankly, it would have been better if I had continued to the end of the explanation, because it might have helped to set the hon. Lady's mind at rest. I do not wish to be accused of suggesting that unemployed people should not take holidays or go on visits across the water. But the steps that they take should not have the effect of cutting them off from seeking possible job opportunities. After all, there is a mail system in this country. People can continue to keep in touch with the job situation either through newspapers or through writing letters, despite the fact that they may be away from their homes for a period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the argument that it is a complicated matter. It will be possible for us to deal with a number of the worries that have been raised in Committee—not the fundamental one but the tangential ones—when we come to the regulations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>273</span>
that will implement the clause. Before we reach that stage I shall have discussions with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment and work out a fair, reasonable and workable solution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the hon. Lady's wish, which she has expressed on more than one occasion, to see the regulations. The regulations have not yet been drafted. As we go through the clauses, we shall turn our mind to them, and we shall take into account some of the points that have been made in Committee when we draw them up. This is a difficult and complicated matter and we want to be fair. We want a workable scheme. The best way to handle that will be through the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister sat down?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not totally oblivious to that fact. I was trying to attract the Minister's attention and I thought he said that he wanted to finish the explanation. Perhaps he has. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) I am more concerned after the Minister's so-called explanation than I was at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we expressed concern about the grade of civil servant, it was not because we wanted to disparage the hard working executive officer within the Civil Service. A number of us have enjoyed that position in the past. I finished up at the noble rank of assistant secretary, so my progress was fairly rapid and fully justified. My point is that this involves discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members have had many bad experiences with discretion, with ministerial discretion on immigration cases and immigration officers exercising discretion. Discretion is all well and good provided that it is used in a way that is both sensitive and alive to the interests of the person affected by the decision. An EO seems rather too junior a rank. It could be a long-serving EO but if so why was he or she so long serving at such a junior rank? That does not lessen our fears. It is more likely that someone of relatively tender years in proud possession of 2 A-levels will have to exercise discretion on a case that can have profound implications for an individual and his or her family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have not made that the subject of an amendment, the Minister should consider pushing this higher up the scale, certainly to an HEO level at minimum and to an SEO level if possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend is not putting down people with 2 A-levels. I have two myself. I do not have any other qualifications apart from my driving licence. He should be a little more careful here. Is he not concerned that once again we have before us paving or enabling legislation? For the third time in three years, we are going through a lengthy Social Security Bill and at every stage the Minister says that the matter will be subject to later regulation. The Bill will go through with all manner of horror clauses yet the Minister cannot give us a precise answer to anything because it is all subject to later regulation. This is a most incompetent way to
	<span class='label label-info column'>274</span>
legislate. It is unfair and undemocratic. There is little opportunity to debate regulations on the Floor of the House because of the pressures of parliamentary time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will not be surprised to hear that I agree with every single word that my hon. Friend has just uttered. It is difficult for us to be reassured when we have not seen the small print. When we try to amend the legislation to make it more acceptable, we are at a grave disadvantage if we cannot see what will be a vital part of an Act, namely the regulations. It is difficult for us to proceed. Unfortunately the Government will not let us see the regulations before Royal Assent, when the Bill will have completed all its parliamentary stages, and it will be too late to change it. We cannot feel comfortable when we cannot see the small print. If the Minister just gave us a clue it might help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That point remains—the Minister has not said anything satisfactory. I suspect that the level of the officer who makes the decision to deprive people of their benefit because it is decided that they are not actively seeking work will be executive officer and lower. The Minister has not given us a guarantee that it would be only executive officers—it could go down to clerical officers. The person over the counter who meets the individual will make a decision without any second opinion. The decision will be made by executive and clerical officers under pressure to achieve statistical shifts by taking people off the unemployment register. There will be an instant right to withdraw benefit without any right of appeal or second opinion. People will be harassed into any rotten old employment training scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is correct. Civil servants will be under pressure to produce results. They will have to show that they have ruled a number of people out. We know that that happens as it is. Civil servants are under great pressure just with the weight of their current problems. It seems unfair to leave such a far-reaching discretionary decision in the hands of someone who is so close to the client and who is so junior within the ranks of the Civil Service. It is so important that the Minister should reflect on this and at some later stage tell us what he is going to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Earlier, my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West moved an amendment that concerned the position of members of Equity. In the interests of the civil servants to whom my hon. Friend refers, we should try to ensure that there is widespread performance of the sketch performed by a member of Equity in a programme in which the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope) and I appeared last week. It featured the clerk from "Bread" who was attempting to get the last person on the unemployed register off the register to satisfy the statistical demands that my hon. Friend described and show that the Government had entirely solved the problem of unemployment. At the end of the sketch the individual who was successfully removed from the register asked the clerk, "What will you do now?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>275</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman replies, may I say that I hope that thespian tendencies will not emerge too much in our debates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise you that they will not, Mr. Winterton. I certainly do not feel like concluding my contributions with a song and a dance. We have seen so many different attempts to change cosmetically the calculation for the unemployment figures—there have been 24—that an element of cynicism creeps into our judgment when we hear the Minister's remarks, particularly when a discretion is involved in such a decision. We know that officers will be pressurised into delivering the sort of statistics that the legislation is aimed to produce. Earlier the Minister agreed that the whole Bill is about making changes. Therefore, there will be great pressure. It is not fair to leave a junior civil servant in such a vulnerable, pressurised position, so I hope that the Minister will reconsider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I originally intervened to ask the Minister whether he recognises the possibility that someone could have his benefit wrongly cut off. Most availability for work cases referred to adjudication officers are decided in favour of the claimant. Is it, therefore, fair to cut off a claimant's benefit before a formal decision is made, if that claimant has been actively seeking employment?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have sought information on how long appeals take, as that consideration should be woven into the provision. It is all very well to say that everything is subject to appeal, but the time the appeal process takes will determine the potential damage or loss that an individual may suffer, particularly as it appears that appeals are to be allowed in most cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To find out what the position is I telephoned Whittington House, where social security appeal tribunals are administered for the London borough of Newham. A helpful clerk informed me that the following timetable operates when an appeal is lodged: the claimant receives an appeal form from the Department of Employment. That takes, on average, between one and three months. The period from receipt of all papers to the date of the hearing is at least another month. Thus, from the date of appeal to the date of hearing takes from two to several months. Even if the appeal goes in favour of the claimant, it can take some weeks before he or she receives any money, and they can be without any money at all in the meantime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we accept that appeals can be lodged, the Minister cannot have it all ways. If he persists in his stance on discretionary decisions, he must accept amendment No. 53, which would ensure that an appeal is heard within 21 days, after having been lodged. At least the claimant would then know how long he would have to wait, after lodging his appeal. I did not hear the Minister respond to amendment No. 53, so I hope that he will deal with it later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is extremely worrying. I presume that the Minister accepts that the person who decides that someone is not actively seeking work in a particular week could be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>276</span>
I wish that we all had a copy of the long document that the Minister read out. It would be even more interesting to see the changes in the first draft that went with the original notes on clauses. Do people who are not actively seeking work and whose money has been stopped still have the right to take their case to the adjudicating officer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone could live on benefit for a short time if he or she already had sheets and food in the house and if the children were well clothed because the family had enjoyed better times. But people who have been living on benefit for a long time experience real poverty, because everything wears out and life becomes very hard. That group of people could be the target of the new test. The Minister is proposing a system under which a junior civil servant could wipe out their money so that they have no income. He says that they have the right to go to an adjudicating officer, but that can take a considerable time. The Minister owes us figures about the current delays in obtaining a decision from an adjudicating officer. Moreover, the very fact that a case can go to an adjudicating officer is an admission that the original decision can be wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, although the Minister knows that an original decision to deprive people of benefit can be wrong, he accepts a system that can take money away even when the decision is wrong. He then says that everything will be all right because, if those people are in difficulty, they can make a new claim and show that they are actively seeking work. That will not do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, in the inefficient, awful reality of our social security system, new claims take a long time. My local office has bars like a prison, because people get so angry and upset. The Minister will know about such problems. A claim cannot be submitted one day and the claimant receive the money the money the next. Secondly, people who claim to be actively seeking work, and who go to the adjudication office because they do not accept the decision to cut off their benefit, will submit evidence that they are and always were actively seeking work. They will supply exactly the same evidence that they supplied before their money was taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such a system is not good enough—it is against natural justice. Very poor people will lose all their income. Furthermore, it is obvious from the shift in the notes on clauses that there has been an internal battle within the Government, presumably between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, which has led to this wretched, mean and nasty position.

If the Minister is allowing a right to go to the adjudication officer, and is accepting that the original decision might be wrong, he must explain why the individuals concerned can have their money taken away wrongly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This debate has made clear a position that is even more appalling than we first thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood. The Minister asserted that, although someone may lose benefit because a comparatively junior official—I shall speak
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>277</span>
about discretion later—has decided that the claimant is not actively seeking work, that does not matter because the judgment will have been made about the preceding two weeks. He says that it does not matter, as claimants could requalify for benefit the first day after that decision has been made if they modify their behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if that were so, they would have to wait another two weeks, as the Minister clearly accepted, and would thus lose benefit for a month. The Minister knows that what he said is absolute rubbish. I should like to use a stronger word, Mr. Winterton, but I fear that you might object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was highlighted by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood, it is ridiculous to say that people can re-establish their claim for benefit. They would probably have to spend the whole day at the DSS, and would not get the necessary compensation anyway. How could they be actively seeking work on the day that they are actively seeking to have their entitlement to benefit restored?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also asks us to believe that the claimant who, after many warnings—the Minister assures us that many warnings will be given—much guidance and advice, is still wilfully not seeking work, will be all right because in a couple of days he can trot into the Department and say, "I have repented my sins. I have seen the light. I'm a reformed character. I am actively seeking work. Here is the proof that I was actively seeking work yesterday." The officer who originally took the decision that that person was conning the system, not actively seeking work and falling foul of the regulations is not going to be convinced. Having taken the decision in the first place, after what the Minister claims will have been an extensive period of warning, the officer—unless he is stupid—will want an extensive period of proof of good behaviour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not talking about a loss of benefit and, possibly, of all income for a minimum of four weeks. It will be more like four weeks, five weeks, or six weeks. How long the period of benefit entitlement is withdrawn will be at the discretion of the very junior officer who made the first decision. That is who will decide when the sinner has reformed and is actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Ladywood, for Islington, North and for Newport, West have rightly referred to the length of time that it will take for a decision to be made, and an appeal to be considered and heard. In addition, the loss of benefit can go on for weeks on end. The Minister must be perfectly aware of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said that the procedure will be explained in leaflets given to people who sign on. In previous debates, both the Minister for Social Security and the Under-Secretary have told us that judgment will vary from case to case, and that the circumstances of each individual will be considered carefully. It will have to be a cleverly worded leaflet to deal adequately with all those individual case
	<span class='label label-info column'>278</span>
considerations. Nevertheless, we are assured that it will contain the relevant warnings, and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The requirement in the Bill is that people should actively seek work every week. By saying that warnings will be given weeks in advance, the Minister is giving another undertaking that breaches the framework of the law. As the law's requirement is that the active job search takes place on a weekly basis, what someone did three weeks ago is irrelevant in proving that he is actively seeking work in the current week. Therefore, I do not believe that the Minister can give that assurance within the framework of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. She will recall that the Minister's comments that someone may have been actively seeking work for many weeks and may have become discouraged, but that does not mean that he can be excused from actively looking for work in another specific week. Whether or not the law allows the Minister to give those assurances, he gives them with one hand and takes them back with another, depending on the context of the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take up the point that has just been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood about guidance. The Minister tells us that there will be guidance, discussions and helpful suggestions about how to find work, but that is not what the law says. Even if the regulations provide for that, it will be in the context of what is appropriate in the circumstances. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West said when moving the amendment, there is no guarantee that such action will be taken. The Minister just hopes so, because it helps him to justify the way in which this enormously significant decision will be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the vast amount of discretion to deprive someone of his source of income that will rest in the hands of comparatively junior officials. A number of examples spring immediately to mind, which cast some doubt on the weight that the Committee is entitled to put on the Minister's assurance. I hope that you will allow me to refer briefly to one example which is outside the scope of the Bill, Mr. Winterton, because it is relevant to how specific guidelines may be interpreted. It is a case that I raised a few days ago on the Floor of the House on a point of order. Immigration guidelines state that a matter can be re-examined if a Member of Parliament considers that exceptional and compelling circumstances arise in a case that an immigration officer has had a chance to consider but has not taken fully into account. In my somewhat acrimonious telephone conversation with the Minister of State, Home Office, I was told that that did not mean that the merits of the case can be re-examined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
