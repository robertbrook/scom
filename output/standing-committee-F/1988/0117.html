	<p>[MR. NICHOLAS WINTERTON 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>Social Security Bill</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><q><p>That, during consideration of the Social Security Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—[	<i>Mr. Scott.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be aware that there are occasions when the material, matter, and controversial nature of a Bill will be such that everything to do with it, even the Sittings Motion, becomes a point of controversy. Although we find parts of the Bill deeply objectionable, Opposition Members have nevertheless decided that it is important that we discuss the matter of the Bill, and the policy that the Government are pursuing, at as early a stage as possible. We wish to place it on record that our deliberate decision to go at once into discussion of the Bill in no way implies that we find the Bill acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Archy Kirkwood 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Roxburgh and Berwickshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) and I have had discussions, during the passage of other Social Security Bills, about how Opposition Members handle proceedings. I am pleased to hear that the official Opposition have decided to conduct the Bill in this way. Certain clauses will be strongly contested, and I hope to contribute to those debates. It is sensible for both sides of the Committee to proceed on that basis, and I hope that we shall make steady progress on the lines that the official Opposition suggest. I warmly welcome that decision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the first Committee on which I have had the honour to serve on which you, Mr. Winterton, are in the Chair, and I know that we can therefore expect a lively and well-ordered Committee stage. I ask hon. Tory Members, however, to enter the spirit of constructive approach to the Bill, by actually joining in debates. Having served on many Standing Committees, I have noticed that all the weight of argument, in terms of its quality and content, is not only taken but carried by the Opposition. We see in front of us a large number of Trappist monks who sit there writing and catching up with their constituency correspondence. I hope that, while they will doubtless be as assiduous as ever in their constituency business, they will join us in being constructive in their approach to the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Favell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful, Mr. Winterton, if you would tell the Committee whether you wish to be referred to as the Chairman or the Chair. I have never thought of you as wooden, well upholstered, or soft.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I am the Chairman of the Committee. As Chairman of the Committee I welcome the constructive attitude of the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) who is spokesman for the main Opposition, and also the views expressed by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) for the Democratic parties. I am sure that the views expressed by the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) have been noted by the Conservative members of the Committee and the Ministers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That, during the consideration of the Social Security Bill, the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.</p></q></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two announcements to make. First, I remind the Committee that there is a financial resolution with the Bill, of which copies are available in the Room. Secondly, I call the Committee's attention to the fact that adequate notice of amendments should be given. As a general rule, I do not intend to call starred amendments. Very exceptionally, I am accepting starred amendments today, but only because of the confusion that arose last Thursday and Friday over when the Committee was to sit. I hope that Members will appreciate the position, and accept that I intend to call starred amendments only exceptionally today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><q><p>That the Bill be considered in the following order, namely, Clauses 1 to 17, Schedule 1, Clause 18, Schedule 2, Clause 19, Schedule 3, Clause 20, Schedule 4, Clauses 21 and 22, Schedule 5, Clauses 23 to 27, Schedule 6, Clauses 28 and 29, new Clauses, new Schedules, Schedule 7.—[	<i>Mr. Scott.</i>]</p></q></p>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 1</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>REPAYMENT OF CONTRIBUTIONS WHERE EARNINGS BECOME REPAYABLE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 1, in page 1, line 7, after "provisions)", insert
	<br><q><p>"after paragraph 5 there shall be inserted—</p></q>
	<br><q><p>'5A. Regulations shall provide for the repayment of such proportion of any primary Class 1 or Class 2 contributions paid in 1988-89 and subsequent years as would otherwise be used to meet the current cost to the National Insurance Fund of contributions paid under section 3(1 Kb) or section 7 of the Social Security Act 1986.';</p></q>
	<br><q><p>and."</p></q>
The clause provides for the repayment of national insurance contributions in certain circumstances. The amendment provides for the repayment to either employed or self-employed contributors of as much of thier contributions as has been used to finance the 2 per cent, bribe payable to those who choose to opt out of an occupational scheme or the state earnings-related pension scheme and take out a personal pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is valuable, not only for the opportunity that it affords the Committee to look,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
however briefly, at the issue, but for the light that it casts on the Government's principles and policies with regard to the treatment of the national insurance contributions and funds. It also casts a little light, which will be valuable to all members of the Committee, on how much weight one should give to, and with what care one should scrutinise, the assurances given by Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not everyone may have studied the matter in the closest possible detail. Therefore, I shall remind the Committee of the background to the 2 per cent, bribe. In 1984 or thereabouts, the then Secretary of State for Health and Social Security, as his contribution to the privatisation programme and to the new wave of social change that was sweeping the country—we are told by the Prime Minister that there is no such thing as society, but pursue social engineerng—came up with the idea of personal portable pensions. He described them as "a pension of their own", as if, in some obscure way, a pension provided in any other way was not a pension of someone's own. The consultation document on this idea met with a profound lack of enthusiasm, not only in the pensions industry but more widely, because it made it clear that a personal portable pension was likely to be such a rotten buy that no one in his or her right mind would contract out of the state scheme or an occupational scheme to secure his or her retirement income in this way.

To make his proposal attractive the right hon. Gentleman had to undermine the basis of the existing pension schemes. Initially, Government proposed to abolish the state earnings-related pension scheme, which was a much better bet and better value for money than anything that could be provided by an individual, for reasons that may be obvious to the Committee and to which I shall come in a moment. That proposal provoked a furore because by chance—no doubt by mischance in the eyes of the right hon. Gentleman—both the Prime Minister and the previous Secretary of State had given specific assurances, in the preceding general election campaign, that no such move would be made. Consequently the right hon. Gentleman had to retreat from his initial proposal to abolish SERPS. Therefore, he settled for what seemed to him like the best bet in the circumstances, and substantially weakened not only SERPS itself but the standards that have to be met in occupational pension schemes because those standards are set by the baseline of what is provided in the state scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's figures show that the Secretary of State's proposals, which were pushed through in the Social Security Act 1986, halved the value of the state earnings-related pension scheme. That is why we are in the position in which we are today. It is possible to argue that a personal pension is of some value to those under 40 or under 45, as the case may be, only because it is compared with the new halved-in-value SERPS, not because personal pensions are a good idea or a good buy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personal pensions are potentially a disastrous investment for two reasons. First, they are personal pensions. Whereas in SERPS or an occupational scheme, a person spreads the risk of providing for
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
his income in retirement across a wide group, in a personal pension he undertakes the whole risk and the sole risk. One of the most important features of the Government scheme that is being promoted through the 2 per cent, bribe is that not only does the individual take the whole risk himself but the extent of that risk is made explicit because there is no underpinning, no guarantee. At least, with SERPS and an occupational scheme, there is some underpinning, some guarantee, some baseline below which a person is not allowed to fall, or the scheme is unacceptable to the Occupational Pensions Board or the community. With a personal pensions scheme, there is a flaw—the Government refuse to write in any kind of undertaking or guarantee. The individual who takes out such a pension bears the entire risk without any back-up from the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why it is so dangerous is that personal pensions—like occupational schemes, which are now acceptable but which were not before the Secretary of State's changes in 1986—are basically money purchase schemes. They rely entirely on the performance of investment. A person may be fortunate with the investment that he makes, either through an individual programme or a unit-trust scheme. His investments may perform well and may be performing well when he retires. However, if that is not the case, that person could have a completely inadequate income on retirement. What we find objectionable in the 2 per cent, bribe and seek to address through the amendment, is that the Government are offering the bribe, which they call an incentive or which Tory Members might prefer to call a subsidy, paid for by taxpayer's money to encourage people to enter a pension scheme that might be completely unsatisfactory and may not even provide them with security in retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also find the bribe objectionable because it involves the whole national insurance scheme. All contributors to the national insurance scheme will pay for this bribe, despite the fact that, by definition, not all national insurance contributors are eligible to benefit from it, even though we would argue that they would be unwise to take advantage of the opportunity offered. Only a minority of contributors to the scheme could benefit from it. It is not available to members of occupational schemes that were already contracted out in 1986, nor to the self-employed, nor to a person for any period during which he is not in paid employment. That excludes the unemployed, young people on youth training schemes and those caring for the elderly, the disabled or children. Only a small proportion of those who are paying for this bribe can benefit from it, if "benefit" can result from a move that persuades people into something that is not in their best interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, apart from the fact that the whole scheme is funding this bribe, there is the question of the level at which the bribe is being funded. The Committee considered the Social Security Act 1986, of which a few of us are survivors, was given misleading information when the proposal was put forward. It was estimated in 1986 that the cost of the 2 per cent.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
bribe would be £60 million, which the then Secretary of State described as "not particularly costly".. Hon. Members may recall, when we debate other amendments that may cost £500,000, £1.5 million or some such sum, and that the Government say are wildly extravagant and cannot be afforded, that the then Secretary of State described a bribe of £60 million as "not particularly costly", and suggested that it would be the equivalent of between 500,000 or 1 million additional people contracting out, depending on which date one takes the figure that the Government gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More recent figures from the Government Actuary estimate that £310 million of "incentives", as he is instructed to call them, but which we prefer to call more accurately "bribes", will be paid in 1989–90, £80 million relating to contributions from 1987–88 and £230 million to 1988–89. That figure is the minimum cost of paying the bribe, because it consists only of the moneys paid out, and does not take account of income lost to the fund because of people contracting out and the loss of the rebate on their contributions. In 1988–89, the real cost to the fund resulting from lost income and the 2 per cent, bribe, is £430 million, and for 1989–90, we estimate that the loss to the fund will be some £600 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The former Secretary of State may have described £60 million as "not particularly costly", but he, and all members of the Committee, will concede that £600 million is a substantial sum. On average, the bribe will cost every contributor to the national insurance fund £30. The bribe will allow the state to use its money—and the taxpayers' money because until the Bill is enacted, there is a Treasury supplement—to pay £600 million and introduce a scheme in which only a small minority of contributors to the fund can "participate"—that is a better word than "benefit". If they do so, they may soon regret it—indeed, we may all regret it with them. Opposition Members find the Government's encouragement of the scheme imprudent. Although the Government may issue consultation documents and say that if people make investments that do not prosper, it is their problem and they will have to bear the burden of having an inadequate income in retirement, the chances are high that the Government of the day, of whatever political shade or colour, will have to pick up the pieces—especially for those who have a totally inadequate retirement income— because this Government gave people an incentive to go into the scheme, telling them that it could offer them a potential advantage. For all those reasons, the Government should seriously consider the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we go through the Bill, the Government will tell us that all manner of savings, some minor and others less so, should be made because the taxpayer must be protected from excessive spending. However, I notice that the Government's press release states that the savings will be £100 million, although the figures in the financial memorandum total about £130 million—about one third more. That pales into insignificance beside the money that is being lost to the national insurance fund from this proposal, which the Government are pursuing on

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the hon. Lady. I accept part of what she says. No one is compelled to take out a personal pension, although people are encouraged by the bribe. I am interested to learn that the hon. Lady thinks that the scheme is a good way to spend £600 million of the contributions to the national insurance fund. We shall bear that in mind in later discussions. She is right to say that no one is compelled to enter a scheme that allows people to make their own arrangements. Whether they are allowed more flexibility depends on the circumstances. My hon. Friends and I argue, and many pensions experts would agree, that the maximum flexibility is offered by the state scheme. Part of the argument for personal pensions is their transferability—if one changes jobs, the personal pension accompanies one. However, the state scheme does not care for whom one works, where or in what job. It recognises only the income that is put in and repays it by entitlement to SERPS.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of our concerns about personal pensions is that by an ideological decision of the former Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Security, it was made necessary for people to contract out of the state scheme in order to have a personal pension. That is unnecessary. Opposition Members have nothing against greater flexibility in the state scheme, nor against encouraging people to make additional provision for their retirement. The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Gorman) is right to say that there is an ideological difference. We are concerned because people are being encouraged to make wholly inadequate provision for their retirement although the Government know full well that, should the provision turn out to be inadequate, as in many cases it undoubtedly will—if that were not so, the Government would have had no hesitation about underpinnings or guarantees—the people receiving the wholly inadequate retirement income will unquestionably turn to the state for support, since otherwise some may not have enough to live on. People are being given a flexibility, but the practical result will be that they will end up on the doorstep of the Secretary of State for Social Security, saying "I made my own arrangements. I did
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
so because the Government of the day encouraged it—indeed, they offered me a financial incentive."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the accuracy of Ministers' statements, although the then Secretary of State told the Committee that the incentive would be available for five years, he made it available for six years, because although the legislation specified the finishing date of the scheme, it did not specify the starting date. Using the freedom of what was not said in the legislation—an issue to which we shall undoubtedly refer on many occasions—he extended the period of the availability of the bribe to six years. The individual will therefore be entitled to say to a future Secretary of State, "The then Government encouraged me. They said it would give me more flexibility and that I would have a better chance to make provision for myself. I believed them and took out this scheme. The state has encouraged me to make inadequate provision for my retirement."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Lady also observed that Opposition Members believe in dragooning people into schemes. Partly in order to protect the state from wholly unpredictable future demands, we believe in encouraging people to make proper provision for their retirment. We also believe that there ought to be provision of good occupational schemes to give people independence and flexibility, and to protect the community from unpredictable demands for which provision has not been made. Opposition Members advocate the consensus view up until 1986, when the Secretary of State saw this little wheeze as a good way to make his name—in the Conservative party, I hasten to add. I am not sure that it has done his name any good anywhere else. We continue to believe that it is advisable for people to make sound provision for their retirement and for the state, through the provision of good standard occupational schemes so that people are not robbed and through the provision of a good standard state scheme, to help people to prepare for and think about their circumstances on retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister explain why a scheme, which we were told only a couple of years or so ago would cost £60 million, is costing £230 million or more? Why is a net cost to the fund of £600 million acceptable in these circumstances? Since the Government were able to start the 2 per cent, bribe earlier than they intended and since it is costing substantially more then they said was acceptable, do they plan to end the 2 per cent, bribe earlier?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Peter Lloyd)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> I suspect that this first debate is a re-run of the debate some three years ago on pensions reform. Although I was not a party to the discussions, I know that the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) was very much involved. She has remembered a great deal of that debate and has made her points clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is plain that the hon. Lady is still not concerned about the potential burden of SERPS in the early part of the next century, if it is not modified or replaced. She differs from the Government on the possibility and prospects of the personal pensions schemes that the Government have introduced.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
I do not think that the amendment or the clause allows me to re-run that debate. If it did—and it does not, Mr. Winterton, because you nod—you would no doubt stop me, call me to order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would require regulations to be brought forward, as the hon. Lady said, obliging employers' pension funds and personal pension providers to repay the 2 per cent, incenive—not bribe—to facilitate, not to bribe, payments which had been made to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me remind the Committee why that incentive was introduced in the first place. The Social Security Act 1986, as the hon. Lady said, introduced some substantial changes in pension provision. Up to that time, the only alternative to remaining fully within the state earnings-related pension scheme was to belong to a salary-related occupational pension scheme. That option was open only to half the work force. By introducing contracted-out money purchase—COMP—schemes, employers and employees could contract out without the open-ended commitment of providing the salary-related pension which deterred many small employers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, no all employers want to offer schemes and for some people occupational schemes are not the option they prefer. So we allowed people to contract out of the state pension scheme by choosing an individual personal pension scheme with which to save for their retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One can argue, as the hon. Lady did forcefully and clearly—as she usually argues, even when she is not right—that the incentive should not be paid from the national insurance fund and that it would be an imposition on other members of the fund who were not receiving that benefit, as many of them are already contracted out and have the advantage of an occupational pension fund. In bringing forward these proposals the Government carefully considered the contributory principle which I agree is part and parcel of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The conclusion which the Government reached was that the incentive should come from the national insurance fund. One effect is to reduce the longer-term burdens on the fund which SERPS will and would have created. I know that the hon. Lady thinks differently, but to go through that argument would be to go through again the arguments that were then clearly spelt out in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle has been accepted by both parties for many years. The 1975 Act provided for a 0.5 per cent, incentive to encourage individuals to opt into occupational schemes. We are talking about a matter not of principle but of judgment about what is needed to get these schemes off the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far, more than 800,000 have opted for personal pension schemes since they were introduced in July last year, and more than 6,500 new COMP schemes have been set up since last April. The hon. Lady referred to the forecast of the cost of the incentive when the Bill was being debated. She also referred to the answer given to her recently by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State about what the cost may

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
be for this year and next year. The figures were very much higher. Both figures come from the Government Actuary. The difference between them is explained entirely by the greater popularity of opting out of the personal pension schemes and the COMP schemes than was originally expected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It confirms our judgment that there is a real demand for extra choice.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None at all. It has started off even better than we had hoped, it is continuing very well and we expect many more people to take up the opportunities that have been provided. Opportunities were clearly wanted.

There was grave doubt among Opposition members on the Committee, who did not really believe it. But the proof of the pudding is that they are doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it reach the point at which those exercising the option are cast into severe doubt the nature of the fund?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It provides a temporary incentive. The hon. Lady asked whether we had any plans to continue it. We do not. We have plans to continue under the rule in the 1986 Act that will bring it to a term.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the Government have no intention of making the incentive more attractive, through some form of tax change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have no plans to do that. A major reason why it would not even have been considered is that the incentive is working so well now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 2 per cent, incentive is a small part of the strategy to encourage the expansion of occupational
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
and personal pension schemes, and to provide a choice that half the work-force simply did not have and that many of whom wanted. Before last year, employees not in ocupational pension schemes had access to a sort of occupational scheme—the so-called section 226 retirement annuity contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite a wide range of schemes on offer, and generous tax treatment, take-up was disapointing. The new personal pensions are more attractive, particularly as they can be used to contract out of SERPS. However, we believed that it was important to help to get the ball rolling, and something extra—in the form of the 2 per cent, incentive—was appropriate. It is a modest incentive, despite what the hon. Lady said, and it is temporary—as it will last as she herself said, for only five years. However, I believe that it is worth while to extend choice to those who have been denied it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons—that it has worked in providing additional choice for people who clearly want it, because they are opting for it, but did not have that choice before—I hope that the Opposition will not press the amendment. If they choose to do so, my hon. Friends will ensure that it is defeated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am a survivor of the Committee that considered the 1986 Act. That was, from memory, the only issue on which I had some differences with the official Opposition. I recognised that there was a need for the extra choice provided by the Government scheme, but I was not at all happy with the terms of what the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) properly called in 1986 a bribe. My main worry at that time was the damage that it might cause to some occupational pension schemes. The Government made some amendments, which assuaged some of my worst fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, however, more sympathetic to the general thrust of the Government's proposals than, perhaps, the official Opposition are, but the Minister's case this morning is fundamentally flawed. If he says that that incentive was so necessary in order to get the scheme off the ground, and in the same breath announces—he did not rebut the information, new to me, that was laid before the Committee by the hon. Lady—that it costs £600 million instead of £60, then the straightforward conclusion that I draw is that incentive was not necessary. The schemes were free-standing, and so impressive, welcome, and well laid out, that no encouragement was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government said this morning that it is a temporary incentive, a modest attempt to encourage schemes, and that they thought that it would cost a mere £60 million. But it has, of course, cost £600 million. Therefore, they said, we should not worry, as it would go away in the fullness of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a major miscalculation by the Government. I, for one, tried to warn them at the time that the scheme would be self-supporting and would run quite properly, if left to its own devices, and that that amount of taxpayers' or national insurance contribution fund money was not necessary, I have been proved right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has jam all over his face. To sit there and calmly say in Committee, "Don't worry, this is

temporary. It is all going away. We have only got it wrong to the tune of £540 million, but what is that between friends?" on a Tuesday morning in January is disgraceful. He should be saying this morning that the Government are taking steps urgently to revise the amount of money that they are putting into the so-called temporary incentive, to try to make it cost less. It is clearly not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be right that it was not necessary in the end, but that was not the view of many people at the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it was not. The hon.

If the jam all over the Minister's face is the greater success of the Government's scheme than even they expected, I hope that I and many of my colleagues will have a great deal of jam over our faces during the rest of this Session of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister cannot hide behind that argument. He is no more able to prove that he is right than I am. He cannot prove to the Committee that if this incentive, temporary or otherwise, costing £600 million had not existed, the scheme would not have been as successful as it already is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the scheme had not been successful, the hon. Member for Derby, South would have said, for the Opposition, that she was right to tell us that people did not want these things. The hon. Gentleman said that he was not wholly at one with the main Opposition—that he was inclined to disagree with them. He was much in favour of the scheme. He said that if only the Government had given a decent incentive to get the scheme off the ground, we would not have faced the disasters that we do. The hon. Gentleman is trying to have it both ways.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have provided an incentive for a desirable end, with which the hon. Gentleman apparently agrees. The incentive has worked well. The extra cash is involved because more people are opting out, which means that in the medium and long term there will be that much more saving to the national insurance fund. The whole effect is benign, beneficial, and a great success, and demonstrates how wise the 1986 legislation was, and how popular have been the opportunities brought in. We can say that the incentive has clinched it. Maybe it was a little more than it might have been; maybe if it were not as good as it was, so many people would not have opted out already, certainly it has done the job that it was intended to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an interesting debate. I gently remind the Minister and the Committee that what he referred to as my views on SERPS and its cost, and whether therefore it was necessary for the Government to take the steps that they did, are not merely my views. They are the considered, professional opinion of the Government Actuary, who said that there was no justification, in changed projections and changed figures, for the Government's decision, because what had changed was not the facts of the pension scheme as proposed, but the political will to implement it. It is important that we remember that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also said that there was a much smaller incentive in 1979 to persuade people into occupational pension schemes. That is where we come to the parting of the ways. The Opposition think that it is one thing to encourage people to enter into good schemes with sound underpinning, which will give them better provision in retirement, and quite another to encourage them into schemes which may make poor provision for them in retirement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said several times that Opposition Members have argued that people did not want these schemes. That was not what we argued at all. We believe that there should be provision for people to make a whole range of arrangements for themselves in their retirement. We have no objection to flexibility. We object to gross under-provision, and our reasons are the mirror image of those that the hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) gave. That is, if people make gross under-provision for themselves in their retirement, they inevitably fall as a charge on the community as a whole. Far from saving the taxpayer money in the long run, that would encourage a burden to fall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

An estimate is that the operating expenses of the state scheme are 5 per cent., those of occupational schemes are 8 to 10 per cent, and rising. In terms of value for the money that an individual puts into the scheme, there is no question, because of the vast numbers involved and the way in which overheads can be spread, that a personal pension is not the best buy. We were concerned that the 2 per cent, bribe was window dressing to make a bad buy look more acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A point that I omitted from my remarks and to which the Minister did not draw attention was one of the reasons why the Government felt that the 2 per cent, bribe might be needed. One disadvantage of personal pension schemes is that, as there is no compulsion on the individual to take one out, there is no compulsion on the employer to make any contribution to an employee's personal pension in contrast with any occupational scheme and with the state scheme. As I said in my opening remarks, the person is taking on his shoulders the entire risk of provision for retirement. This is likely to be disadvantageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We deplore the 2 per cent, input from the Government in the early years of the scheme, which will allow the presentation of figures that are misleading about the real effect. We may wish to return to matter when considering some of the schedules dealing with the provision of pensions, but I will not dwell on it now, except to say that we remain concerned that people may find that inadequate protection is offered for the money that they have put in and on which they have received an inadequate return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister put the argument that he was bound to put when he said that the reason why the scheme had cost so much was that more people had taken up the scheme than was anticipated. The Government Actuary's initial suggestion was that if 500,000 people contracted out, the cost of the bribe would be £60 million. The directly comparable cost is a mere £230 million or £240 million, only four times the amount that was initially suggested, although the Minister said that less than twice as many people had taken out personal pensions. There is no doubt that the cost of preparing for the scheme has far outweighed what was anticipated. When one takes account also of the cost of contracting out and of the money that does not go into the fund, one gets the full picture of the overall cost of £600 million or more this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that although the Government did not listen to the Government Actuary about the cost of SERPS, they listened to him about the cost of the 2 per cent, bribe. He implied that if we thought that the Government had got it wrong, we should blame the Government Actuary. He did not say so, but that implication might be construed by an uncharitable listener. Whether he was saying so or not, the existence of the 2 per cent, bribe and its consequences for the fund are costing some £30 a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
year per head. This is a substantial sum and should make the Government consider, as the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) pointed out, whether the incentive was necessary. In other circumstances, the Government would admit that the expenditure is running wholly out of control, so they should consider bringing it to an abrupt end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened with incredulity while the Minister described an overall cost to the national insurance fund of.£600 million and a minimum cost of £230 million to £240 million as "modest". He said that the Government's great success story had led to greater cost. When the value of single payments that were made to people who were largely unemployed, sick or elderly rose from £200 million to £400 million a year, the Government did not say that that was a success story, but that such people were defrauding the state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Banks</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made a superb point. I remember asking a Minister whether he should congratulate the welfare rights officers and those in charge of the various campaigns that had been run by local authorities to encourage take-up of single payments, and the response was that unfortunately too many people were taking them. My hon. Friend has made a superb point and won me over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for his kind remarks. He is right. Far from saying that the work of the welfare rights officers had been a great success and how wonderful it was that people were encouraged to claim what was after all only their right in law, although it was not discretionary, and they had to meet harsh tests before receiving such a payment, the Government were extremely nasty about those successful welfare rights workers. They said that the cost of the scheme was spiralling out of control and must be restrained, and they restrained it. There is a remarkable coincidence. The Government restrained the cost of single payments to the poorest members of the community to a maximum of £60 million in grants, although there is a small extra allowance for loans, which is recirculating money and not money given to claimants, because a pay-out rate of £400 million in single payments was a spiralling out of control. However, when it comes to personal pensions, an estimate of £60 million is not spiralling out of control but is a greater success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that we have drawn the cost of this to the Government's attention, perhaps we should send copies of the debate to the Chancellor of the Exchequer because although the Minister thinks that this is a great success, the Chancellor might take a different view. We remain of the view that the 2 per cent, bribe was at best disadvantageous, that it was misleading in suggesting that people might have good provision in retirement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

pensioners, the loss of contributions from those who are opting out under the bribe or inducement will be much greater than any savings that have been made to the national insurance fund, so that it is a bad deal for all elderly people, particularly with the problem of the growing elderly population. The hon. Member for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) should understand that because of her views.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It is a bad deal in every respect and one which for a short-term political advantage will leave enormous problems for a future Government. However, I am delighted to have extracted from the Minister the statement that a fourfold increase in expenditure is not only a success story but a modest cost well worth the expenditure and that he considers a loss of £600 million to the fund in these terms. Therefore it might be helpful if we did not press the amendment because we might wish to return to this issue.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Front Bench spokesman" when we are women. I wish to put a genuine point to the Minister. I may be wrong. The Minister will know that, under the Wages Act 1986, there is a provision that a person may have 10 per cent, of his wages deducted if there is a suggestion from his employer that he needs to be disciplined. The classic case is of someone working in a shop or a petrol station when there is a shortage in the till. It involves injustice because often the shortage could arise from the behaviour of one of any number of people. 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the Committee please be quiet? I wish to hear what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) has to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. Often there is a great deal of injustice for the individual concerned, because the shortage on the till could be a genuine mistake or it could be the fault of any one of a number of people, but a deduction is allowed under the Wages Act. Of course, when that was being enacted, the Government gave us a firm assurance that that provision was a modification of the existing powers of wages councils, which would be retained permanently. Now, consultations about getting rid of those powers are taking place, which shows how much honour there is in Government assurances. The provisions of the Bill are yet more of the measures that the Government have pursued to cut the level of wages for the lowest-paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
This relates to clause 1, because if people pay national insurance on their wages and subsequently face a 10 per cent, deduction, they should have that national insurance returned to them. I am sure that the Government would not wish people to pay national insurance, that is then taken away. Under the powers in clause 1, the Government would have the right to make provision to restore the national insurance so paid. Will the Minister give an undertaking that, if he has not already considered that point, he will do so now? Will he seriously consider making regulations to return national insurance payments to those who have been treated in that way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not considered the point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short), but I follow it. I do not know what the current practice is but, from what she says and from what I know that the clause seeks to do, I know that if there is a problem such as she fears, it would be possible to bring in regulations to put it right. I shall take counsel as to current practices and I write to her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ask a rather pedantic, legalistic question. The rubric on clause 1 is:
	<br><q><p>"Repayment of contributions where earnings become repayable."</p></q>
The clause is intended to correct an omission in schedule 1 of the parent Act, the Social Security Act 1975. That schedule lists matters for which regulations may be made. It is an all-covering provision. That, of course, includes provisions for the refund of national insurance contributions to be made when they have been taken in error.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My question was prompted by a matter raised in a Library brief. There are circumstances in which contributions should be refunded where no error is involved—for example, when a woman has accepted maternity pay but has chosen not to return to work after the birth of her baby. Both she and here employer would have paid national insurance contributions on the maternity pay and when she repays the money to her employer, those contributions should be refunded. Clause 1 adds a paragraph to the schedule to enable such refunds to be made. Am I right in thinking that people have been denied refunds in those circumstances? If that is so, the Committee should know. It would be quite wrong for people to have been denied refunds in circumstances such as those referred to in the Library brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is on the pedantic, legal point. Why on earth do the Government need powers to repay money that they have no legal right to withhold in any event? I cannot understand the need for the clause. There must be an important, deeply complicated legal reason, but I do not think that it is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 am</p>

mistake in the calculation and the wrong amount of national insurance has been paid, powers exist for the mistake to be rectified. However, when the amount of national insurance has been correctly paid, there is no power to repay. This is unsatisfactory, as the hon. Gentleman rightly says. We are taking the opportunity in the Bill to put the matter right. We can put it right on maternity pay, which was specifically mentioned, and if any other mistake comes to light, we shall have the power to put it right by regulation without having to wait for primary legislation. The hon. Gentleman's fear is correct. We have no power—we want it and the clause will give it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>ABOLITION OF TREASURY SUPPLEMENT TO CONTRIBUTIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Flynn	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newport, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 2, in page 1, line 12, at beginning insert
	<br><q><p>"With the exception of such payments as may be necessary in order to increase the sums mentioned in section 63(3) of the Social Security Act 1986 for the purpose of making good, wholly or in part, the fall in the value of those sums, relative to average earnings, since 30th November 1977, and preventing any such fall from reoccurring.".</p></q>
This important amendment seeks to ensure that Treasury supplements continue to the extent that they are necessary to meet, wholly or in part, the cost of restoring the value of benefits as a proportion of average earnings. Clause 2 and this amendment will probably affect more people and to a greater extent than any other clause in this unworthy Bill. The Trappist monks are leaving. I hoped that one of the Trappist nuns would stay, because she was providing an interesting interlude in the monologues of Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members thought that there was a moment of confession from the Government in a press release that they issued on 6 December, which we assumed was the description of the Bill. The heading on the press release was
	<br><q><p>"No Let-Up on Social Security Fraud."</p></q>
We were hoping that there would be a let up on the fraudulent behaviour of the Government, for the past decade, in social security matters. The press release describes a different matter, and unconsciously
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
provides an accurate account of how the Government have been behaving. It says:
	<br><q><p>"There is a substantial amount of conscious, deliberate fraud in social security."</p></q>
It is about to continue with this clause.
	<br><q><p>"This is not glamorous or even excusable."</p></q>
It is certainly not glamorous for the pensioner and those in receipt of benefit, who have been subjected to the theft of benefits due to them over the past 10 years, and it is not excused by them.
	<br><q><p>"It is theft. People who defraud social security are stealing money that should be available for the old, the poor and the sick."</p></q>
This clause continues that theft, which has been subtle and scarcely noticed, but relentless and continuous. It will cut a lifeline to the elderly and the needy for 78 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1911, Lloyd George introduced a Bill with the slogan "ninepence for fourpence". The Bill sought to introduce a fourpenny contribution from the employee compared with fivepence from the employer and the state combined. In 1920, it was replaced by a contribution of 4d, 4d and 2d, the 2d coming from the state. Those proportions remained in 1945, with contributions of 20 per cent, from the state and 40 per cent, from both the employer and the employee. This obligation was recognised by Governments as fair and equitable for almost three quarters of a century. Until 1979, when the Conservatives came to power, the state contribution was 18 per cent. Now that long-recognised duty to contribute in this way is about to be ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seem to be two main reasons for this and two effects. It is another part of the great shift of money from the poorest in society to the richest. It will also mean the continued impoverishment of benefits, especially pensions. The cost will shift from the general taxpayer to the payer of national insurance. Hon. Members may say that they are the same people and, to a large extent, they are, but they do not bear equally the twin cost of income tax and national insurance. National insurance is a highly regressive tax. It hits the low paid at the threshold of £41 a week, where they immediately start paying 5 per cent, of their income. It goes on to the intermediate level of 7 per cent, until the upper earnings limit of £305, where the rate is now 9 per cent. That has grown progressively almost annually from 6.5 per cent, in 1979.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax is proportional until the upper earnings limit is reached, but after the limit of £305, the 9 per cent., as a proportion, continually declines to 1 per cent, and below, once the weekly wage gets to the Barenboim level. The cake is becoming smaller, in relative terms. The Government are pulling out from their obligations to supply their share of the ingredients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a valuable briefing from the Library on new calculations that illustrate the illusion of this Government as the great Government who are handing out large sums of money. It makes clear who constitute the small group of beneficiaries. The new Library figures confirm that a married man with two children, on average earnings—an estimated £254 a week—has seen his total tax burden—income tax,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0035">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
national insurance, indirect taxes and rates—increase from 35.1 per cent, of his gross earnings in 1978-79 to £37.3 per cent, this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those who are lower down the income scale there is an even worse effect. A married man with two children on half-average earnings of £127 a week saw his tax burden increase from 2.5 per cent, to 7.1 per cent, of gross earnings between 1978-79 and 1988-89. Those on higher incomes scored far better. A married man with two children on 500 per cent, of average earnings experienced a fall in his tax burden from 48.8 per cent, of gross earnings to only 34.2 per cent. A similar man on 2,000 per cent, of average earnings, just over £5,000 a week, saw the Inland Revenue share of his earnings drop from 74.3 per cent, to 38.5 per cent.—a handsome reward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor has received, and this year will receive another income bonanza, including income from national insurance because of the increases in earnings that have occurred. The whole key to understanding the damage that has been done and that will continue to be done under the clause is the disparity between the rise in earnings and the rise in prices and benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the national insurance fund is now in a healthy state, heading for a surplus of £2.6 billion this year. The reason, of course, is entirely due to that disparity. Earnings have increased the contributions to the funds and the Government still perversely refuse to link pensions to earnings, denying basic pensioners the increase to which they are entitled—the increase in the share of the prosperity enjoyed by other members of society, especially those who are very well off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pockets of the pensioners have been picked every year since 1979-80 to finance the Government reduction in national insurance from 18 per cent, to 5 per cent. If the clause is enacted, their cheating on the basic pension will become ossified and a permanent feature of the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The adequacy of the benefits depends on how they compare with the general level of earnings and other income. That simple fact was recognised by both Labour and Conservative Governments during the whole post-war period until 1979. The 1974 Labour Government wrote into the Social Security Act 1975 a legal requirement to increase pensions and other long-term benefits in line with either earnings or prices, whichever was more favourable. That decision was criticised at the time as too generous. There may be some substance to that criticism. The combination of the two criteria could, in some circumstances, produce a ratchet effect so that over a period of years pensions would rise faster than either earnings or prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until 1979, no one seriously suggested that the link with earnings was too generous. On the contrary, it gave statutory recognition to a principle that was always accepted in practice. That was borne out by some striking figures that were produced recently by the Library statisticians. They showed what would have happened if the Government's present policy of tying benefits to prices only, so that real value never increased, had been followed between 1948 and April 1989. They produced the remarkable fact
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
that the April 1989 equivalent of the 26s basic pension introduced in 1948 would have been the miserable amount of £18.60 a week, compared with what it will be in April: £43.60. It would have been just about half what the pension is now. That is the track along which the Government are going and that impoverishment of pensioners, that cheating of pensioners, is now part of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures are constantly being mentioned, and it will do no harm to repeat them, perhaps with the addition of another one. Under the Labour Government pensions went up, in real terms, by 20 per cent. Under the Conservative Government they have increased by 2.1 per cent. A calculation relating to the poorest pensioners I am happy to give in some detail. The poorest pensioners of all are those who will be the beneficiaries of the Lawson embarrassment bonus. Their increments, in real terms, have been reduced by about £1 a week by the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government will argue, as they have always argued that the pensioners are growing richer. They take that calculation from their bumper book, "How to Lie with Statistics". The magic words before that claim are always "the average pensioners." Of course, that is true. Pensioners as a group are becoming richer compared with many other groups. But the reasons for that are mainly the earnings-related supplements, the pensions that are now coming into payment under the Labour-introduced scheme that the Secretary of state tried unsuccessfully to abolish. He succeeded only in mutilating it for future pensioners. But millions of pensioners are still wholly or mainly dependent on basic pensions and have not shared in this improvement—as the Government were forced to admit, following the Chancellor's embarrasing indiscretions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure if the Committee is familiar with the embarrassment bonus theory of how to get money out of the Government. Following the decision to give the small amount of money which was not available three weeks previously, on the grounds of fairness, justice and compassion, in order to save the face of a vain and crumbling Chancellor the money was pulled out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A whole range of worthy organisations is now praying that the Chancellor will give an unattributable, indiscreet briefing to 10 journalists and a silent tape recorder. One school of thought is trying to find a scientific basis for when the embarrassment quotient reaches a point where it triggers action by the Government. There was a certain amount of embarrassment on another matter the other day, which I shall not press at the moment. It would be useful for Opposition Members to discover what the embarrassment quotient is, and how we can trigger it precisely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result of severing the link between pensions and earnings is now costing every single pensioner £11 a week, or nearly £600 a year. It is costing a couple more than £900 a year. It will be £1,150 by next April, if both partners are entitled to a pension on their own insurance. Their loss is the national

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
insurance fund's profit. There is almost a precise correlation between the two. The figure that the national insurance fund should now be paying out, if the national insurance contribution had been kept at the 18 per cent, that it previously was, is £5.3 billion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In asking that the amendment be accepted, I return to the final words of the Government press release. They refer to another matter but the words are apposite:
	<br><q><p>"People who defraud social security are stealing money that should be available for the old, the poor and the sick."</p></q>
For "people", one could substitute "the Government." The press release ends with the ringing Churchillian cry,
	<br><q><p>"We are not going to let them get away with it!"</p></q>
The way to stop the Government from getting away with it is to pass the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) was clear about the purpose of the amendment. It is designed, first, to restore the link between current pensions—and other benefits—and earnings, rather than simply to protect them from inflation. Secondly, it is designed to provide for the Treasury supplement, which will meet the extra cost. The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear that I shall advise the Committee to disagree and to vote against the amendment, if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we go down that road, it would cost the taxpayer a great deal of money. Simply to restore the pension link with earnings would cost an extra £3.73 billion in 1988-89 alone. All the other benefits would cost a great deal more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a clear division on this across the Committee, and across the Floor of the House. We believe, that it is better to have a clear and firm commitment that the basic retirement pension and other benefits should be protected against price increases and inflation, and to be able to honour that pledge and deliver it with certainty, so that pensioners know exactly where they are, rather than to go for a high-flown commitment to link pensions with earnings and then be unable to fulfil it—as the Labour Government were unable to do when they were in office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Clare Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister understands that for the last 50 years or more the growth in our standard of living year by year is reflected in an improvement in our earnings.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way to the hon. Lady later, rather than have sedentary exchanges. The growth of other income in old age, which the Government have fostered and encouraged, has led to the remarkable contrast between what has happened to pensioner incomes under this Government and what happened under the previous Government. Under the whole period of Labour Government, the average income of pensioners went up by only 3 per cent., whereas under this Government it has gone up by 23 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just for the record, what is the proportion of pensioners who are dependent on the state pension alone? I thought that it was about half. We need to have those figures on the record.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid that the hon. Lady's figures are substantially wrong. Of newly retiring couples now, 85 per cent, have provision other than the basic state provisions, a figure that is growing steadily. The availability of personal pensions in due course, and the maturing of SERPS, on top of the basic state pension, will increase the total amount of income available to retired people. That—enhanced by the Government continuing to hold down inflation—has already had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on the total standard of living that pensioners are able to enjoy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The figures show that more than half of pensioners now—we all know that people who reach retirement age are living longer—are totally dependent upon the state pension system. Is the Minister saying that we can do nothing for them, and that they will have to die off, until the new pensioners with supporting pensions, as he sees it, come through? That would hold out little hope for half the pensioners in Britain at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree. The reason for introducing our poorer pensioner scheme was precisely because we recognise that a number of pensioners have had their savings destroyed by the inflation of the 1970s, that they have not had the opportunity to build up occupational pensions in the way that people are now able to do and that therefore we need to provide extra help for them. The hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) distorted the reasons why that package was introduced. Anybody who fought the last general election would have been aware of the concern on the doorstep over pensioners in that situation, and the need for extra help in their circumstances. We have moved to help them.

That aside, the overall position of pensioners has improved, is improving, and will continue to improve under the Government's policies. They are not limited to setting the basic level of pension. They include all the other things that make up the standard of living that people in retirement are able to afford. We believe in essence that it is better to give a pledge that we can fulfil, rather than, as the previous government did, to give pledges that they were unable to fulfil, and for pensioners to feel betrayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman made a valid point that, compared with income tax, national insurance contributions are regressive. They are not, however, as regressive as they were when they were introduced, when there was a flat rate. Nor are they as regressive as they were before 1975, when they were linked to earnings, or before 1985, when the reduced rates of national insurance contributions were introduced to help those on lower pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want the Committee to believe that because there is not to be a Treasury supplement to the national insurance fund, which pays the contributory benefits, the taxpayer is in some way opting out of the social security system. The taxpayer will continue to pay £20 billion a year to provide for the non-contributory and income-related benefits to which people are entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is sense, logic and tidiness in having a system whereby the contributions that are made to the national insurance fund pay for the contributory benefits and then the taxpayer pays for the non-contributory and income-related benefits. I cannot say that demographic movements in future years will enable the principle to hold for all time, but for the time being it is a sensible, logical outcome. For the two sets of reasons that I have advanced, I ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Just before the Minister sat down, he said that it was right that people in work should finance the national insurance fund and therefore the contributory benefits. Why, at the scheme's inception, were one third of the costs of unemployment pay and one sixth of pensions and disability allowances financed from general Exchequer funds? In my view—I may have misunderstood the rationale—it has always been an important part of the package that the Exchequer should supplement the national insurance fund. There must be sense in keeping some flexibility. From time to time it may be right, although not necessarily in these circumstances, for the Government to decide that a Treasury supplement is unnecessary in given circumstances. This clause completely closes the door to any future Treasury supplement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the clause had been trying to make easier a situation in which the Government had taken it upon themselves, in the prevailing circumstances not to make a contribution, I should have been much more sympathetic towards the Government. That opportunity is being foreclosed for all time. It is a short term, retrograde step.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The increase in national insurance contributions that the fund has enjoyed recently may enable the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
Government to finance all the contributory benefits from funds available to them; but that may change very quickly. The primary legislation in clause 2 may put the Government in a difficult position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand the rationale for this sudden change. The Minister repeated this morning that the Government have decided that people who are in work should finance contributory benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The kind of benefits that are paid brings into play the argument that was deployed by the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn). The Government have to face the charge that is made against them. I agree that the situation will change in the next century, because retirement provision will change in a variety of ways: people will own their homes and state earnings-related, personal and occupational pensions will be available and will change the circumstances. In the short term, however, a generation of pensioners will suffer severely from being left out of the general increase in wealth that the rest of the country enjoys. By denying the national insurance fund the additional funds that could be made available from the Treasury supplement, the Government are choking off an opportunity to bridge the gap between those who are in receipt of benefits, especially pensioners, on the one hand—whose increases are restricted to changes in the retail price index—and those who enjoy a higher level of increase in earnings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the Social Security Advisory Committee recommended this. I wholly subscribe to its view that the Government should take the opportunity, when extra funds become available, to go a bit over the odds and do a more than they are legally entitled to do in terms of price protection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) presses the amendment to a Division, I shall be a wee bit nervous about passing an amendment that would cost £3.7 billion immediately. I fully understand and support the reasoning behind it, but it would be a fairly drastic financial step to take at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the Government cannot, in all conscience, sit there and say that they will not allow people who are dependent on state retirement benefits to opt in between now and the end of the century, when circumstances will have changed, leading to an inevitable loss in their earnings status, compared with the general wealth of the rest of the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all know that national insurance is an unprogressive tax because it cuts off and ceases to go up in relation to earnings. If benefits have to be funded only from national insurance, relatively more is paid by poorer people. If some subsidy to benefits comes out of tax—which is a little more progressive, though less so under this Government—the better off pay something towards the cost. It is fundamentally a deeply regressive move. Given the surplus of Government funds, we can afford to pay our pensioners a decent rate so that they keep in line with earnings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not making myself clear. I am arguing that we should do precisely that. My only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
caveat was that £3.7 billion, just for the pensioners' increase, is a big step to take, although emotionally and in other ways I accept the argument of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). It is a question of degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is right for the Committee to ask the Government to explain the change and to say why they are legislating to prohibit he possibility of a Treasury supplement. It was unnecessary to go so far, even if they were not continuing the reduction since 1980 of the Treasury supplement from 18 per cent, to the present 5 per cent. There have been no significant changes since 1973, when the Treasury supplement was set at 18 per cent, by statute. It was enshrined in the Social Security Act 1973 that ther should be an 18 per cent. Treasury supplement. However, the Government have suddenly changed their minds. Their only explanation is that people who are in work should shoulder all the costs of contributory benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all the reasons that we have heard this morning, there are severe ramifications to that policy. It does not even begin to look at the arguments about what could be done with the additional money. On subsequent amendments, or on clause stand part, we may go into that in more detail. It is a substantial sum that could be used immediately, perhaps next year, to help pensioners and people on sickness and invalidity benefit, widows' benefit and maternity allowance. Widows in particular are having a very rough deal. That is evident from some of my constituency cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister spoke earlier there was an exchange about the short-term package that has been devised to alleviate the situation next October for the most impecunious people on retirement benefit. Where will that money come from? Will it come from the national insurance fund or from the Exchequer fund? Why should the Government not use the Exchequer fund and the national insurance fund for precisely that sort of contingency? If the Minister has £1.75 billion, he should be able quite properly to make those payments. Pensioners are entitled to payments from the national insurance fund because pensions are a contributory benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I understand the new situation correctly, in future we shall have to rely on one-off votes in the House to make improvements in pensions and benefits. They cannot be financed from the national insurance fund; the funds are not there because the Treasury supplement has been removed. That is a bad move. I cannot understand the rationale behind it or why the Government have decided to cut off and prohibit the possibility of using Treasury supplements in future. I think I am persuading myself and, if the amendment is pressed to a Division, I may well support the official Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall make a modest attempt to swing the hon. Gentleman back in the other direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Committee accepts—and I appreciate that the Committee is divided on this issue—that we should continue to collect national insurance contributions on an earnings-related basis but link the payment of retirement benefits and other
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
contributory benefits to price movements, the fund is in a healthy state. I gave the figures on Second Reading—a surplus of some £2.7 billion for the year 1988-89 and a balance at the end of the year of £9.9 million. The fund will be very healthy; there are no demographic changes to affect it before the end of the century. I believe that it is sensible to make it clear that we have reached the position which I outlined earlier where the contributory benefits can be financed by contributions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms C. Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have learnt, as I am sure the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) has learnt, that in social security few things are for ever. I cannot say that, when the impact of the demographic changes comes early in the next century, the Government of the day may not decide that there is a case for the Treasury supplement. They could deal with it perfectly easily. There are Social Security Bills, as I know to my cost, every Session of Parliament. For the moment, however, the Treasury supplement is not necessary and there is no prospect, at least until the turn of the century, of it becoming necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The poorer pensioner package was financed by the Exchequer because it was an income-related package, specifically to help poorer pensioners. I should have thought that the Committee might agree that in the longer run it was better—because we acknowledge that the standard of living of pensioners as a whole is improving and will continue to improve—that any extra help that we provide should be focused on those who have lost their savings because of inflation, or who were unable to build up the sort of occupational pensions that people retiring today are able to take for granted and who therefore will not be a charge on the national insurance fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) asked why we have moved away from what was introduced in 1948 and prevailed for some time: an accepted Treasury supplement to the national insurance fund. It was done that way—Beveridge and the Labour Government at the end of the second world war agreed to it—because the contributions were flat-rate contributions. They had therefore to be set at a sufficiently low level to be affordable by the majority of the working population, which meant that the books could not be balanced. Now that we have the earnings-related contributions and the benefits linked to inflation, it is possible to do it without the Treasury supplement. We believe that that position will prevail for some time. Therefore, this is a sensible move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do Conservative Members understand the logic of the Government's position? The Government's economic aim is to have very low inflation and the maximum possible increase in earnings. If the Government are successful, that will be achieved. The Minister's objective, which he stated yesterday, to link pensions to rises in prices and not to earnings, will inevitably lead to the the growing impoverishment of pensioners. How can

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is well-trodden ground. That is only so if the sole or major part of retirement income comes from the basic state pension.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is half the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the greatest respect to the hon. Lady, it is not half the people. We are talking of the newly-retiring 85 per cent, with pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to the newly retired. About half of our 11 million pensioners rely entirely on the state pension. We are talking of 5 million people. The Minister cannot wipe them away. Under the plans that he has just proudly declared, they will become increasingly impoverished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that were to happen, when monitoring the standard of living of those pensioners who have not benefited from the maturing of SERPS, occupational pensions and so on, the Government would have to take other action to help them. It would be formidably expensive to meet that need by increasing the basic state pension across the board in relation to earnings. Money would not then be focused on helping the most needy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Due to the policies of this Government, the total income of pensioners has gone up by 23 per cent., compared with 3 per cent, under Labour. Many factors will transform the horizons of the vast majority of pensioners. The growth in owner occupation, for example, will mean that before they retire, many people will inherit their parents' home. That will have a profound effect on what people will be able to afford in their retirement. It would not be a sensible use of resources across the board to link retirement pensions to earnings rather than to prices.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most Committee members will accept our explanation of the Lawson embarrassment bonus. The timing of that bonus was remarkable. It was not announced in the orderly way that one would expect had it been on the back burner for a long time. It did not come in the Autumn Statement or in the uprating statement. It fell out of the sky three weeks after the tape recorder failed to deliver its message, and mendacious reporters delivered a message that was disagreeable to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Although the money will not be paid for over a year, the announcement appeared then. Most Committee members will stick to the theory of the embarrassment factor and the trigger that that pushes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The average figures under Labour, which we accept, and those under the Conservatives are trotted out constantly. The fact is that the real value of basic pensions rose by 20 per cent, under Labour and by just over 2 per cent, under the Conservatives. The position is even worse for those pensioners who will benefit from the Lawson embarrassment bonus. They have not had an increase of 2.1 per cent. If he has been seduced by the Minister, I shall try to win back the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) by pointing out that the amendment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
would not compel the Government to make payments of any specific amount. It is so worded as to encourage those who hold the views of the hon. Gentleman to support us and enable the Government to make good the losses since 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the message much broader than appealing for support from the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood)? It makes an effective appeal to Conservative Members. If we examine the record of both parties on pensioners, it is true, as the Government say, that linking state pensions to average earnings increases the income of all pensioners. This Government's record shows that there has been an impressive increase in the average income of pensioners. But that has resulted from occupational pensions. The increases have gone to those with most, not least, income. A Government who are anxious to target help on those in the greatest need would find the amendment much more attractive than they have so far admitted in today's debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that intervention, and I hope that the optimism of my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) is contagious, as some Conservative Members have now returned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good news when a fund is healthy and the books are in good shape. It is not such good news when that has been achieved by taking money away from pensioners and denying them the increases that they should have been awarded. The other factor is the increase in national insurance from 5 per cent, to 9 per cent.—a point that was not covered at any length by the Minister. That has hit hardest those on low wages and has let off lightly those on sumptuous salaries. People with salaries above £20,000 are doing very well indeed and the proportion of the national insurance burden that falls on them is small. If there is a bonanza for the national insurance fund, we should aim to give a fair deal to those on benefit, including pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister stressed that the general taxpayer is still paying for many benefits. That is well understood and has nearly always been the case, but it does not explain the profound change that is taking place in that a practice which has continued since 1911 is about to be smashed. It has been accepted without question by Governments of every colour, that there is an obligation on us all to help pay those benefits out of general taxation. That practice is well established and recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A pensioner on supplementary benefit in 1978-79 got the long-term scale rate of £19.90 plus, in most cases, a heating addition of about 85p, making a total of £20.75. Many pensioners got additions for other special needs, such as laundry and special diet, but I shall be charitable and ignore those. A pensioner on income support now gets £33.40 plus the pensioner premium of £10.65, making a total of £44.05. From that, he must pay 20 per cent, of his rates—an average of £1.30—and water rates of, say, £1. That leaves him with £41.75 a week. Between November 1978 and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
April 1988, prices rose by 106 per cent, so £20.75 in 1978–79 should have risen to £42.75 in 1988–89. That means that the poorest pensioners—those who qualify for the Lawson embarrassment bonus—are already £1 worse off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fairer test may be the position of pensioners over 80 or the disabled, who get the higher pensioner premium. They will receive an extra £2.40, the same as those who got the supplementary benefit additions for special needs as well as automatic additions of 25p for being over 80. A single pensioner of over 80, who was housebound or seriously ill and claimed the higher rate of heating allowance of £1.70, would have received £21.85 in 1978–79. The equivalent in 1988-89 would be £45.05, but even with a higher pensioner premium, he will now get only £44.15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the two categories of pensioners in greatest need are already £1 worse off while they are waiting for the cornucopia of the Lawson embarrassment bonus to reach them. They have lost £11 a week because of the severance of the link between pensions and earnings, to which we are about to give our imprimatur through the clause. They have also lost an additional £1 a week in real terms. It will not be celebration time for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) is right to say that half the pensioners rely on the basic pension. The figures for newly retired people, which were quoted by the Minister, include many receiving modest SERPS additions, which are tiny in many cases due to the actions of past Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment takes November 1977 as the starting point. We admit that there was a shortfall in the November 1978 benefit uprating, which the Labour Government undertook to make good in 1979. The Conservative party's first uprating in November 1979 honoured that pledge for pensioners, which is why they can claim the miserable 2.1 per cent. Had they not honoured that pledge, their record would have been even more shameful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment because the clause represents a profound, historic change that will help bring back the old, dark, cruel days of the beginning of the century and before. It will do long-lasting, profound damage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of the previous Division, I urge the Government to reconsider the deadlines that the Bill will impose. Amendment No. 3 would remove such a deadline and amendment No. 6 would re-introduce an action date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 2 inserts a clear time limit. We do not know the date when the fund receives the Treasury supplement. If it based on contributions paid, for example, in 1988-89, it seems that that payment would not normally be made until at least the end of that financial year. Contributors would have paid throughout 1988-89 on the understanding that they would be supplemented by the Treasury contribution. The time limit imposed suggests that the supplement can be withdrawn retrospectively and demonstrates an example of Government creative accounting that will break the Government's part of the national insurance contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) mentioned that the DSS recently put out a press release with the banner heading
	<br><q><p>"No Let-Up oh Social Security Fraud".</p></q>
I hope that that also applies to the Department's relationship with its contributors. The time limit should be removed because it is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of clause 2 is that no Treasury supplement will ever be paid again. Amendment No. 6 suggests that it will not be paid in the financial year 1989-90, but that it could, and would, recommence in 1990-91. It would enable the Treasury supplement to continue to be paid in the future, although the Government want to make a break now. We should not build into the bill the possibility of never having a Treasury supplement in the future. Clause 2 not only abolishes the supplement but removes the possibility of ever reintroducing it without primary legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the fund is in a healthy state. I am sure that he will tell us that it will get healthier over the next 10 years. For example, pensions could be frozen. Will pensions be increased in line with earnings? Will contributions be reduced? Will the Department cream off the difference? If that happens, the assumption that income derived from contributors to the fund will always be sufficient to meet its outgoings—an assumption not supported even by Conservative Members, who have expressed concern—may not always be valid.

On Second Reading the hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack) said:
	<br><q><p>"I am aware that, as we approach the end of the century, the demographic table suggests that the number of national insurance payers will decline. At present there are 2.3 national insurance payers per claimant, but by the turn of the century, that figure will have declined to about 1.8 payers per claimant. I hope that the Bill will not be a hostage to fortune and that the national insurance

fund will not run out of money."—	<i>[Official Report,</i> 10 January 1989; Vol. 144, c.763.]</p></q>
There is real, Conservative vision in that contribution, but it breaks with the current trend—the cash-in-now mentality. It reminds me that at the time of the great Fowler review there were fears about what would happen in 2025. The impression was created that, by that date, Britain would be an island of pensioners. All press releases about the Fowler review were dominated by the need to abolish SERPS and encourage people to have private pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out that the figures quoted by the hon. Member for Fylde were wrong. Under present policy, there is little risk of the fund running out of money, even towards the next century. The Government Actuary's estimate, published in the annex to the 1985 Green Paper "Reform of Social Security" pointed out that the number of national insurance contributors per pensioner would fall from 2.3 in 1984-85 to 1.8 in 2025-26 but that almost all that fall would take place after the turn of the century. The reason for the fall is not a decline in the number of contributors—it is expected that there will be more contributors in 2025 than in 1984—but the steep rise in the number of pensioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, we are entitled to ask how the fund will be kept going. The answer is that its income from contributors will rise in line with earnings, while benefits will remain frozen in real terms, rising only in line with prices. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West pointed out, the heart of the Government's approach to this matter is that crucial break between pensions and earnings which we have opposed and will repeatedly oppose. It means that pensioners themselves are paying for the fund by real reductions in their pensions. The notes on clauses are misleading in suggesting that benefits paid out of the fund can be wholly financed by contributions, and so are no longer justification for subsidy by the taxpayer. They do not mention the fact that in practice pensions are being reduced in the process.

A table in the Government Actuary's report on the Social Security Act 1986 showed that on the basis of benefits rising only in line with prices, the contribution rates required in the next century to keep the fund in balance would be lower than in 1986-87, despite the rising proportion of pensioners in the population. However, that would be the case even if, as the Actuary assumed, average earnings rose by only 1.5 per cent, more than prices each year. With a higher growth rate the fund would do better still.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the crucial point is that, to meet the cost of pensions in the next century, the Government, rather than making more money available to the national insurance fund, are ensuring that the average pension is worth less each year as a proportion of average earnings. Erosion of the value of the pension each year in real terms is behind the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, it is not true that the taxpayers are subsidising the fund, as the Minister claimed, because the pensioners are subsidising it. Pensioners have no
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
prospect of participating in the much-vaunted and increased prosperity for the majority of the population. The majority of pensioners, over half of whom are dependent on nothing but the state pension, face a steady decline into poverty in the midst of that much-vaunted affluence. Their pensions are chipped away. Either the clause undermines pensions, or the Government will support our amendment not to close the door to the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that no final decisions have been taken about the future value of contributory benefits, but can he tell us that it will not be frozen indefinitely? He needs to make up his mind before the Bill leaves Committee. He said earlier that, because of demographic movements, he could not say that that would be the case "for all time". I shall check 	<i>Hansard</i> record for today's sitting, but if he does not believe that it will be "for all time" he should make his mind up now. He will be closing the door to the future if the clause is accepted in the form in which it is written.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to think again. He may say in the mean time that more bonuses could be offered. However, if the Government abolish the Treasury supplement in this way, it is not just for one year; it is permanently abolished, without major legislation being brought before Parliament again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may seem strange that Opposition Members are doing no more than urging the Government not to deprive themselves of one of the most simple and straightforward means of paying for a real increase in pensions and other benefits. Our amendment would do nothing more than leave that door open. I hope that the Minister can assure us that he is fully aware of the implications of the clause and can perhaps come some way towards agreeing with our amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Member went over some of the ground that had been covered in earlier amendments. I am not surprised about that. I will not go over the argument again. In response to his final challenge to me, the Government have a pledge to protect the retirement pension against movements in prices. We will fulfill that pledge. In a recent debate by hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham), looking back at the experience of the Labour Government, said that it is all very well to promise the earth and deliver the IMF.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to take rising prices into account when working out the effect on living standards of any group, including pensioners.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are presiding over not just the payment of a single benefit and have to consider the overall impact of Government policy on the standard of living of pensioners, as we do for the rest of the population. The growth of savings and the growth of occupational pensions and all that has occurred under this Government have led to the 23 per cent, rise in living standards against 3 per cent, under the Labour Government, which is what matters to retired people rather than the level of a single benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that, by passing the clause today, as I hope the Committee will, we are making a commitment for the long term. We are including a clause in the Bill which says, in essence, that as the supplement is no longer necessary for the foreseeable future let us get rid of it. If the position changed dramatically a future Government could have a single clause in a social security Bill and bring it back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Committee understands the nature of the adjusting payments which the Opposition suggest should be continued. It involves fine tuning of the social security system. The supplement from the Treasury is paid to the fund weekly on an estimate of what is necessary. Over the following months the books are corrected and the appropriate payments are made in and out. They are quite small. If the amendment were passed we would continue that process of making adjusted payments until 1993. Although over the past three years those payments have normally resulted in a net gain to the national insurance fund, they are not one-way payments. Payments come out of the national insurance fund and go back to the Exchequer. Last year the fund repaid about £19 million in that way. These are relatively small sums of money. In 1985-86, the figure was £30 million and in 1986-87, it was £33 million. It is not right to continue the administrative burden of making these payments when we have decided to end the contribution of the Treasury supplement completely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be fair to remind the Minister when we go on to the new clauses that he has referred to sums of £30 million or so as small?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the context of the national insurance fund which had an end of the year balance of £10.5 billion for 1989-90, it is a small amount of money. The hon. Member is doubtless turning his imagination to ways of exploiting that.

For the reasons that I have outlined, it would not be appropriate to accept amendment No. 3. Amendment No. 6 takes us back to the old question of whether we link to earnings or prices.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to detain the Committee, but it is right to summarise briefly the outcome of our debates on those useful amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unusual—and possibly unique—for the Government to choose to deprive themselves of a source of income by ruling out any Treasury supplement in the future, unless primary legislation is changed. The Government are doing that because of the way that the national insurance fund is built up. They are doing that as an alternative, either to reducing contributions taken from people's salaries, or to paying out those contributions in benefits to retirement pensioners, widows and invalidity pensioners who draw their pensions from the national insurance fund, which is what the people who pay those contributions intend. That is outrageous. The Government want to reduce the amount of income tax taken from people's salaries, but apparently that is not so on national insurance contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we said on Second Reading the proposals are a cheat on national insurance contributors and on those who draw national insurance benefits. We have no doubt that future Governments will regret that the Government have taken this course of action. It places on record the Government's intention to continue to freeze pensions and other benefits in real terms, and to continue to allow the standard of living of pensioners to drop in comparison to the standard of living of those earning. It is just as well that that is on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause makes not the slightest difference to the Government's income. It simply says that, rather than there being a commitment for the Government to move funds from the Exchequer to the national insurance fund, which has strict limits on the purposes for which it can be spent, the money shall remain in the Exchequer so that the Government can decide to what purposes it shall be put. I am happy to stand by the Government's record on raising the overall standard of living for pensioners rather than being obsessed with a single benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.45 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kirkwood</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment has proved very useful because we have rumbled the Government's real problem. The Minister of State said in passing that the £30 million, which go one way one week and another the next, cause too many difficulties and create too many unnecessary jobs for Treasury staff. We have uncovered the real rationale behind the change, which is administrative convenience. That is hopelessly unacceptable and I am struggling to find another reason why the Government have included the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the fears of the hon. Member for Derby, South (Mrs. Beckett) that the clause will herald a move towards selective as opposed to universal benefits. That is undeniable given the history of the national insurance fund and its contributory principle for pensions and sickness. The idea behind the Beveridge scheme was to spread the financial burden horizontally through a lifetime and to help people and their children through periods of unemployment or whenever they needed help. Those principles are liable to be struck a blow if we move away from the principle of contributory benefits and have to go to the Chancellor of the Exchequer—whether or not he has 10 journalists and a tape recorder—to justify every increase on an income-related basis.

	<br><q><p>"(9) Nothing in this section shall result in a reduction of any person's earnings factors which have already been notified to him for a tax year ending on or before 5 April 1988.".</p></q></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 3 is a different kettle of fish from the clauses that we have already debated in that it deals with what most Members of the Committee regard as the rather obscure matter of earnings factors. I hope that it will not be the case with every clause, but I am reminded of some of the debates that we had in 1985. I recall that it was in March that year, while we were debating the Government's main plans for state earnings-related pensions and occupational pension schemes, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer came up with one of his clever wheezes, which was not wholly unwelcome at the time. Although the Government were increasing the general burden of national insurance contributions, there was some mitigation for low-paid workers and gradual phasing-in of the increase of scales for the initial payment of such contributions was introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, it became clear through the usual channels—not the Whips Office, in this case, but other channels—that the Chancellor had not, as is consistent with the principles of Budget secrecy, communicated his clever wheeze to anyone at the Department of Social Security. The DSS Ministers were in the process of introducing very complex pensions legislation which relied on the simple calculation of earnings factors. Then the Chancellor threw a spanner in the works and thoroughly complicated the whole system, so that not only would the paying of contributions be affected, but the calculations of the earnings factors on which those contributions were based. Rumblings were heard—indeed, they reached the ears of Opposition Members—that the DSS found the idea unwelcome and did not know how it was going to cope with implementing it. As has become apparent, it has taken four years for the Department to find a way of dealing with the consequences of the Chancellor's clever little wheeze.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have tabled the amendment because we are not wholly satisfied that the DSS has yet succeeded in adapting the Chancellor's proposal to the social security legislation in a way which will not potentially disadvantage claimants. We may be doing the Government an injustice, but on this occasion we assume that that is not their intention. We fear
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1988-1989V006P0I0044">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
that they may inadvertently, for once, disadvantage people when it comes to the earnings factor on which pensions are calculated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 offers an alternative form of wording for the clause as it stands. Any member of the Committee who has had to handle national insurance and taxation matters for an employee will be familiar with the parallel process relating to earnings factors. The intention is that benefit entitlement should be ascertainable from tables or rules drawn up by the Secretary of State. That process was, and remains, relatively simple from the point of view of employees paying class 1 contributions where that is a single percentage of earnings, so a given amount of contributions can be assumed to correspond to a given amount of earnings. Since the Chancellor had his clever idea in 1985, there have been different contribution rates on different brackets of earnings. Although that may be desirable in itself, it makes it impossible to derive earnings factors as simply as it used to be. That has resulted in numerous amendments to section 13 of the 1975 Act and regulations of considerable complexity which the Committee will be amazed to learn are among the many defective regulations made from time to time by the Department. We believe that the idea of clause 3 is to validate retrospectively that legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of the clause, the Act would be amended so that for any tax year beginning on or after 6 April 1987, the earnings factor will be dealt with as if it is for a sum
	<br><q><p>"equal or approximating to the amount of those earnings".</p></q>
That is an imprecise term. Let us not forget that this is not simply a technical, arcane matter. In the previous debate, the minister praised the Government for the way in which they fund pensions. He knows that we disagree with that to some extent but it is only right that people should have the correct amount of pension for the contributions that they have made—that is what earnings factors are all about. The proposal is that the wording should be "approximating to" those earnings, and just in case the Department still has not got it right—we shall deal with this in a later amendment—subsection 5(a) gives the Secretary of State power to modify what is being done by regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the correspondence of those two proposals means that there is not even a guarantee that earnings factors will approximately correspond to the amount of earnings on which contributions have been paid. If the earnings factors do not corrrespond even approximately, there is a danger that someone could lose all entitlement to what are known as short-term benefits such as unemployment and sickness benefit and might also lose part of his pension entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
As I have said, the phrase "in general" was in the original section and may not have been needed at that time but as we have already shown, the method of calculating earnings factors then was simpler and more reliable. Now, because of the complexities that have been introduced, it is more important for people to be able to rely on the Secretary of State's tables giving the right answer. The phrase "in general" is simply not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 8 seeks to impose a slightly more definite requirement on the Secretary of State to find a method to calculate earnings factors that does not involve an unacceptable risk of depriving people of the benefits that their contributions should have earned. Even if the previous amendment were not accepted and the phrase "in general" remained in the Bill, the effect of this amendment would be that earnings factors would have to be at least equal to the earnings on which contributions were paid. We are seeking to establish some kind of underpinning or guarantee that people will have at least the earnings factor for which they have contributed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government could pick out one amendment and say, "That one is acceptable although others are not." Under amendment No. 8 the words "in general" would remain in the Bill and it would still allow the Secretary of State power to modify by regulations. However, if the discussion of this package of amendments led the Government to consider the phrasing of the clause, that would be a good thing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9 deals with the power to make regulations that impose a limit on a person's earnings factor for any year. We are always wary of giving to Governments open-ended powers that could be used either in the way in which the Government say that they are intended to be used or in quite another way. The progress of this Government over the past 10 years has given us cause for alarm—alarm that at one time would have been shared by both sides of the Committee. I find it not the least disturbing of the developments over the past 10 years that Conservative Members these days are apparently quite happy to give their Government—or any future Government—unlimited powers to make up later legislation as they go along and even make it up by regulations that are not legal under the Act in question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
