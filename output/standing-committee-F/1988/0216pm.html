	<p>	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are discussing the following amendments: No. 120, in page 7, line 37, after "matters", insert "including work-related expenses".

No. 143, in page 7, line 41 at end insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister for Social Security (Mr. Nicholas Scott)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. Before we adjourned this morning, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) produced a document which, because of the way she presented it appeared to be a bombshell. When I glanced at it, I realised that it was a storm in a tea cup. Now that I have read it thoroughly I know that it is a mere zephyr, unlikely to disturb a tiny feather on the surface of a pool.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document was circulated to management in the employment service on 20 and 21 December, immediately after the First Reading of the Bill, so that managers would be able to respond to any queries about the Bill that their staff might raise. All the matters are subject to what Parliament decides, but it was sensible of the headquarters of the employment service to inform their managers. It has no relevance to the work of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying the matter raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). Members of the Committee may refer to the document but only insofar as it is relevant to the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Clare Short 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Ladywood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. The document's relevance is for each member of the Committee to decide. The Department of Employment has been more frank with its staff than the Minister has been with the Committee. That is shocking. We have already reached the stage when Members of Parliament are not respected, and it now seems that Ministers of the Crown are not respected
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
either. The Department of Employment is more frank with its staff than with the Minister of another Department who is doing its dirty work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the forthright comments of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). As yet, I have onerous responsibilities only for this Committee. However much I would wish to do so, I cannot take responsibility for Ministers or Departments of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been frank with the Committee and I listened to the arguments advanced. The document is out of date, not least because of my concessions in responding to reasonable arguments in Committee. I have disregarded the unreasonable ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Margaret Beckett 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Derby, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will concede that while he may have been frank with the Committee, he has also been economical. At our last sitting, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) pressed the Minister to say why six to 12 weeks had been decided on. I suggested in an intervention that the reason might be that people would not by then have re-qualified for unemployment benefit, on which the Minister made a sotto voce comment. The document is more frank. It states that that is precisely why that trial period has been chosen. The Minister did not mislead the Committee about that but he did not tell us either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady made a good point, but it is not relevant to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion. I said that it might be helpful for the necessary work expenses to be dealt with in regulations. We shall consider that carefully when they are drafted. I commend amendment No. 119 to the Committee and urge my hon. Friends to support. I hope that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) will ask leave to withdraw amendment No. 120.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for not having noticed that amendment No. 143 is grouped with amendments Nos. 119 and 120, but I am grateful to you, Mr. Winterton, for pointing that out. That is why I did not try to catch your eye immediately after my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie), but I shall speak to the amendment now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143 deals with the definition of "employment". At our sitting on Thursday, we asked the Minister why the Department wished to amend the definition of "employment" in existing legislation. The Minister gave us his usual long and courteous reply which I freely admit that, at that hour, went in one ear and out the other, and I did not take in its full implications. We tabled amendment No. 143 to enable us to return to the subject because, on more mature consideration and having read the Minister's comments, it is not yet wholly plain. We now seek further clarification of the Government's intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0344">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
The notes on clauses say that the regulation-making powers in clause 10 will
	<br><blockquote><p>"enable regulations to be made to ensure that a claimant is treated in the same way for both unemployment benefit and income support."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend dealt with that matter. But on Tuesday, we asked why the Government were considering using that power to widen the scope of the definition of "employment", and it is not wholly plain to me whether that is affected by amendment No. 119 which the Minister proposes to accept. The Minister talked about the dividing line between part-time and full-time work which, as is consistent with income support and family credit regulations, will be fixed at 24 hours a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. May I help the hon. Lady? If amendment No. 119 is put—the Government say that they are prepared to accept it—amendments Nos. 120 and 143 would fall because they would not be applicable and would not make sense. Clearly, I do not wish to prevent the hon. Lady from speaking to amendment No. 143 because I have selected it, but I hope that she realises that if she wishes the Question to be put on that amendment, the Government may have to think again about amendment No. 119.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Winterton. However, until we have decided what is to happen to amendment No. 119,1 shall use this opportunity to discover more about the Government's intentions. If what the Minister said means that no one will be disqualified for either refusing or leaving a job which involves less than 24 hours of work a week, that will be most welcome. In a recent case, someone was disqualified for the full 26 weeks—the Minister is sure that that is not the norm, although he has no evidence to support his statement—for leaving a job which involved fewer than two and a half hours a week and for which he earned the princely sum of £5.50.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But however part-time work is defined, it is still not clear why the definition of "employment" is to be widened to include part-time or temporary employment. Is it because, under the present law, some people who refuse or leave part-time or temporary jobs cannot be disqualified, and the Government want them to be disqualified? If so, what type of case would be affected, if someone working only two and a half hours a week now can be disqualified? Or—I hope that this is an unworthy suspicion, but it would not be the first time—is it because the Minister has been told that the way in which the present law is applied is illegal? He therefore has to redefine "employment" to make it legal. If that is so, have people been unlawfully disqualified? Will they get back their benefit? How many people are involved? Is there another reason for widening the definition of "employment"? If so, will the Minister be kind enough to tell us what it is?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go over the ground. As the hon. Lady said, she had perhaps not taken in fully what I said. Although the word "widen" is used
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
in the notes on clauses, in effect, the definition is being narrowed—[Hon. Members: "Oh!"] If the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) reads what I said at the previous sitting, he will note that we use the word "widen" in the sense of expanding the definition; but in practice it means that temporary, and especially part-time, work will qualify only if more than 24 hours a week are involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the existing system, offers of part-time and temporary work for any number of hours can be made and that could be used to disqualify people. In essence, we are saying that if the offer is for fewer than 24 hours a week, that could not be used to disqualify anyone from benefit. Surely the Opposition would welcome that proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that what the Minister said is wrong. When we discussed the matter before, he said that many people on benefit were seeking part-time work. A few may manage to get through. However, a search for part-time work is a restriction of availability. People will be regarded as not available for work if they restrict the hours which they are willing to work. That relates to the earlier point. Some people want and seek part-time work. It is good that they can get such work if it suits their responsibilities and needs. But it is not good to force those who want and need the income from full-time work to accept part-time employment. It is not good for them or their income. We are deeply worried about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that without the Bill and under existing procedures people can be made to take part-time work. But that would happen in only a very few cases when it was what someone wanted. Existing legislation provides that employment must be suitable. I have here somewhere the advice to officials who interpret that provision—it includes the number of hours for which someone wants "suitable employment". Currently, we have a definition of "suitable employment" which prevents the system from requiring someone to take a part-time job if he wants a full-time one. But with the abolition of the word "suitable" and the concept associated with it, that safeguard will be removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We worry that the Government will use the Bill's powers to force people who need the income from full-time work to take part-time jobs and that they will end up being extremely poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we last discussed the issues raised by the amendment—I assure you that my remarks are in order, Mr. Winterton—the Minister said that we should not worry. He dismissed the words in the notes on clauses. But I do not accept that. Those notes are clear; the Government intend to treat part-time and temporary employment as satisfactory offers of employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, this is a Department of Employment Bill fronted by the Department of Social Security. The Minister may be doing his best, but no doubt the strategy behind the Bill does not come from his Department. When he is less than clear with us, that is probably because he was not involved in thinking out the strategy and is carrying the bag or doing the job for someone entirely different. But no doubt
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0345">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
officials or strategists in the Department of Employment, who are busy encouraging low pay and so on, realised what would happen if they forced people into work of fewer than 24 hours a week. Without the Minister saying what he did the other day, that would have been done under the Bill. It would have meant that people who received relatively large benefits because they had several dependent children could have been forced off a benefit of, say, £150 into a part-time job which paid £45. The Government probably thought, "Oh dear. This will blow it all for us. It would be so crude and intolerable that the country would go mad. We shall be embarrassed. We must do something about it." So, they decided to ensure that people with dependants would not be forced into a job of so few hours that they would not be eligible for family credit. Therefore, the Minister said, the regulation-making powers would be used to ensure that no one would be forced to take a job of fewer than 24 hours. The reason is that people with dependants would be entitled to family credit and the Government would not have the embarrassment of deliberately slashing a family's income to such a level that it could not survive under the powers in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That teaches us many things. Had the Minister not made that provision, people would have been forced into jobs of less than 24 hours' duration. Without it, that was implicit Family credit is a large state subsidy that is paid, in effect, to inefficient employers. It is a bad way to run an economy and bad for its future. There are the additional problems of low take-up. The Bill provides that people who are ineligible for family credit can be forced to take a job for 24.5 hours a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department seems not to have telephoned the Birkenhead job centre recently. We have talked about jobs that were advertised there. We discovered that there was a 38-hour cleaning job paying less than £1 an hour. Let us be clear that anyone can be forced to take that type of job for as little as 24.5 hours. A person who is entitled to family credit will at least receive it if he manages to take up his entitlement and will not become impoverished, but, let the person without entitlement to family credit beware. Such a person will be forced into work at any rate of pay because the Bill makes it clear that there will be no bottom line and that people can be forced to take a job. If they refuse the job because of the rate of pay, that is not considered sufficient cause and they have proved themselves to be unavailable for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister made the announcement, he confirmed all our worst fears. The Government have to ensure that people in the position which I have described receive family credit, and they have to go for the 24-hour minimum. But it has been demonstrated that people will be forced into part-time work although they need, and are seeking, full-time work, and there will be no minimum hourly rate. People will be forced into an ever-reducing rate of hourly income because of the powers taken in the Bill. The document that was circulated to the Department of Employment confirms that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
The Bill is about forcing people into part-time work instead of full-time work. This means that many people will become impoverished. We must remember at all times that the Government were not even willing to accept an amendment that would have provided that no one would be forced to take a job that paid less than the benefit to which they would otherwise be entitled. Therefore people without dependants who are not entitled to family credit could, as the Bill is drafted, be forced to work for less than the fairly miserable benefit which a single person could claim. The Minister's use of regulation-making powers means exactly that. In some instances, citizens will be even poorer than when they receive benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will respond only briefly because the hon. Lady's assertions do not stand up to scrutiny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me make it clear that part-time work will not usually be offered to someone who is seeking full-time work unless no full-time work is available. It is perfectly possible, even under the present provision relating to suitable employment—that is to say, the expectations should not be less favourable than usual in the normal provisions for a given area of employment—that a person would be offered part-time employment for any number of hours and, if he refused it, would be disqualified from benefit. This provision, which, understandably, is linked to family credit provisions, will be limited to jobs of more than 24 hours. I am puzzled that the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) cannot see that, and that she does not welcome it with open arms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister assures us that we need not worry because no person will be offered a part-time job if a full-time job is available. I believe him because I do not think that he or his Department would dream of doing that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, we know what has taken place in the economy since 1983, when some new jobs began to be generated. There were nearly 1 million jobs, but they were overwhelmingly part time. That is the way things are. The new jobs are part-time jobs. Some of the women doing them welcome the opportunity, although too many are lowly paid. Men seeking full-time employment would not welcome being forced into part-time work, but that is our worry. There is an increasing number of part-time jobs available which do not suit those who are registered as unemployed because, overwhelmingly, they are people who need, and seek, full-time work. The Minister's assurance is worth nothing because full-time jobs are not available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that under existing legislation and regulations, people can be classed as unavailable for work if they refuse a part-time job when they seek full-time work. The Minister may be able to illustrate a few individual cases but, as the law and regulations are structured, they do not generally apply. I have some evidence of this. Anyone who considers the definition of "suitable employment" would have to confirm that it covers hours and income that are appropriate to the person who is applying for a job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0346">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
The following advice is given to new claimants' advisers by the Department of Employment—the relevant Department—when a person's availability is questioned?
	<br><blockquote><p>"If a client declines to go after a job which appears suitable, eg, occupation, hours, wages, location are consistent with the details entered on the UB671, and fails to offer an acceptable reason, consider refusing suitable employment action… Inform the client that benefit will be suspended … However, a refusal to consider a particular vacancy may not necessarily lead to RSE action".</p></blockquote>
The point is that Department of Employment officials are advised in their own handbook about how to use their powers to question a person's availability. It is drawn to their attention that hours and wages are two considerations, and that hours and wages have to be in line with what the person is seeking for his availability to be able to be questioned. A person looking for a full-time job who is offered a part-time job may wish to take it. People often do, and increasingly people are doing two part-time jobs. They are free to make the choice, but they are not forced to take a part-time job. Under existing law, benefit cannot be taken away from people who are genuinely seeking full-time work when the only work available is part time. I am sure that the Minister does not wish to mislead the Committee, but that is what he is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill will transform present practice, as his comments confirm. The very fact that a regulation must be laid stating that the Government will not force someone into fewer than 24 hours' work a week and end his entitlement to family credit means that the past is scrapped and that in future people will be forced, under threat of loss of benefit, to take part-time employment which will not give them sufficient income on which to live. That is the reality, and nothing the Minister has said gives us hope that things will be different. He could give a firm assurance that he will set out in regulations the Government's commitment on hours of work so that anyone who seeks, and is available for, full-time employment will not be found unavailable for work if offered a part-time job. If he means that, will he rise and say so, so that we may continue with other issues? If not, our analysis will have been proved correct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we have had an interesting little debate. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) is entirely right in saying that, despite the Minister's assurance, as the law remains people who seek full-time employment could still be pushed into part-time work because that is all that is available. For the second time there is a change from that which appears in the notes on clauses, which say clearly that the regulation-making power may be used to widen the scope of the definition. The notes then make two reservations to which I shall return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong not to place on record that when the Minister says that he does not understand why Opposition Members are confused, he is being less than fair and is showing that he has not read the record or listened to himself. At our previous sitting he said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The phrase in the notes on clauses which uses the word 'widen' uses it in a different sense from that which I used when responding to the hon. Lady. Then I said that we were trying to restrict rather than widen the definition."</p></blockquote>
The explanation is not very clear, is it? The Minister continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It will cover not only full-time employment, but make it clear that it also covers part-time employment".</p></blockquote>
The Minister went on to define the use of 24 hours of work and said that the provision was
	<br><blockquote><p>"a genuine effort to restrict the definition of part-time work".— 	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 14 February 1989; c. 530–1]</p></blockquote>
We are in this miasma because the regulation— making power is likely to be used in the reverse direction from that implied in the notes on clauses. There appears to be a concession from the Government although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood said, it is not so great a concession that it makes the clause welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An interesting light has been cast on the Government's use of full-time work. I think that the Minister is saying that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood identified clearly, the Government are nervous about claimants being disqualified from the benefit against the test of whether they are willing to go on record as saying that they will accept a job of less than 24 hours a week. No offer has to be made. The Government are worried that people would consider it unreasonable to disqualify a claimant from benefit because he or she would not take a job that offered fewer than 24 hours' work a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear also that the Minister and the Department share my view that in other circumstances 24 hours would not be considered full-time work. He is saying that there are two definitions of part-time work. One is fewer than 24 hours' work, which is considered such a small amount that even under the present regime the Department will not allow it to be used to disqualify people from benefit. The slightly more acceptable form of part-time work is over 24 hours. Nevertheless, it is full-time work for the purposes of family credit. Moreover, that definition is used to disqualify a household from receiving income support if one member is held to be in full-time work, even though the household's total income falls below income support levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also proper full-time work which, in another age, we might call suitable work. It might even be so defined in the legislation. I think that that is what the Minister is saying. On Tuesday's sitting we went round in circles, partly because we leapt from one definition of part-time employment to another.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It has just been explained that there are three sorts of part-time work—part-time work, real part-time work and proper part-time work. This afternoon we heard that to Conservative Members "widen" means "narrow", "encourage" means "persecute", "exceptional" means "unique" and "widen your horizons" means "lower your standards". If we had such a glossary we might find that we were speaking the same language.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have more confidence in the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) if we could be certain that the glossary of definitions would remain the same. The notes on clauses are a glossary of a sort. They are meant to explain what the Bill means, but the Bill's meaning apparently changes from one week to the next. My hon. Friend has made a helpful suggestion which I am sure the Minister will consider, but I fear it may not be as helpful as we would wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to amendment No. 120 and the question whether work-related expenses—we discussed that subject this morning and I fear that the Minister is becoming heartily tired of it—might form good cause for rejecting a proposal or offer of work. The Minister said this morning that officials could take account of work-related expenses when appropriate and that they would not send people after jobs if work expenses would take an unduly high proportion of their earnings. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley pressed the Minister to say whether the level of remuneration meant gross or net pay. The Minister replied that he meant take-home pay, which most would regard as meaning net pay. He said that it might be helpful if the regulations listed the expenses that could be taken into account. That leaves several questions to be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9(2) states that, in deciding whether someone has good cause for refusing a job,
	<br><blockquote><p>"There shall be disregarded any matter relating to the level of remuneration".</p></blockquote>
How then can adjudication officers take into account take-home pay? Is the Minister saying that the Bill does not mean what it says? Is he having second thoughts about clause 9(2)? Is the Department proposing to amend it? If not, the Minister has no grounds for saying what he said this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can adjudication officers judge whether work expenses will take an unduly high proportion of earnings if they are told to disregard any matter relating to the level of earnings? If work expenses are to be taken into account, will they include child-care costs for single parents? Single parents do not have to be available for work to claim income support but they must be available for work to claim unemployment benefit. They can be disqualified from claiming unemployment benefit for refusing a job offer. The Minister's answer to my question will be important to lone parents who may not have exhausted their unemployment benefit entitlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only way in which any matter relating to the level of remuneration, including work expenses, can be taken into account is by making regulations to that effect under clause 9(2). That brings us back to the document which the Minister claimed was of so little importance. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We do not expect to use the Regulation-making powers".</p></blockquote>
Which is it? Is the Minister telling the Committee that despite the Bill, which appears to rule out all questions relating to the level of remuneration, the Government intend to use the powers so that work expenses can be taken into account, or is the document correct in saying that they do not intend
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
to use the regulation-making powers? Is the Department of Employment aware of the way in which the Department of Social Security believes that the legislation will work? If the Department of Employment thinks that the regulation-making powers are riot to be used, what confidence can we have in the way in which adjudication officers will use powers which might put flesh on the bones of the Minister's remarks this morning?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your protection, Mr. Winterton. When the Bill first set out on its path— when it had First Reading and the briefing took place at the Department of Employment—it was not expected that the powers would be used. But I listened to all the arguments in Committee and concluded that it would be sensible to use the regulations for this purpose and I informed the Committee of that. We shall introduce regulations under clause 9(2) although I cannot specify how they will be worded. I hope that the Opposition will grasp at that rather than be niggardly about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we are extremely grateful for anything that we can scrape from the Government, however charmingly offered.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I tried to explain this morning, we shall endeavour to incorporate in regulations the concept of work expenses. How they are defined and what is included is as the hon. Lady win understand, a complex matter. Some work expenses are clear, for example, clothing and tools that are necessary for a

	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
job. Others, such as child care and travel to work, are more difficult to define. However, I shall do my best to reflect that aspect in the regulations which set out the other factors in the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand that a form of words must be found to cover all the concepts. Perhaps I may press the Minister also to include in those regulations a provision for allowing someone to refuse a job if the remuneration is so low that it would be unreasonable to require him or her to take it? Under the regulations, the Minister has the power to do that. Will he undertake to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That, I cannot do because it is one of the fundamentals of this group of clauses and I cannot breach that principle. But without breaching that principle, I have tried to respond as helpfully as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a fundamental point. The definition of employment.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Includes any trade, business, profession, office or vocation."</p></blockquote>
but it does not state whether that must be part time or full time. It could be full time or part time of any number of hours. We want to amend that definition so that those phrases can only apply if the hours worked are 24 a week or more. That is a helpful and not a negative approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Minister because I intended to mention this earlier. Am I right in saying that, although the Minister has made a concession about part-time employment, the Bill's provisions could still be used against the test of employment which might be temporary?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie: 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Sheffield, Heeley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be honest with the Committee. I told the Minister during the lunch break that if he wanted to be generous he could accept amendment No. 120. There is perhaps a little devilment in the Minister if he accepts amendment No. 119 to destroy, to all intents and purposes, amendment No. 120.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition still have doubts about what will happen. I assume that I may tell my constituents, whether male or female, that if full-time jobs are no longer available, unless they take a job for 24 hours a week at 90p an hour, they will lose benefit. That, as I understand it, is what the Minister says. It is on the understanding that there are no full-time jobs for steeplejacks, and so on. As I said, we still have doubts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is delightful to have convinced the Minister— even if it has taken us three days in Committee to do it—that there is a pig's ear between clauses 9 and 10. The Minister is not really being generous. He has accepted that an anomaly exists and then generously said that he is prepared to concede amendment No. 119. That is fine by us, although I should prefer to have amendment No. 120 accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has conceded amendment No. 119, and said that he will consider the regulations. Will he look at the regulations relating to clause 9 or clause
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
10? If he is going to do us another favour, we should prefer him to look at clause 9, which is much more restrictive than clause 10. Will the Minister do that and come back to us on Report?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The good cause regulations will be under clause 9. We see no necessity to replicate them under clause 10, so I shall consider them in the context of clause 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birkenhead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for being late for our proceedings, Mr. Winterton. I arrived as the Minister was saying, almost as though he was making a concession, that the Government were linking the part-time ruling to 24 hours so that people could qualify for family credit. In that case, why does not the Minister go the whole hog and let generosity, for once, seep out of his ample character? He could give a guarantee that people will not be pushed into jobs which pay less than they can claim in benefit, after all the qualifications for means-tested benefits and expenses for work have been taken into account. The Minister says that he cannot do that. Is it because he has put the idea up and if he has, who to, and what was their response, or is he doing this totally off his own bat without asking other members of the Government their views?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall reply briefly, because I have explained the position to the Committee so often. It has been clear for a considerable number of years, under both Conservative and Labour Governments, that there are circumstances where people can be required to take a job—or disqualified from benefit if they do not—at a level of pay below what they are entitled to claim in benefit. I accept that there are arguments for moving forward on these matters, but, as I have already explained a number of times, I do not feel able to go that far in the context of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The difference is that the Bill removes the word "suitable" and changes the ground rules. We are asking the Minister for an undertaking in view of this new situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said on Second Reading that I was not here to defend or apologise for the actions of previous Labour Governments. It has been too much of a sport for Labour Members to attack previous Labour Governments. A Labour Government introduced the four-week rule which threw people off benefit after four weeks and committed one third of a million unskilled men to what this Government would call the "labour market" but what studies show was something very different. I condemned the measure then and I condemn it now. I am not trying to hide behind the actions of previous Labour Governments. The electorate found us wanting in many respects and dismissed us from office. Surely at some stage the albatross will be allowed to drop from our necks, so that we can consider issues more openly and fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are changing the ground rules. Previously, there was a safeguard when commissioners made their decision in that people could plead the word "suitable" in respects of jobs that they were offered. Given that that safeguard is now being abolished and that the Government have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0349">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>589</span>
changed tax and benefit levels, why will the Minister not give us a guarantee, or at least take the idea away, consult with colleagues and come back at a later stage?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether I can accept any point from the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field).

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order now, Mr. Winterton.

The matter raised by the hon. Member for Birkenhead is political, and therefore not for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 63, in page 7, line 41, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(3) A person who is treated as available for employment under regulation 9(1) (c) of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987 shall be treated as actively seeking employment for the purposes of section 20(3) (d) (i) of the 1986 Act.".</p></blockquote>
Is that another development in newspeak? It now seems that "Aye" means "No" and "No" means "Aye". We must come to terms with that new language. The Government are mangling not only the social security system but the language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is of considerable importance because it involves the precious 21-hour rule, which has been used productively by many people to great benefit to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To set the background, I shall quote from 	<i>The Guardian</i> today, which contains a heartwarming story about Tiny Rowland, whose salary has climbed to more than £1 million a year. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Roland 'Tiny' Rowland, the managing director and chief executive of Lonrho, joined the ranks of millionaire' British salary earners after a 54 per cent, pay rise last year".</p></blockquote>
There is another example of newspeak in 	<i>The Guardian;</i>
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Pay skilled young more, says Baker".</p></blockquote>
The first line of the article says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Employers should pay less to unskilled young people".</p></blockquote>
To pay skilled people more, we do not actually pay them more—we pay unskilled workers less. Therefore, relatively, their position improves. We are up against such brave newspeak. It is a wonderful article and an amazing confession about the Government's thinking. Bigger pay differentials, or paying them less money, is the best way to encourage young people to stay at school or college after 16. But in the case of Tiny Rowland, the opposite applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same group of much maligned young people has found some respite in the 21-hour rule. I am not sure whether it was intended to work in the way that it does but many young people are taking advantage of it. The purpose of this modest amendment is to ensure that unemployed people who are engaged in part-time study under the 21-hour rule are not forced to give up their studies because of the "actively seeking employment" test. I am rather anxious about the junior Minister who is about to leave. He seems to be in some danger. As far as I can remember he did not speak at all on clauses 9 or 10, and we have been considering them for at least a week. That is an entire week in which he had not been actively seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 21-hour rule applies only to unemployed people on income support, which thus excludes the Minister, who have been on benefit or YTS for at least three months and who are prepared to terminate their studies as soon as a suitable job becomes available. That is a small group of people who have lost out in many other ways but who have wisely taken courses which last for 21 hours a week. It is marvellous training for them and a springboard into full or part-time employment. No member of the Committee would deny that it is beneficial for everyone that so many people follow courses under the 21 -hour rule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "suitable" will presumably be removed from the regulations as soon as the Bill comes into force. People are now allowed to study for up to 21 hours a week without the risk of losing their benefit on the grounds that they are not available for employment. Unless specific provision is made to exempt them from the "actively seeking employment" test, an adjudication officer might well decide that the time devoted to the course was incompatible with actively seeking employment. All the courses that I have come across involve a considerable amount of unsupervised study, such as reading around the subject and practical activities outside which are intended to ease people into the job market. Many courses are entirely different and are seen to be non-vocational. They do not necessarily aim at a particular job but are still a worthwhile way of spending the 21 hours a week.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the ironies of the present position is that people who seek a qualification, especially a vocational qualification that would enhance their employment prospects, are knocked off the 21-hour rule on the ground that they will not be willing to give up their studies when a job becomes available.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0350">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
There is a catch-22 which prevents them from doing some courses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to tread too far into that area as it is one of the contradictions. There has been no recognition of the value of the courses. The way that the 21-rule has been interpreted by adjudication officers and others has been more sensible than the regulations possibly suggest. I do not want to go too far into that area in case we jeopardise many of the worthwhile courses that are available. The rule was intended to apply to non-vocational courses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister, in his expansive mood, will accept the amendment and exempt from the new test anyone who is considered available for work under the 21-hour rule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I doubt whether the Committee will be unduly surprised that I cannot accept the amendment. I hope that the Opposition, after hearing my explanation, will be prepared to withdraw it. If not, I must advise my hon. Friends to vote against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intention of the 21-hour rule is to distinguish between unemployed who are committed to employment and those who are committed to education. A "21-hour" student must be first and foremost unemployed and seeking to return to employment, but must be using his time usefully to further his education in the meantime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once that concept has been grasped, one can accept that it would be inconsistent to relieve such a person of the duty to seek work actively. He is unemployed and hoping to find work but is using his time by preparing himself for a more profitable and useful return to the employment market. In that way, he could be regarded as similar to the voluntary workers, whom we discussed under clause 7. In both cases, the person should have an opportunity in any week to take appropriate steps to find work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 31 January I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I see no reason why someone who is engaged in voluntary work, training or education cannot also fulfil the criteria that I outlined on actively seeking work. I do not see why looking at newspaper vacancies, applying for jobs, investigating the local labour market and actively seeking work cannot go hand in glove with the three activities that I mentioned. After all, they do not go on 18 hours a day. They will take up only limited parts of the day and the other hours can be spent actively seeking work"— 	<i>[Offical Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 31 January 1989;c. 200.]—</p></blockquote>
or rather satisfying the "actively seeking work" condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will say that to conduct a course of study is as effective a way of preparing oneself for employment as writing letters to employers and registering with employment agencies, but I see no reason why people cannot do both. The regulations must be able to sift out those who are not seeking work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I shall consider the proposition carefully. Any provision must be tightly drawn, but I am sympathetic to the idea of ensuring that the study element is taken into account within a pattern of actively seeking work. As long as someone was doing a certain amount against the normal test of actively
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
seeking work, he would be regarded as enhancing that activity if he were also studying. Having heard me say that, the Committee will understand that it is not an easy area. But if the amendment is withdrawn, I am prepared to think carefully how it could be reflected in the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we discussed this matter with respect to unemployment benefit under clause 9, the Minister said something similar to what he said today. In this instance I believe his assurances and hope that he will not try to reduce the number of people who currently manage to study under the 21-hour rule. I consider that extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When 16 and 17-year-olds' entitlement to benefit was abolished, it was tragic that about 30,000 of them were prevented while on benefit from studying and thus enhancing their future opportunities. I understand that the recent study by the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education estimates that about 130,000 people are currently studying under the 21-hour rule. The Government often speak of a non-dependency culture, and I am in favour of one, although we may differ in our idea of what that may mean. This is a pure example. If people live on benefits because they cannot get a job, they should be encouraged and applauded if, despite their difficulties and low incomes, they study to improve their abilities and their employability. I am grateful to the Minister for taking that seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could do better than we do now. The interpretation of the rule varies. Some local offices belittle the courses that people can take under the 21-hour concession. If people aspire a bit higher to a course that will involve a qualification, they are told, "There is an exam later, therefore we do not believe that you would be willing to take a job if one became available." In areas such as Cleveland, unemployment is so high that it is unlikely that suitable jobs will become available. People face a catch-22 and are driven into a lower level of course than that of which they are capable.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not want to mislead the hon.

I know of several long-term unemployed people who entered courses—some of which were practical such as motor cycle maintenance, while others were purely academic. Courses offer greater recreation and rebuilding of the confidence of young unemployed people than a period of merely seeking work and going through the lacerating period of being rejected repeatedly. I accept the Minister's comments. He understands our arguments. I hope that some way can be found to put them into legislation, or at least into regulations.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 118 would reduce the income support deduction in voluntary unemployment cases from 40 per cent, to 20 per cent, of single person's benefit rate. It is important for us to understand the percentages in cash terms. For a claimant aged 25 or over, it means reducing the deduction from £13.95 a week to £7 a week at 1989–90 benefit rates. At present there is provision for a 20 per cent, deduction, but it applies only when a member of the family is pregnant or seriously ill. In practice, many of the people who should benefit from the 20 per cent, rather than the 40 per cent, provision do not do so because they are not aware of their entitlement. In all other cases, the 40 per cent, reduction applies automatically and there is no provision for mitigating it on grounds of hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
Amendment No. 121 would have a similar effect. It would reduce the deduction to 20 per cent., but only in particular categories of cases. If I go into the history of the suggestion, the case for the Government to take action will become overwhelming. In the debate on 7 February, on clause 9, the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I understand the hon. Lady's point that there is a difference between deducting 40 per cent, for six weeks—as all Governments have done—and for six months."—	<i>[Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 7 February 1989; c. 367.]</p></blockquote>
He was wrong, but I am sure that he did not know that he was wrong. All Governments have done nothing of the sort. Until 1971, a much smaller deduction was made by the Supplementary Benefits Commission under its discretionary powers. The standard deduction was then 75p a week—not 40 per cent., but 13 per cent, of the single householder rate at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1971, the Conservative Government replaced the discretionary 75p deduction, which the Supplementary Benefits Commission considered adequate for its purposes, with the mandatory deduction of 40 per cent, of the single person's rate, or £2.30 at 1971 benefit rates. The Opposition—there we were again—tabled an amendment to the effect that the deduction should not be made where it would cause hardship and the then Minister gave an undertaking that the Commission would use its discretionary powers to prevent hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, the commission issued instructions to its officers setting out a wide range of cases in which they were to look out for possible hardship. They included sickness, pregnancy, high rent or mortgage payments, children in the family and people with a history of low-paid employment. Even in those cases a deduction was to be made, but at the previous level of 75p a week. That list—the effort to prevent hardship and describe the categories that would otherwise suffer hardship—formed the basis of the provisions of the 1980 supplementary benefit regulations. But the regulations treated hardship cases much more severely. While the commission was then making deductions of only £1 a week in such cases, the regulations increased that to 20 per cent, of a single person's scale rate—£4.24 instead of £1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequence of putting the hardship categories in regulations was that, for the first time, most of the cases to which the lower rate of deduction applied began to be identified, and the number of hardship cases rose rapidly. That was not what the Government had intended, so in 1983 the hardship provisions were virtually abolished. That is interesting, is it not? The Government do not want to cause hardship, they make special arrangements for hardship, then they get much more hardship than they thought they would get so they abolish the category of hardship. The list drawn up by the commission in 1971 and reproduced in the 1980 regulations was reduced to the only two categories that we have now—pregnancy and serious illness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The history until 1971 was that a relatively small discretionary deduction was made under Governments of both parties. That is just to correct the Minister. I am sure that he believed it when he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0352">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
said that all Governments had done it, but the story that I am putting in front of him now is rather different. In 1971 the deduction was relatively small—75p—and from 1971 to 1980 there was a much bigger deduction—40 per cent, of a single person's rate, but with discretion to make only a very small deduction in a long list of hardship cases. In 1980 the deduction in hardship cases was greatly increased—to 20 per cent, of a single person's rate— and in 1983 the hardship list was itself drastically pruned. The cumulative effect has been greatly to increase the size of the deduction and to impose the full deduction in nearly every case, without regard to the hardship it may cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that would be bad and unfair if the deduction were to apply for at most six weeks, but we are talking about some £13 or so for six months for families with very low levels of income. That is a lot of money. The increase in the maximum period to six months makes it very different. For that reason, amendment No. 118 proposes that the deduction should be reduced to 20 per cent, in all cases. That is a deduction of £7 a week for 26 weeks, which would mean a loss of benefit amounting to £ 182. That £7 a week is still a considerable sum of money for people to lose. Deducting £7 from the very low rates of income support for which unemployed people qualify is a substantial penalty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At some stage, I shall try to work out the percentage. It will often be the man who is penalised in this way, but the woman will also be penalised, as she has to manage the household's budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right. We are always being assured that the family will not be punished as it is only the individual benefit that is being reduced, but that does not happen in the real world. In practice, families lump together all the benefits to which they are entitled, and that amount is distributed to cover everyone's needs. Taking away £13 will not mean that the man will go without £13 worth of things— the whole family will lose that £13.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put it another way, we are taking away two child benefits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, for six months. Because someone is said to have voluntarily made himself unemployed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the last time that I shall interrupt my hon. Friend on this point. It is unlawful for money lenders to get hold of child benefit books for one week, let alone six months. By effectively snatching two child benefit books for six months, the Government are acting in the same way for which we condemn money lenders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. It is a very serious matter when families are surviving on the minimum neccessary to live in a decent way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that he cannot accept the amendment, but I think that he can and hope that he will. It is a reasonable amendment, which leaves
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
the Minister with a severe penalty but will prevent gross improverishment. Perhaps the Minister thinks that losing £7 a week for six months is not enough of a penalty. However, he should consider the evidence. The system of deducting money from people after they have given up their job does not work as a deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1983, a report by the DHSS inspectorate on a survey of those who voluntarily left their jobs said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The deduction does not deter people from leaving their jobs voluntarily. Over three quarters of the claimants we saw did not know before they left their jobs that their supplementary benefit would be reduced and, had they known, most said the deductions would not have influenced their decision."</p></blockquote>
All those interviewed in the survey thought that they had a good reason for leaving their jobs and did not think that the deduction should have applied to them.
<br><br><!-- lb --> Reducing the deduction to 20 per cent, is unlikely to make any difference to the number of people leaving their jobs voluntarily. If the Minister cannot bring himself to accept that, amendment No. 121 offers an even more modest alternative. The Minister keeps telling us that he is listening. I am putting forward a very reasonable case, so it will test whether we really have a listening Government, at least in this case. In general, we know that that does not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 121 would simply restore the list of hardship categories to that which the Government wrote into the regulations in 1980. In addition to the existing categories of pregnancy and serious illness, it would include families with children under five, people whose last job was part time, temporary or low paid—that means families with no resources who have been surviving on very little money and cannot afford to have even less—people whose rent is not fully covered by housing benefit and other whose circumstances are analogous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 122 deals with a different matter. Regulation 22(2) of the Income Support (General) Regulations reduces the voluntary unemployment reduction from 40 per cent, to 20 per cent, where the claimant or a member of the family is pregnant or seriously ill. That concession applies only where the claimant's capital does not exceed £200.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A man came to my advice bureau who had separated from his wife. He had an entitlement to half the family home but had not taken it up because he thought that his ex-wife was entitled to live in the home that she had always lived in. As a result, he was not entitled to supplementary benefit because he had a notional entitlement to half of that house. It is an outrage that a man who behaves well towards his ex-wife is prevented from receiving supplementary benefit. That is shocking, although it is not in order to say that as it does not arise from the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The person with the problem was the ex-husband. The couple had separated and he had left the family home. He became unemployed and could not get benefit. I have written to him suggesting that he should see a solicitor and that there is probably a way of assigning those rights completely to his ex-wife, although I am told that there is a catch. If it was thought that he had done that deliberately to get benefit, it apparently would not work. That is just an example of a piece of cruelty—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that. I was trying to be kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return, as I am sure you would wish, Mr. Winterton, to amendment No. 122. We are talking
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
about cases where a claimant's benefit has been reduced because he has voluntarily made himself unemployed and he or a member of his family is seriously ill or, in the case of women, pregnant. Such people can get a reduction in the single person's benefit of 20 per cent, rather than 40 per cent. It goes down from approximately £13 a week to £7 a week. The concession applies only when the claimant's capital does not exceed £200. The amendment—I hope that the Minister will at least accept this— would increase the capital limit from £200 to £400. There are a number of reasons for wishing to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, £200 is a small amount of capital these days. The capital limit will be more important if amendment No. 121 is accepted, as many more people will then be within the scope of the 20 per cent, deduction. That is the optimistic scenario. Now that disqualification can run for 26 weeks, £200 is a small sum in relation to the total amount of the deduction. At the 40 per cent, rate if a person is disqualified from unemployment benefit for the maximum period of 26 weeks, the amount would be £362.70 in 1989–90 prices. Even at the 20 per cent, rate it would be £182.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For someone with £200 capital, making good the deductions will absorb almost all of his or her capital. Starting with £400 capital, as the amendment proposes, would still leave people with only £114 after 26 weeks under the present rules, even if they were well informed enough about their rights to tell the local DSS office when their capital fell below £200, so that their deductions could be adjusted. This is a small amendment and I am certain that the Minister will accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now come to amendment No. 123. Regulation 22(6) of the Income Support (General) Regulations provides that the 40 per cent, deduction is to continue for the whole period of disqualification for unemployment benefit—26 weeks in most cases. There is no limit on its duration when the deduction is imposed under paragraph (5) of the regulation, which applies when there is either a difference of medical opinion on incapacity and an appeal is pending or income support is being paid on hardship grounds to a claimant who is considered not to be available for work. Amendment No. 123 would impose an upper limit of six weeks on the deduction in all cases. I do not think that the Minister will accept that amendment, but I hope that he will accept all the others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So long as unemployment benefit disqualification was for at most six weeks, there was some justification for reducing income support, or, as it was then, supplementary benefit, for the same period. But there is no necessary link between the duration of unemployment benefit disqualification and the 40 per cent, reduction of income support. It is a much more serious matter to reduce income support for a lengthy period, especially to a family with young children, and especially when the deduction is as much as £13.95 a week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments deal with a small, but important, matter. We are discussing a penalty to be imposed on some of the poorest families—a deduction of £14 a week over six months. We suggest that if the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0354">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>599</span>
Government want to retain the penalty, it should be reduced and that the capital limit of £200 for those who are counted as suffering hardship should be raised to £400. I look forward to some serious concessions from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to help shape the Minister's response. Given my hon. Friend's powerful case, I hope that the Minister will not respond by relying on hearsay or mere prejudice, which may incite the hon. Member for Stockport (Mr. Favell) to jump up and offer his services. Will the Minister specifically answer my hon. Friend's argument by drawing on his inspectorate's report, which looks at what actually happens—not what people think happens—when people leave work? The report from the inspectorate found: first, that most people who had been penalised under the rules did not even know that the rules existed; secondly, that, even if they had known that the rules existed, they would have behaved as they had behaved; and, thirdly, that people thought that, even with the penalties, they were justified in leaving work. Given the reaction of the punters—the customers—in reality, how can the Minister possibly argue against the amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. So far we have had two excellent and concise speeches.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall endeavour to reflect that in my response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one shape or another and at one level or another the provision that people who render themselves voluntarily unemployed should suffer some penalty has been part of the social security system since 1948. The hon. Lady went over the history of the different levels and ways in which that penalty or deterrence has operated over the years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why does the Minister keep calling it a deterrent? For a deterrent to work, people have to understand that it is there and is effective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly believe that if we were to remove—	<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) has just intervened and he should do me the courtesy of listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were to remove the penalty altogether, it would be an encouragement for people to treat voluntary unemployment much too lightly and easily.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no amendment before the Committee that proposes removing it altogether.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I suggest to the Committee that we allow the Minister to respond to what I have described as two concise, excellent speeches. We can then see what argument there remains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister did not hear me. The amendments do propose not to remove the penalty altogether but to reduce it considerably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would retain the penalty, so presumably the hon. Lady thinks that it has some value, but would halve its amount. I shall advise the Committee not to accept that. I have said that we shall monitor carefully the impact of the 26 weeks' disqualification and in monitoring that we shall also perhaps be able to update the experience of the inspector and the previous judgments that were made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In essence, the Opposition are arguing that the 40 per cent, penalty is too harsh and that 20 per cent, would be better. They may accept the principle that there should be some penalty or deterrent. I hate to go back to the bad old days of Labour Governments, but the 40 per cent, penalty existed under the Labour Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When? Give us the date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I have misread. I believe that it was 40 per cent, under the Labour Government. That is my advice at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that the Opposition's argument is relevant. We say that a balance must be drawn. Of course it is a matter of judgment whether 20 per cent., 40 per cent, or any other figure is right. We have come to the conclusion that as long as we have the exemption for pregnancy and serious illness, 40 per cent, is an appropriate figure, bearing in mind that it is a deduction only from the personal allowance of the claimant and does not affect the benefit that is paid to dependents within the family. To reduce the figure from 40 per cent, to 20 per cent, would send out a signal to people that they may more lightly treat the question of voluntary unemployment. It would be saying that that is less unacceptable than it is when the 40 per cent, deduction applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 121 is lengthy. From 1971 until 1980, the 40 per cent, reduction applied—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From 1971. The Conservatives were in power then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From 1971. So from 1974 to 1979 it applied under a Labour Government. That is the point that I was making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand that that is the point that the Minister is making now, but I think that it is not precisely the point that he was making earlier. We accept, and my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short) said, that the 40 per cent, rate represented a tightening-up by the 1971 Conservative Government. Under pressure, with the co-operation of the Supplementary Benefit Commission, that was relaxed in a wide range of cases and it was only the return of a subsequent Conservative Government that tightened it again. It is true that the rate was not reduced under the Labour Government, but that was because the range of hardship cases was so wide, and I assume that the problem was not as serious then as it is now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we returned to office in 1983, a study was carried out into the extent to which the 20 per cent., rather than the 40 per cent., was applied. It was decided that it was appropriate to tighten the provisions and restrict the number of exemptions that allowed the 20 per cent. rate. Voluntary unemployment is not to be undertaken lightly, and a significant penalty should be attached to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 122 would alter one of the circumstances in which a claimant will suffer a 20 per cent, income support reduction on account of voluntary unemployment. I have already said that regulations provide for exemption of the pregnant or the seriously ill, and set the capital limit. The amendment would increase that capital limit from £200 to £400, but it was doubled in April 1988 from £100 to £200, and it would be premature to consider another doubling only one year on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 123 would restrict the period in which a sanction would be imposed to a maximum of six weeks for income support purposes, and the sanction would be different from that affecting unemployment benefit. It would destroy the link in such matters between unemployment benefit and income support, and I cannot commend it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We covered similar ground over the period of six weeks as against 26 weeks when we debated clause 9.1 reiterate that there should be a deterrent and that it should be significant. However, as I said on that occasion, we are monitoring the effects of the change to 26 weeks, and we shall make the results of that study available when it is completed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was disappointing. I outlined the history in some detail and the Minister cannot argue that it is the Labour party's fault or that it is a result of the Labour party's meanness. The settlement made in 1948 was a power to take 75p for six weeks. We had that in common, but then in 1971, the Tory Government put it up to 40 per cent. As a result of pressure from the Opposition, an undertaking was given to look into hardship cases, so the Tory Government were generous to hardship cases. It is true that the Labour Government did not repeal it during their short period in power, but back came the Tories and abolished the hardship cases. The story of meanness is a Tory story. It is a matter of record, and let us not play games with history. There is enough falsification of evidence in this great House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister asked us whether we accepted the principle. We accepted the principle of a short period with a small penalty, being generous in cases of hardship, but we do not accept the amount that is taken now and the period in which significant amounts of money are taken from very poor families. We totally reject the Government's argument that it is all right because it is taken only from the adult male and will not affect the children's standard of living because, as we all know, benefit is dealt with as a whole family income, and if there is a reduction in the family income, the children suffer just as much as the man.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
The Minister then said that if the Government accepted the amendments a signal would go out that people were allowed to be voluntarily unemployed. I have here the figures for the number of people who are disallowed: in the six months ending 30 June 1988, of those referred to an adjudicator, 86,000 were not upheld and did not lose their benefit, although the regional officers who referred them thought that they should, and 140,000 were disallowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence is that people do not know about the ruling. If the Government seriously wish to deter people I suggest that they get back to Saatchi and Saatchi and spend a few more millions of our money warning people on prime time television, "Don't give up your job voluntarily or we'll take 40 per cent, of your benefit." I suspect that Saatchi and Saatchi would advise the Government not to run the advertisement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a serious issue. The evidence is that most people do not know about the penalty when they decide to leave their jobs. If the Government want it to be more effective, they should advertise it. At present, people give up their jobs for reasons which, according to the Department, they consider valid and then they and their families are punished by the loss of £14 a week for six months, which is a considerable sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is being mean, and he was not listening. In this day and age, £200 capital is not a great sum when in the case of pregnancy or serious sickness in a family, it is the only provision for hardship. Pregnant women need better food, yet we are talking about reducing the family budget and possibily affecting the health of unborn children. In those circumstances, to deduct 20 per cent, for six months and to deny protection if a household has £200 is incredibly mean. The £400 could have been conceded readily and the Minister should be ashamed of himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was so concise that I may have missed one aspect. Will my hon. Friend tell me whether he covered serious illness? As the Government have moved to self-certification on sickness, will people be able to turn in their own notes here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the Minister covered this aspect, and I am sure that people will not be allowed to do so.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Beckett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend asked the Minister why, before he considers making any concession on the scope of hardship, the 20 per cent, or on the capital limit, he must first monitor the position. The Government did not need to do so before they doubled the penalty to 13 weeks and again to 26 weeks, so why do they need to monitor it now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because the Government's policy is about reducing people's expenditure and squeezing them harder. The Government need overwhelming proof of the need to be generous and no evidence whatever of the need to reduce people's incomes and damage their interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would give my hon. Friend anything I can, but that is not in my power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend amend her contribution in one respect? I know that she did not make this point because a Tory Member would have said that it was a typical feminist line. My hon. Friend said that men and children would be equally affected by the provision. She was right, but the real loser in most working class homes will be the mother. She is the last person to eat when there is not enough food to go round and the last person to buy things for herself from the family budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an extraordinary provision. The people whom it will affect do not realise that they will be penalised. Moreover, this arbitrary power will be applied not against the person who has left a job with or without good cause but against someone else the family—the person who has to manage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is absolutely right. My granny died at a great age only a few years ago. Throughout her life she ate after other people had finished because times had been hard in the past. Often she did not have any meat, but she made sure that others did.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the Minister would not concede even a limit of £400. He said that he would monitor the effects, but what sort of monitoring does he have in mind? He owes his Department a study of how far the provision will act as a deterrent. It is pure meanness, because it will lead to the impoverishment of children who do not live well rather than to deterrence. The Government owe it to themselves to ask questions first and then produce the evidence. If nothing else, will the Minister give me an undertaking that whether or not the provision deters, it will be a specific aspect of the study?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that we are not terribly interested in the Minister's survey of whether the provision will be a deterrent, may we appeal to him to ensure that monitoring—we have had this sort of survey in the past and the Government pay no attention to the results—will not be on the effects of the rule on men only but will extend to the family to show who is penalised most by the rule? All of us would be interested in that result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the hon. Member for Lady wood was interested in results of the survey and was pressing me to see to it that it covered those points. I think that it will. The inspectorate's report to which the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) alluded was produced in 1983. Since then, the period has been changed to 26 weeks so the position is not the same. The deterrent effect might be greater now that the period has been extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked about the capital point because I was uncertain about it, as other hon. Members may be. If a person had capital in excess of £200, and he used it for ordinary expenses, which would bring it below
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
£200, it would be open to him to come back for a judgment to be made about whether he qualified for the 20 per cent. rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendments. I have explained to the hon. Lady the reason for this. I also explained that we shall survey this matter and I will look at whether the points that have been mentioned will come out as a result.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister realises that we are getting down to the nitty-gritty of the Bill, which is about collecting money. The amendments relate to cases in which income support is deducted by 40 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 124 is very important. Let us take the example of a sick or disabled person who gets a sick line from his doctor every week or perhaps once a month. Someone who thinks that he is not as ill as he claims to be complains about him. The DSS doctor gives him an examination, disagrees with the claimant's doctor and declares the man fit for light work. Under the clause his money should be discontinued, but because of his hardship, the adjudication officer decides to deduct 40 per cent. The man decides to appeal and that is dangerous: he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0357">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
must wait until the appeal and in the meantime loses 40 per cent. We want that deduction deferred until after the final appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was raised last year in the other place by Lord Henderson of Brompton. Lord Skelmersdale explained that it was nothing new; it was in the supplementary benefit regulations, but we were worried about it. The Department of Social Security manual stated that an adjudication officer should rule in favour of the claimant in such cases. There is no such reference in the new guidelines, which means that a claimant whose case went to appeal would lose what he gets now—his money minus the 40 per cent, deductions. The amendment would abolish that clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 125 relates to disqualification for not actively seeking employment. Does the Minister realise that in 1987–88, more than half a million claimants were disqualified? That is an absolute disgrace. I wonder if Ministers are living in the same world as I am. There are human beings outside who are living in the most appalling conditions. They cry like we cry. They like to be happy, as we like to be happy. They like to live in luxury as we like to live in luxury. They are not asking for a lot. How can the Government implement these clauses? How can Conservative Members agree with them? Is there any compassin in the Minister's heart. I thought earlier that there was a glimmer of light, but I am not as optimistic as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Ms Short). She thought that he might give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing wrong with the amendments. The hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) is smiling, but this is a serious matter. I know of a street of 320 people where only 20 have a job. Those people are living in poverty and I am worried about their health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would alleviate the poverty created by the Bill. Amendments Nos. 125 and 126 are linked. As my hon. Friend the Member for Ladywood said, amendment No. 125 would prevent the 40 per cent, deduction. Amendment No. 126 emphasises the compassionate angle. We want only 20 per cent, to be deducted, which might help some.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is an absolute disgrace; it is a Bill of harassment. It will gather the coppers for the Prime Minister's vault.

They all once had jobs, homes and self-respect but, through a series of tragedies and misfortunes, they are reduced to begging on the street. The hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 127 relates to hardship. On 30 December 1981,1 was in difficult circumstances and had three children. At the time I was a regional councillor, I was on holiday, as it was the Christmas period, and did not have to start work until 5 January. My only job was that of a regional councillor; it was difficult to get work if people knew that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had £1 in my pocket and walked for 10 miles to the DHSS office. I had locked the door to my home and told the children not to let anyone in until I returned. At the DHSS, I was interviewed by a wee girl who asked why I had no money. I told her that I earned only £69 a week as a regional councillor. She said that I should have saved for Christmas and my money would have lasted until 5 January. I walked out because I was embarrassed and my pride was hurt. I went to a phone box to telephone a Member of Parliament, who then telephoned the manager. The manager told him to send me back to the DHSS office, so I went back. He said that he could not give me anything just then, except an emergency payment of £43. But he also gave me a slip, which he sent out in the post. It said that I had to repay that money once I started back to work. I had not drawn anything for many years. I had £1, three children and not a bite to eat. It was 30 December 1981. I walked through the snow from Eglinton Toll in the Gorbals to Mearnskirk, 10 miles away. Before I went up the road, I bought three apple turnovers, a pint of milk and a loaf of bread, so I had to walk as I had no more money. I did not want to turn to anyone else, although there were probably a thousand people whom I could have telephoned. I could have got £10 from the then hon. Member for Glasgow, Pollok if I had telephoned him, but my pride would not allow me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We move the amendments with compassion because we understand how difficult life can be. It was 30 December. I closed the door and waited for the £43 to come on 31 December, which was hogmanay. When it came I bought £43 worth of messages and locked myself in with my three kids until 5 January when I could get a sub from the regional council because I had worked for a day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Conservative Members are to be pitied because few of them can have shared that experience. I was told that the Minister was a compassionate man. I wonder how compassionate he will be today when we have tabled begging bowl amendments and given him every opportunity, going from 40 to 20 per cent, and asking him to consider at least some concession. I hope that he examines our proposals to try to alleviate some of the hardship that the Government are causing people in my constituency, in Scotland and all over Britain. The amendments will not cost much.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Michie</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Glagow, Provan (Mr. Wray) for his vivid description of what happens in the real world. Most of our amendments have tried to protect as much as
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
possible the most vulnerable in our society, which has been our aim on all social security legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that almost every week Opposition Members hear of problems with delayed payments or with judgments after appeal and their effect on people. Some people have no family or friends around them and cannot borrow money. They are literally stuck. My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) is right. People are driven to acts such as begging which a few years ago they would never have dreamt of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the message is registered. Tomorrow I will be back in my constituency. I hope that I will not hear a bad case, but the odds are that I will get at least one where the present DSS regulations are unfairly affecting someone who is innocent of any crime but who, because of the system, the restrictions and the misunderstandings will be without money this weekend and perhaps next week until the case can be resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I left my constituency on Monday, I saw a young pregnant girl who had no money at all and had to have an emergency distress loan on the understanding, of course, that she pays it back as soon as she gets any money through the post. She is three or four weeks from having her baby and lives in a flat with no furniture, which is a problem we are trying to deal with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
She is not an isloated case. We see such people every Monday, Friday and Saturday in our constituencies. We are not trying to exert political pressure or seeking to make kudos. We are pleading from the bottom of our hearts. The problem is bad enough without these new regulations and restrictions making matters worse for all concerned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is common ground across the Floor of the Committee that there should be clear conditions attached to entitlement to income support. I certainly believe in the importance of that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
National assistance, which became supplementary benefit and is now income support, is a benefit of last resort. It is important that it includes provisions to ensure that people who fail to satisfy basic conditions of entitlement are not left destitute. This group of amendments bears on the safety-net type of provision that comes under that heading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under amendment No. 124, someone pursuing an appeal about whether he was fit for work would receive the full rate of income support, not the reduced rate. That would put him on a par with someone who satisfied all the conditions for benefit. The type of case in question is one where there is a conflict of medical opinion, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) pointed out, and the adjudication officer has decided, after weighing up all the available evidence, that the claimant is not incapable of work. There will be opinions from two Department of Health doctors that the claimant is fit for work, but the claimant's doctor will continue to issue medical certificates, and the claimant will take the view that he is unable to make himself available for work on that basis. He appeals against the adjudication officer's decision. Because of the conflict of medical opinion, and despite the fact there
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0359">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>609</span>
is no title to benefit under normal conditions, the claimant is paid income support automatically until his appeal is heard or his circumstances change, but his benefit is set at the safety-net rate, since it would not be right to pay full benefit to someone who is adjudged not to satisfy the usual conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similar arguments apply to amendment No. 125. The person has not satisfied the availability condition—or, in future, the actively seeking work condition—and a hardship payment is paid at the reduced rate. Once again, it would defeat the object of having clear rules for benefits if those who do not satisfy the conditions receive the same amount of money as those who do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor can I advise the Committee to accept amendment No. 127, which would limit the period of such payments to 21 days, because that would render any reduction totally useless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to accept amendment No. 126, it would mean that a claimant who had not met the availability or actively seeking work condition, and who had satisfied the adjudication officer that he or a member of his family would suffer hardship if benefit was not paid, would receive benefit at a rate reduced by only 20 per cent., rather than the standard 40 per cent. We have already discussed the rationale behind the 40 per cent, deduction in our debate on amendment No. 118, and I shall not weary the Committee by going over it again. Therefore, I ask the Committee to reject that amendment, along with the others in the group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

An old woman came to my surgery one Saturday morning and said, "I am finding it very difficult to survive because of the hard winter. I wonder if you could give me some advice, Jimmy?" That is how we talk to one another in our constituency—on a one-to-one basis. I said to her, "Wha kind of advice?" She said, "Well, I'm having difficulty with my electricity bill, and someone said that there is a possibility that you could stop the wheel going round. When you turn the meter on, it whirls round like a merry-go-round, and the quicker it goes round the faster it eats up the money."

When I wander round my constituency in winter, I see paraffin heaters and one-bar fires, but only one

part of the house is warm—not too warm. People cannot afford more. That is why local authorities in Scotland set up fuel poverty committees. That is how the Governemnt were pressured into making cold weather payments. The high streets are full of Oxfam shops and sale rooms because people do not have enough money to make ends meet or clothe themselves properly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no desire to detract from the theme that my hon. Friend is developing, but when he talked about the meter going round and eating up money, it reminded me of a family in Salford who had no money at all one Christmas day. However, what they did have was a medal of St. Boniface. So they filed off the hook that linked the medal to the chain, and throughout Christmas they passed St. Boniface through the meter. They said that it was St. Boniface's miracle, because they had heat and light over Christmas, as with all man-made miracles, the day of reckoning came when the meter man arrived. He saw it in a different light.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The day of reckoning has indeed come, and it is not Boniface, it is grim face. I cannot accept that this is wholly appropriate. The hon. Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray) was developing an extremely good case, but I hope that he will not be diverted by rather extraneous matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult enough when the Chairman is grim-faced, but just imagine what it would be like if he were wearing an electricity board uniform.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his response to amendment No. 125, the Minister talked about availability or actively seeking work, but he made no mention of the 500,000 people who were disqualified. Does he think that they all deserve to be disqualified? The adjudication officers are called the gestapo in my constituency because of the way they subject people to questionnaires. It is quite deplorable. I spend many hours in many houses discussing people's problems, and there will be many more cases like that of Rachel Cain, because there is no way out once the adjudication officer deducts all the money. Adjudication officers seem to have no compassion. I would like to spend a couple of days with some of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The adjudication officer is important in one respect. The focus of the legislation is directed away from the nature of the alternative work opportunity offered, and towards the individual person. Adjudication officers are expected to make personal and subjective judgments about the people who come before them. We shall be in the age of adjudication officers offering value judgments as to whether families spend their money on "fish and chips" when they should spend it more wisely, or expecting families to have freezers and to bulk buy. Although that is a cheaper way of buying food for other people, those who have no freezers do not have that opportunity for making their incomes go further. Surely it is wrong for the Bill to put adjudicators in that invidious position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very concerned about the overworked adjudication officers. Obviously if they are overworked they are tired and may not make the right decision. But they have an important job and, as I said, I should like to spend a couple of days with them and give them some guidelines. In many cases, they seem to be disqualifying claimants for the maximum period of 26 weeks. That causes us great concern.

Since this began, citizens advice bureaux throughout the country have been overworked because of people seeking advice. The pressure on Scottish Members because of the hardship and poverty has been considerable. CAB advisory officers have come to our surgeries and telephoned us at the House of Commons saying, "We are overworked. Our work load has increased by 32 per cent, since the measures were announced. What can we do?" As chairman of health and social services for the Scottish parliamentary group, there was only one thing I could do. I have organised a conference on poverty and have invited every CAB officer, junior and senior, in Scotland. The conference will be addressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), our shadow spokesman on health matters. Our local Member of the European Parliament will be present. Sir Charles O'Halloran will also address the conference. The chairman of the CAB in Glasgow will be there. There are 60 citizens advice bureaux in Scotland. This means that 120 people will attend. I have also invited the convener of Strathclyde region social work department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Frank Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend completes his list of those who will attend the conference—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that he will not do so. I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman but I am finding it difficult to see how this relates to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The list is relevant, Mr. Winterton, because all those people have something in common—they all deal with hardship and poverty. We in Scotland are very worried. I am hoping that the Government will have a change of heart.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Field</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to encourage my hon. Friend to extend the list of people who will attend the conference because of the Chairman's ruling. An additional way of making the list even more relevant to the debates would be to invite the Minister to the conference to explain how beneficial the Bill will be for my hon. Friend's constituents. If he does that successfully, perhaps we shall ask him to attend our meetings around the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what will happen. Because of hardship, and because of the 40 per cent, reduction in income support that will be applied if a person is disqualified, the city is being turned into a Bombay. I repeat it because it is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Favell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that there had been a renaissance in Glasgow. The hon. Gentleman is
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
painting a picture of Bombay, but is Glasgow really like that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Nicholson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Taunton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Miles better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was miles better until we had a new Government. Since then it has slowly deteriorated. The Tories have dismantled all the services that we provided and built over the years. Many hours and lots of money were spent providing them. The Government are on their last legs which is why, unfortunately, they are looking for money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Short</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bombay is a city of extremes. There are many rich people there. It is the centre of the Indian film industry. There is also terrible poverty. My understanding is that the situation in Glasgow is similar to that in other cities—increasingly divided, with some people doing very well and others doing very badly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That seems to be the great divide: there are the rich, the poor and the very poor.

What bothers me is the distress that many women will suffer because of the starvation policies inflicted upon them by Bills such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raises his eyebrows. It reminds me of the time that we had a debate on the Floor of the House on poverty in London. I recall my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson) presenting information on homelessness and poverty in his constituency. I am sure that my hon. Friend remembers the Minister who is here in Committee replying to that debate and saying, "This is a London that I cannot recognise", to which we replied, "Exactly." He replied in turn, "That is because it does not exist." I get the impression that Tory Members do not believe that there is poverty left in Britain. They think that they have only a few people to mop up and that the Bill will catch them. That is the attitude that they adopt instead of trying to appreciate the structural division in our cities that we live with daily as Members of Parliament and public representatives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You have hit the nail on the head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have hit nothing on the head. However, I am tempted to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise again, Mr. Winterton.

Where are the jobs? There is a tendency to think that it is criminal, or dishonest, to be unemployed. People must prove that they are actively seeking work, or are available for work. What happens if a housewife has a part-time job and asks her husband to look after the children while she is out looking for an extra few coppers? Is he available for work? No, he is not. He would be disqualified. People are not being allowed to try to get out of the poverty trap. All the systems that have been set up are creating more hardship and catching people in the poverty trap because of the calculations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spoke earlier in the week about the Coventry calculations, which were phoney figures. They are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0361">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
there in black and white. I ordered the two Government leaflets. The woman who runs the Child Poverty Action Group said that she will obtain them for me. I will give them to the Minister so that he will realise that his departments are not doing their job. Not only do they give out false information, they put people in the worst possible position, in which they accept the carrot and, when they have earned a wee bit more than they should, their benefits disappear. They are then £2 or £3 worse off than at the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to unemployment figures and vacancies, people are saying that jobs are available, but the figures for the number of vacancies are being distorted. The Department which initiated the inquiry for the Government said that jobcentres handled 35 per cent, of available jobs. I want to know how that compares with the 150,000 vacancies that were announced in the past year. If jobcentres handle 35 per cent, of jobs, by my calculations that is about 78,000 vacancies. Such figures do not help the unemployed. The jobs are not there and vacancies that exist are at sweat shop rates. I do not want people, no matter who they are—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Corbyn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point about the number of vacancies that are registered with jobcentres. One problem of registered vacancies is that the majority are filled by people who are already in work. There is a transition between one job and another through the jobcentre register of vacancies, whereas the majority of the unemployed have difficulty obtaining work. Therefore, figures relating to the unemployed are often meaningless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the hon. Member replies, I suggest that rather than describing in the macro sense the problems as he sees them today, he relates his remarks to how the amendments can improve the current situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn) is correct about how the job vacancies are filled. Of the 700,000 vacancies filled last year, 98 per cent, were through job changes; that left only 2 per cent. Those are Government figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government introduce a Bill which forces people to take jobs, they must ensure that the jobs exist. Moreover, if the aim is to eradicate hardship and poverty, the Government must introduce a minimum wage. If it is intimated that the average wage is £245 a week, it is not a lot to ask for a minimum wage of £150. We are talking about poverty and hardship. Every Opposition Member would be happy if the Minister came into Committee next Tuesday morning and announced lots of jobs at that rate of pay. We should gladly be out with banners asking people to take them. We are not being hypocritical. People do not want to live their lives when there is no light at the end of the tunnel. They are decent people who are unemployed and humble. I meet them every Saturday. I walk among them. I am of them, with them, and for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If only Conservative Members would listen. We try hour after hour in the Chamber to convince them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
We spend many hours in the Tea Room talking to members of other parties to find a solution to eradicate poverty and hardship throughout the country. It is not only a matter of poverty and hardship, but of crime against the person. Sometimes, when there is no way out, people do certain things to survive. The Government are creating such circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
You have been most attentive, Mr. Winterton, and I only hope that I am getting through to you and to your Government—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. When in the Chair I am totally impartial and I do not represent the Government in any way. Nor do I represent the Opposition. I seek to ensure impartial, fair play in the debates in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Wray</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that, Mr. Winterton, and apologise for my remarks. As a new Member, I am still finding my way. Not often do we have the opportunity to preach the gospel to Conservative Members about such important matters as hardship, poverty and unemployment. Today, the Minister has been disappointing as regards decisions. The Opposition gave him every opportunity—we offered him a loophole. But clearly the Minister does not make the decisions; they are made somewhere else. That is most unfortunate. On that note, I commend the amendment to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Flynn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was not commensurate with the savagery of the present law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, two doctors may disagree, as happens with insurance claims. The one acting for the DSS may go one way, but the doctor acting for the patient, knowing his or her long medical history, is likely to hold the correct opinion. The result of that disagreement may be that the claimant is told to sign on as unemployed and make himself available for work if he wishes to continue drawing benefit. If he disagrees with the DSS doctor's opinion, he can appeal. The appeal tribunal would then decide which doctor is right. If the claimant appeals, he is allowed to continue drawing income support, without making himself available for work, until the tribunal has made a decision. But during that time his income support is reduced by 40 per cent., or £13.95. That is an enormous loss. His disposable income is probably only a few pounds a week. Such a loss will disrupt his income and budget for weeks and even months; indeed, it may take him months to recover. Let us recall what happened during the steel strike. The community took five or six years to recover from the three-month strike.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would, in a reasonable way, end the harshness of the present system. People are judged, because of a disagreement in medical opinions, to be guilty, so thay suffer hardship without any immediate recourse. Even in tribunal decisions, there is often a great hiatus before the action is taken. In many cases, there is a disgraceful delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will respond to my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray),
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1988-1989V006P0I0362">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
who drew attention to the fact that before 1988 the guidance issued to adjudication officers in the S manual was that, usually, when it is one doctor's opinion against that of another, to give a decision favourable to the claimant while the matter is being resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That advice did not appear in the adjudication officer's guide which has now replaced the manual. Why not? That would seem to be the reasonable and fair approach. There will probably be far more such cases when the 40 per cent, deduction is applied to someone whose own doctor says that he is sick and unfit for work. Can the Minister give an undertaking that such advice will be replaced in the adjudication officer's manual?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Scott</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In essence, the case would be considered by a Department of Health doctor. If there was a difference of opinion between that Health Service doctor and the claimant's general practitioner, the case would be referred to another Health Service doctor for a second opinion. Only if those two doctors disagreed with the GP would the benefit be withdrawn or reduced to the safety net level— 	<i>[Interruption.]</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
