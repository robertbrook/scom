	<div class='legislation'>Draft Child Support (Compensation for Recipients of Family Credit and Disability Working Allowance) Regulations 1995</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Mr. Andrew Mitchell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Child Support (Compensation for Recipients of Family Credit and Disability Working Allowance) Regulations 1995.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Child Support (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Regulations 1995.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: These packages of regulations serve primarily to give effect to provisions in the Child Support Act 1995 which received Royal Assent in July. Hon. Members will recall that the Act provided for a number of improvements to child support. Provisions relating to the departures system and the child maintenance bonus will be brought forward in due course. The regulations before the Committee provide for more detailed, and largely technical, improvements in four areas: simplification and enhancements to the review process; improvements to the provisions for the payment of maintenance; removal or suspension of reduced benefit directions in specific circumstances; and compensation for reductions in maintenance resulting from changes in child support legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opportunity has been taken to address other difficulties with existing child support regulations particularly in provisions for handling information, interim maintenance assessments, the effective dates of maintenance assessments and detailed formula rules on the treatment of housing and travel-to-work costs. I hope that the Committee will find it convenient if I touch briefly on all four areas of improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review process is one way in which the child support scheme improves on earlier court-based methods of assessing child maintenance. Under child support legislation, a maintenance assessment can be varied readily by a process known as review if circumstances change or the assessment is found to be wrong. In contrast, there was no ready means by which a court order could be reviewed and the court process for varying such an order was costly and often time consuming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The child support review process has, however, turned out to be more difficult than had been hoped. As hon. Members know, significant review work backlogs have built up. The regulations address two key sources of inefficiency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the first place, in a review based on a change of circumstances, the legislation required a child support officer to look again at every aspect of the assessment, resulting in wasted effort as many details were difficult to
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
confirm. This often meant that parents were asked repeatedly to confirm basic information. To improve that, the 1995 Act provides that when conducting a review in relation to a change of circumstances, the child support officer will need to look only at reported changes rather than re-examining the whole assessment. The regulations provide further detailed provisions governing the new review process. In particular, regulations 24 and 25 provide for the effect of the new review process on the cycle of periodic reviews and regulations 26 to 31 make consequential amendments to the tolerance rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second difficulty derives from the failure of parents to provide the information necessary to complete a review. The 1995 Act provides sanctions for parents failing to comply with requests for information in those circumstances. Absent parents face the imposition of an interim maintenance assessment while the parent with care may have her assessment cancelled if she is not on benefit. That will help to ensure fairness between the absent parent and the parent with care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 7 to 10 and 35 provide that parents will be warned of the consequences of failing to provide that information, and for a number of consequential technical changes to the general requirement to furnish information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area of improvement is in payment of maintenance. The 1995 Act introduced improvements to provisions for payment of maintenance. In particular, section 23 changed the rules for repaying overpaid maintenance to the absent parent. The regulations contain provisions that supplement those in the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 2 makes it clear that arrears of child maintenance for a period before the maintenance assessment was made can be retained to offset income-related benefit paid because maintenance was not paid on time. Regulation 3 provides for circumstances in which a parent with care will not be required to repay an overpayment of maintenance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the third area, reduced benefit directions. Hon. Members may recall that during debates on the Child Support Bill, concern was expressed both in the House and in another place about the effect of reduced benefit directions on parents with care who chose not to co-operate with the Child Support Agency. We agreed to exempt those who were disabled or caring for a disabled person from facing a reduced benefit direction. Regulation 37 provides that exemption. We also agreed that those who were repaying debts by deduction from their income support would have the reduced benefit direction suspended. Regulation 38 gives effect to that concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth area is concerned with compensation for recipients of family credit and disability working allowance. In section 24 of the Child Support Act 1995, the Government provided for regulations to be made to enable payment of compensation to people receiving family credit or disability working allowance who would otherwise lose money directly as a result of specified child support legislation changes which reduced their maintenance. Compensation was to be at the rate of 50 per cent. of the reduction of maintenance assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Child Support (Compensation for Recipients of Family Credit and Disability Working Allowance) Regulations 1995 provide for compensation to be made for reductions in maintenance arising from the April 1995 package of regulation changes. In anticipation of the provision, payments have been made on an ex gratia basis.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Almost 5,000 payments have been made; the regulations put the payments on a proper statutory footing and provide for any further payments required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two packages of regulations contain important improvements to the provision for child support and enhancements to the protection for those receiving maintenance. They reflect the Government's continuing determination and commitment to seeking and making sensible improvements to the child support scheme while retaining the fundamental principle of child support. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.37 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Wicks 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Croydon, North-West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: At first sight, as is often the case on such occasions, the regulations appear daunting. They are an illustration of the fact that much contemporary social security legislation depends for its detailed implementation on regulation and that child support in the United Kingdom is a complex matter. It is much more complex than the somewhat older child support scheme in Australia, for example, which has a relatively broad-brush approach and would seem to be easier to implement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have sought to introduce—and have struggled to make effective—a more detailed and, therefore, more intricate system of assessment, arguably in an attempt to reflect the increasingly changeable and confusing picture of family life in the 1990s. The regulations—[

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wicks</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mrs. Dunwoody. I thought that on the occasion of my first speech from the Front Bench, the bell was tolling for me. I am pleased that that appears not to be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are an attempt to reflect the intricacies of the situation. They flow, as the Minister implied, from what could be called the rescue package of measures heralded in the White Paper, "Improving Child Support", published in January this year, which led to the Child Support Act 1995. The Opposition gave broad support to that measure while arguing for improvements, not least of which was a child support disregard for those parents with care—usually mothers—who are dependent on income support and represent at any one time about 70 per cent. of one-parent families on income support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, I should like to ask the Minister for clarification on one specific aspect of the regulations: compensation for recipients of family credit and disability working allowance, a subject that the Minister has already touched on. That is important because, broadly speaking, the rescue package favours those who are referred to as "absent parents". I should say in passing that we all believe that that term is not appropriate. Many so-called absent parents who seek to maintian a full relationship with their children resent the terminology. I know that the Government are seeking more appropriate language, and we urge them to achieve some consensus on the matter. However, I shall use the term for the sake of technical argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rescue package broadly favoured the absent parent, although not exclusively. If, as a result of these measures, some absent parents will pay less child support, it follows that mothers, or parents with care, will receive less child support. That is particularly important for those on family
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
credit who, unlike those on income support, are not subject to the pound-for-pound reduction of child support against their benefit, but who rather—quite rightly—share in some of the proceeds. They receive the first £15 of child support without their family credit being affected and thereafter 30 per cent. of the remainder. The Opposition support that approach because it is an important element in the building of a package of income, which is crucial if we are to construct a viable and successful welfare-to-work strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations provide compensation, but they are calculated as one half of the reduction in maintenance for a specified period. That matter was discussed on 25 April this year during the Committee stage of the Child Support Act 1995, a Committee on which both the Minister and I served in a different capacity. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Bradley) asked the then Minister, the hon. Member for Bury, North (Mr. Burt), why only half the amount was being provided for in compensation. The Minister gave two reasons, which we understood. The first was that, on application for family credit, parents with care—usually mothers—were often not receiving the full maintenance to which they were entitled, but a lesser amount. Consequently, given the workings of the family credit scheme, they received more family credit than they would have received if the full child support was being paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason was that a disregard was in operation for child support so that the reduction in income never resulted in a family credit increase of more than 70 per cent. of that reduction. We understand that, but would like the Minister to address that point again. The Committee needs to be satisfied that this is a fair formula for compensation, although it is understood that the nature of family credit entails an element of rough justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has already given us some data on that matter, but will he tell us how many parents with care are affected at present and how many are likely to be affected in the coming months? Secondly, as the new arrangements have already been in operation since April, does the evidence so far suggest that the formula is fair to the parent with care, usually the mother?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.43 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Mitchell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first welcome the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Wicks) to his position on the Labour Front Bench. As he said, he and I both served on the Committee considering the 1995 Act earlier this year; he was harrying the then Minister from the Back Benches and I was occupying the position of Whip now graced by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon, South (Mr. Ottaway).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's point about the complexity of the system is well understood on both sides of the House. It is an immensely complex formula, but it is designed to ensure that everyone has a bespoke arrangement that takes the features of their own case into account. We civilised the process earlier this year by introducing the 30 per cent. absolute cap on the payment of current maintenance, which it had always been the intention to do. That 30 per cent. limit and the departure system which will be introduced as soon as possible demonstrate to absent parents that we are keen to ensure that the necessary ingredients of fairness are incorporated. The result has been a sharp diminution in the number of complaints from absent parents received by right hon. and hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1995-1996V008P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
The hon. Gentleman asked me about the family credit arrangements. He mentioned a point that his hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Miss Hoey) made in the Select Committee on Social Security last week, namely that the term "absent parent" can cause offence in certain circumstances. We are all at one in wishing to aviod that. As I said to the Select Committee, let us see whether together we can find a term that meets the requirements but does not cause offence to those who could be offended by the term "absent parent".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then mentioned that the rescue package by and large favoured absent parents. He is right about that. As I said, the 30 per cent. limit, the departure system, which I hope will be piloted next April, and the broad-brush changes to travel-to-work and to capital and property settlements, which were introduced in April, have underlined the fact that the system is now fair to absent parents in principle. We must, however, ensure that the administration, which leaves a lot to be desired, continues to make the necessary improvements, as it has done over recent months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about the disregard. Obviously, I heard what he said during the Committee stage of the 1995 Act. I recognise the difference of view between the two sides of the Committee on that point. We believe that the child maintenance bonus, which will be brought in as soon as is practical, helps to address the problem, but I accept that it does not meet the points that the hon. Gentleman made in Committee. Nevetheless, we believe that, overall, what we have set up is more satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then asked specifically about the compensation package. Perhaps I should remind the Committee that the compensation scheme was proposed because awards for family credit and disability working allowance cannot be revised to take account of a reduction in maintenance. They are broad-brush schemes which run for six months. If they could be reassessed, however, the additional amount of benefit payable would depend on the amount of maintenance taken into account in their existing award. It would, however, always be somewhat less than the reduction in the maintenance assessment for two reasons which the hon. Gentleman touched on and which were raised in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
First, the family credit assessment is based on the actual amount of maintenance that the absent parent is paying at the time of the claim, which is often less than the full maintenance assessment. Secondly, the first £15 a week of maintenance received and 30 per cent. of the balance is disregarded in the family credit assessment disregard. Therefore a reduction in income can never result in an increase of benefit of more than 70 per cent. of that reduction. The amount of compensation is intended to provide a broad measure of support to those parents with care whose maintenance assessment is reduced. Compensation tailored to the the actual loss of benefit would require a long and costly exercise which would inevitably lead to delays in the payments being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can tell the Committee that not one complaint has been received about the level of compensation. To date, almost 5,000 families have been paid compensation on an extra statutory basis at an average of £58 per award. The cost to date is in the region of £300,000 although there are a few cases in which entitlement to compensation has still to be assessed. Officials tell me that the figure is around 400. I hope that that answers the questions that the hon. Gentleman has raised on the two important sets of regulations. I hope that they will commend themselves to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
