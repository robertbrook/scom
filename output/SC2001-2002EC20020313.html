	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (Miss Melanie Johnson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Benton. I am grateful for the opportunity to explain the current state of play on the cosmetics directive. The European Commission's proposed seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive is regarded by the Government as an important and valuable contribution towards improving animal welfare and increasing the safety of cosmetic products. Before I go into the details of the proposal, I wish to emphasise a few matters that are extremely pertinent to our discussion this morning. Members of the Committee will have received the common position text that was adopted on 14 February. It is substantially the same as the text that was submitted with my Department's explanatory memorandum on 14 November last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The products covered by the cosmetics directive are much more than traditional cosmetics. Cosmetics may seem frivolous items, but the directive covers all personal hygiene items such as toothpastes, shaving creams, sunscreens and baby care products; items that we all use every day. Their testing must ensure that such products are safe for children and adults to use. That is crucial, so we must be sure that non-animal tests exist that are as scientifically reliable as the current tests on animals if we are to allow the continuing development of new ingredients. It should be noted that animal testing on cosmetics and their ingredients accounts for only 0.3 per cent. of the total number of animals, primarily rats and mice, used in experiments in the European Union.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United Kingdom chose not to test finished cosmetic products or their ingredients on animals, and has not done so since 1998. Therefore, the impact of parts of the amendment on the United Kingdom industry will be limited. That was recognised by the House of Commons Select Committee on European Scrutiny, which stated in the conclusion to its seventh report:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The direct consequences of the changes proposed by the Presidency for Cosmetics produced within the UK would be limited and that its main impact would be on those imported from third countries."</p></blockquote>
However, we need to go further and do what we legitimately can to drive down the testing of cosmetics on animals world wide. That is why we support the cosmetics directive seventh amendment common position text that was adopted on 14 February. The text is worthy of the House's support both to protect consumers and to promote animal welfare issues. I shall now highlight some of the reasons why that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
First, several measures proposed within the seventh amendment test will directly enhance consumer protection and safety. There is a requirement that substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens and substances toxic to reproduction—CMRs—used in cosmetic products shall be subject to an immediate risk evaluation by the European Commission. Following that evaluation, and after consultation with the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic and Non-Food Products, the Commission can take any measures that are deemed necessary. That will be the first time that CMRs have been subjected to an immediate evaluation by the Commission, which is a welcome move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The text includes a provision that will require all cosmetic products to bear a date of minimum durability or best before date. That is the date until which the cosmetic product stored under the appropriate conditions continues to fulfil its intended function. The seventh amendment also requires any cosmetic products intended for children under the age of three or for external intimate hygiene to be subjected to a specific safety assessment before they are placed on the market. That is a positive and extremely sensible provision, the first part of which will help to protect small children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, in terms of animal welfare, the text offers a complete ban on animal tests of finished cosmetic products. The ban is unconditional and would, if agreed, represent a significant step forward for most European Union member states. Currently, the majority of countries in the EU still allow the testing of finished products. The only countries to have adopted a similar line to the United Kingdom and banned animal testing for cosmetics are the Netherlands, Austria and Germany.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in respect of testing cosmetic ingredients are more complex; not in outcome, as the end result would be a ban on testing ingredients, but in terms of timing. I shall discuss them shortly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The testing ban is controversial, as today's debate shows. Animal welfare groups have made it clear that the text may not go far enough, and they will be satisfied only with an outright and immediate ban on testing in the EU on both finished products and ingredients. They also want what was proposed in the unimplemented sixth amendment; an outright and immediate ban on the marketing in the EU of products tested on animals, which would affect all cosmetic imports as well as EU-produced cosmetics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the proposals, non-animal testing will replace animal testing, immediately for new products and over time for newly developed ingredients. They will apply to ingredients developed in the EU and anywhere else in the world and will prohibit the supply to the EU of products that have been tested on animals, no matter where in the world the tests have been carried out. Therefore, EU internal policy would have an external effect, too. In effect, we shall reach the same end point as the sixth amendment, but in a way that ensures the continuing development of new ingredients to the same health and safety standards as now. We believe that that will be compatible with our international obligations, and it is more likely to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0436">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
support our longer-term aim of persuading other nations to adopt higher animal welfare standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise strongly with those pressing for a worldwide ban on the testing of cosmetics on animals, which is our ultimate goal, too. However, we believe that the first and most important step is to ban outright the testing of finished cosmetic products on animals in the EU. We must first put our own house in order in the EU if we are to carry the rest of the world with us on this important ethical issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we strongly agree with the aim of abolishing animal testing for cosmetic ingredients and combinations of ingredients, we need to do that in a way that does not compromise consumers' health and safety, which is the primary objective of legislation in the field. Many of the 8,000 existing cosmetic ingredients are rarely used, and some are not used at all. There are also occasional safety concerns about existing ingredients. For example, animal testing was recently used to prove beyond doubt that several ingredients that had had the finger pointed at them as potential endocrine disruptors were not endocrine disruptors and were safe for use in cosmetics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cosmetics industry is not static but innovative. Therefore, the need for a safety assessment of new ingredients is paramount before new products can be placed on the market. For example, soaps containing anti-microbial agents would not be on the market today if the new active ingredients had not been tested on animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thirdly, we agree strongly with the aim of abolishing animal testing of cosmetic ingredients and combinations of ingredients, as soon as it is practicable. However, we are committed to pursuing that objective without compromising consumers' health and safety or infringing UK and EU international obligations. We therefore support the approach in the seventh amendment, which links the ban on the testing of ingredients to the availability of non-animal alternative tests that have been published and validated by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That will serve as a spur to the industry to speed up existing work on the development of non-animal tests, while ensuring that ingredients that may be beneficial to consumers can continue to be developed. Within the past two years, new UV filters have been approved under the cosmetics directive for use in Europe under the cosmetics directive and were subject to safety assessment by the SCCNFP before manufacturers could use them. The safety assessment would have included animal tests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The seventh amendment text reinforces the regulatory framework to ensure the mandatory use of alternatives wherever they exist, including those that permit a reduction in the number of animals used or in the level of pain they might experience. However, the text makes it clear that any testing method entailing the use of animals cannot be accepted if a validated method exists that gives an equivalent level of assurance of safety but does not entail the use of animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Linking the use of alternatives to OECD validation and publication is an improvement on early proposals. Previously, the seventh amendment required validation and publication of non-animal alternative tests by the European centre for the validation of alternative methods. However, the OECD is an internationally recognised body. Validation and publication by the OECD will help to demonstrate that appropriately high levels of consumer health and safety can be met while continuing to reduce levels of animal testing. Equally importantly, OECD validation and publication will better ensure wider international acceptance of the EU's ethical concerns and is fully in line with the EU's commitments to promote animal welfare internationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By proceeding in a scientifically based and transparent way, we are more likely to persuade other major cosmetic producing countries to reduce or abolish animal testing than by proceeding with an immediate ban on marketing, which would be perceived as inherently protectionist and would be counter-productive to our important aim of working towards higher standards of animal welfare worldwide. That is especially important when states such as the United States, Switzerland and Japan— major suppliers to the EU market—require manufacturers of cosmetic products to produce animal testing data to demonstrate that their products will not harm the health and safety of consumers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are timing uncertainties as to when we will reach a state that is equivalent to the sixth amendment's marketing ban. After careful consideration of the current state of scientific knowledge and the experience gained over the past 10 years of research and development of alternatives to animal testing, we have concluded that it is impossible to predict with any degree of certainty when all the necessary testing methods that do not require the use of animals will be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most importantly for our discussion, the present text represents a significant step in the right direction towards adopting a measure suitable to replace the unimplemented sixth amendment to the cosmetics directive. Should the seventh amendment fail to come into force by 30 June, the sixth amendment will become law. Superficially, that might seem to be a good thing, but the marketing ban within the sixth amendment has major downsides that are incompatible with our World Trade Organisation obligations. That is not only the Government's view; it is the informed opinion of the EU Commission, the Council of Ministers and the majority of member states. The House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee accepted the Government's detailed arguments on that in July 2001.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sixth amendment to the cosmetics directive was passed in the early 1990s, prior to the entry into force of the WTO agreement on 1 January 1995. The marketing prohibition within the sixth amendment would affect the development of new ingredients within the EU and prevent the import of cosmetics products containing new ingredients into the EU. There is a strong risk that that would be seen to be a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0437">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
protectionist measure and would be challenged by countries that currently export cosmetics to the EU. Although the legal position is unclear, as it so often is, the consensus of legal advice is clear. If a marketing ban were introduced and challenged in the WTO, it is likely to be found in breach of WTO rules and a dispute panel would probably find it unjustifiable under the permitted exceptions. Importantly, Government policy requires that, although trade considerations cannot be the sole determinant of the Government's objectives, it is essential that United Kingdom and EU policies are framed in full knowledge of our WTO obligations and are designed to withstand WTO challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The compatibility of the sixth amendment is extremely uncertain, so a marketing ban would be counter-productive to long-term concern about welfare standards worldwide and the UK Government should seek to avoid it ever coming into effect. The text for the seventh amendment would considerably reduce the risk of a challenge, and improve our ability to present a credible defence if challenged. It will not cut across our longer-term efforts to persuade others throughout the world to adopt higher standards of animal welfare. If it is agreed by other member states, it will immediately extend the testing ban on finished products, which is already voluntary in the United Kingdom, throughout the EU. A testing ban on new ingredients, whether they are developed in the EU or elsewhere, will be introduced gradually in a scientifically valid way that maintains health and safety standards and allows the development of new ingredients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ultimate effect of the seventh amendment is comparable to that of the sixth, and I hope that the Committee will support it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 am for questions. I remind members of the Committee that questions should be brief. If hon. Members wish to ask several questions, there should be ample opportunity for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Waterson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Eastbourne)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two linked questions that relate to the Minister's letter of 4 February to the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee about alternative tests. The Minister wrote helpfully that some alternatives had been found, although not many—only two or three. The letter said that work was proceeding on four or five further tests. However, even if that is taken at face value, what does the Minister understand to be the latest position on the other nine tests out of the total of 14 that are currently used on animals?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, will the Minister tell us about the dangers to consumers that she has been advised will occur because of the absence of valid alternatives to all but two of the tests?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are 14 tests in total. As the hon. Gentleman suggested, the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods—ECVAM— has validated alternative tests for skin corrosion and phototoxicity. There is a validated OECD alternative
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
to a test for mutagenicity. However, draft guidelines await OECD acceptance on alternatives for five of the existing tests. Work has started on achieving validation for four further tests. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the European Commission is working on a timetable for a work programme that will address alternatives to the remaining tests. Obviously, there is a lot to be learned about the development of the tests, but progress is being made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about risks to consumers. If non-animal testing alternatives are not available, animal testing will continue to be used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Iain Luke 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dundee, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister outlined the timetable of the amendments. If the seventh amendment is not made European law by June, the sixth amendment will become law, which will open up WTO challenges. There is an indication that there will be a Second Reading at the European Parliament. Has that occurred, or is it timetabled?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give only limited help to my hon. Friend by telling him that we are not aware that the European Parliament has fixed a date for Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Teignbridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us the size and predicted growth of the market? She referred to cosmetics tests forming only 0.3 per cent. of all animal tests. I do not know what that figure entails in terms of the world market. Does the Minister have the figures available? How will future growth proceed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is encouraging me to be a market analyst, but I shall do my best to tell him the current state of play.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cosmetics, toiletry and perfumery market— cosmetics is widely defined; the market is wider than make-up items—in the UK in 1999 was estimated at retail sales of £4.9 billion. The US continues to be the UK's largest and most important market external to the EU for finished cosmetic products. It had £175 million-worth of exports and £199 million-worth of imports in 2000. Those figures exclude soap—and probably the microbial soap that I still cannot pronounce, despite being sent a note about how to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the imports go to UK companies appointed as European distributors by US principals, and that adds to the UK plc figures. Imports from Switzerland total £60 million and those from the USA total £214 million. The EU is an important export market for both those countries, and that, no doubt, will influence their concerns about the sixth amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we were to go ahead with the seventh amendment—under which there would be a ban if an alternative test were available—rather than the sixth amendment with its blanket ban, would there be a risk that people might be discouraged from developing alternatives? While there are no alternatives, companies can carry on as they always have done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend. There is a serious risk that we would remove the incentive to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0438">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
develop alternatives. One of our aims is to get the development of alternatives into an international setting through OECD mechanisms. That will provide something to which non-EU and EU members can sign up. We are one of the good guys; we have undertaken a ban on such testing in the UK. Others in the EU, such as Denmark, appear to take a more radical position in their domestic arrangements but are not in nearly such a good position as we are. We need to be seen to lead the way and must do so in an international setting to make sure that the tests are developed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If that is the case, has she any plans to move the process forward and try to achieve the objectives of organisations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and other animal welfare organisations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that those organisations will move their positions forward themselves. We are in regular contact with them about these matters. It is important that we get the seventh amendment accepted, but it obviously needs to go through the European parliamentary procedures. That is a crucial step if it is to be adopted. It is worrying that we have not yet got a date for Second Reading, and we will consider whether we can make sure that one is fixed soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must work with the EU countries that have already adopted a positive stance on the issue, namely Austria, the Netherlands and Germany. Like the UK, which has a voluntary ban, those countries have introduced testing bans for cosmetics. We must work with them to build greater support so that we can move the EU in the right direction. At the moment, there are very different views in the EU, and there is outright opposition to much of what we are arguing for. If we tried to move ahead, we would not get support in the problems that would result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Devon)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that the UK is taking a lead. I have no doubt that that is a good thing, but has she any evidence that taking the lead disadvantages British companies by causing them additional costs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may well be that the WTO would challenge the EU. So, too, might members of the WTO, the most obvious of which is the US, which would have difficulties with the amendment. It would be seen as a protectionist measure by the US for the reasons that I have given about the nature of imports and exports to that country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to ask for international standards to which the EU was incapable of adhering, that would seem unreasonable to countries outside the EU.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Therefore, it is important that we put our own house in order before we make demands on others.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whatever the arguments in respect of the art of the possible in this context, does the Minister accept that the current wording is significantly weaker than the amended wording that was agreed in 1993?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not, for the reasons that I gave in my opening statement. The current wording is a marked improvement on the sixth amendment and on the earlier wording, because it gives us more to build on and more guarantees that the progress that the UK wishes to see will be attained, with regard to a ban on the testing of cosmetics on animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Andrew Murrison 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Westbury)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that the difficulty that the Minister was experiencing had to do with the difference between microbial and microbiol.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have something here that is called microbol, but we will not debate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the various substances that might be classified as cosmetics, and they all sounded right and proper. We all understand what is a cosmetic; it includes perfumes, and it might even include toothpaste, which some would say is not essential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Minister said that sunblocks are included, and that worries me. These days, we are increasingly aware of the importance of the prevention of malignant melanoma, particularly with regard to children. Would it be possible to divorce sunblocks from the bulk of what we would understand to be cosmetics? There is a clear difference between sunblocks and some of the other products to which the Minister referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know how much scope there is for redefining the term "cosmetics". As the hon. Gentleman said, the term covers items such as toothpaste, shaving cream, sunscreen, sunblocks and baby care products. It includes many things that are put on the skin in one way or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a definition of what constitutes a cosmetic product: it includes items used for the purpose of cleaning, perfuming, changing appearance, protecting, and keeping various parts of the body in good working order. It is a long definition, and I can supply it to the hon. Gentleman, if he so wishes. I suspect that it is inevitable that the definition will cover sunblocks and, therefore, it might not be possible to disaggregate them from the items covered by the directive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Non-animal tests have to be validated, and the data to validate them usually comes from animal tests. Can the Minister assure me that nothing in these amendments will restrict the work that needs to be done to develop the non-animal tests, even if that work requires the use of animals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a technical question, and my hon. Friend is right to ask it. My answer is that I hope that that will be the case, although I do not have the evidence in front of me to give him a cast iron guarantee. I assume that it will be the case, but I would like to reassure my hon. Friend, so I shall write to him about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my previous question, I was trying to get at the number of experiments, in particular with regard to the size of the market. If the argument is going to be won in the wider world, it is important to bring to its attention how many animals are affected, and to contrast what we do in the EU with what happens in the United States of America.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the impact on the EU market. If the seventh amendment is adopted, will that put our market at a disadvantage, in relation to imports from outside the EU? I do not know the cost difference between non-animal experiments and animal-based experiments, but if our market will be put at a disadvantage, should we not take measures to protect it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that it puts our market at a disadvantage. It is clear that there are no economic issues with regard to this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not have the data on the number of animal tests. Cosmetics firms will not share that data with us, so it is impossible for us to get it. However, as I have said, only a small percentage of the tests that are carried out on animals in Europe are conducted for the purpose of testing cosmetics ingredients. At present, 0.3 per cent. of animal tests undertaken in Europe are for cosmetic purposes in the wider sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Luke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend referred to the correspondence last year between the European Scrutiny Committee and her Department. On 9 January 2002, there was discussion about the legal advice that had been received. What legal advice was given? We are not prohibiting the importation of cosmetics, but setting standards that may make it slightly more difficult for companies to export their products to us. That is different from a complete trade ban. There has been a straight prohibition of steel imports in America. Will my hon. Friend go into more detail about the legal technicalities that were put to her?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will understand that it is not possible for me to go into detail about the legal advice that we received, because it could prejudice the outcome of a WTO case, if one arose. The sixth amendment would cause a problem with the WTO rules and would be incompatible with them, whereas the seventh amendment is more likely to be acceptable to the WTO and much less likely to invite challenge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ivan Henderson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harwich)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The incentive is that the OECD will be looking for alternatives and will ensure that they are developed. It is up to member states to maintain pressure through the EU and the OECD to ensure that those alternatives are developed. We want the tests to be developed as soon as is practicable and will exert pressures to make sure that the process continues. There is always the risk that people will drag their heels, but it is up to us to make sure that progress is made and we shall be doing our best to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Swire</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison). Will the Minister dwell on the distinction that he made between cosmetics that enhance, such as perfumes, fragrances and toothpastes and preventive products that have real medical connotations, such as sunblocks? Some of us would be happy to allow greater flexibility in areas that have greater medical connotations than in areas of cosmetic enhancement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: understand the point raised by the hon. Gentlemen, but whether tests that are used for certain areas can be used for other areas is probably beyond me technically and may be beyond them, too. If tests used for one area can be adapted for use in other areas and there are not separate requirements, we may be able to cover the continuing use of sunblock, for example, as easily as we could by disaggregating the two products, thus covering those cosmetics about which the hon. Gentlemen are not so concerned. We cannot make such a distinction within the scope of the directive. We would probably have to change it and we might not gain anything by doing that, although I sympathise with the objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to my previous question about the WTO, if the sixth amendment were adopted rather than the seventh, and there were a challenge within the WTO—as the Minister suggested would be likely— what would be the scenario within Europe? Although the Minister said that we would be in danger of losing the progress made to date in restricting animal testing, surely the status quo would prevail within the EU and we would be no worse off?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the seventh amendment were not adopted, we would fall back to being uncertain about the industry's future. It would be difficult for us to find a way ahead in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggests. Legal argument is not a productive outcome for anyone. It is expensive, time-consuming and leads to a time vacuum, as I explained when I last spoke about this subject. I fear that we would return to the position in which there was continued uncertainty for many years and no progress was made on developing non-animal testing or on a ban. It would be foolish to enter into a state in which it was likely that legal proceedings would be taken, when we can pursue a course that will have the same effect but involve much less risk.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the concern expressed by some organisations that EU multinationals will simply circumvent the provisions by commissioning tests outside the EU while continuing to manufacture and sell their products within the EU?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Assuming that the European Parliament adopts the seventh amendment—although the debate has not yet concluded—the test developed will be used and required within the EU for activity within the EU. Therefore, those wishing to import will be required to meet the standards adopted by the EU, just as products created within the EU will have to meet the standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The standards adopted by the EU will be internationally accepted. If tests that do not involve
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0440">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
animals are developed, many companies and countries will wish to adopt them. I do not believe there to be a lack of sensitivity on the subject. Although there has been a reluctance to move forward, that reluctance can be overcome by the availability of externally validated, internationally accepted tests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Murrison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Minister on the difference between sunblocks and cosmetics? I am sorry to be vexatious, but I am warming to the theme. It is wrong to include sunblocks in the broader group of cosmetic products. All Opposition Members would agree that most people understand cosmetics to include perfumes and so forth—toothpaste, at a stretch—and there is no way that such products should be tested on animals. We are quite clear about that—no problem at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have difficulty, however, in accepting the duplicity of the Government's message. On one hand, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Public Health says that prevention is very important, but on the other hand, this legislation would in some ways increase the difficulty of prevention. Incidences of malignant melanoma are increasing and we approach summer, when the problem is especially acute. Is the time right to disaggregate sunblocks from the raft of perfumes and toiletries that comprise the core subject of today's discussion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may be warming to his subject, but I feel that it may be getting a little overexposed. Sunblocks will be continue to be available following testing on animals while non-animal tests are not validated. When non-animal tests are validated, sunblocks will be produced on that basis. There is no continuing risk. The Government are not duplicitous in their message about the importance of protecting people, especially children, from the sun when they are in the UK and abroad to ensure the result that skin cancer is kept to a minimum. Skin cancer is a growing problem and the creams play an important role in achieving that result. I accept the hon. Gentleman's point about the importance of the creams, but nothing is put at risk by the proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What opposition exists in the EU to the sixth amendment? If there is opposition, what reasons have been given for that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that question because it allows me to highlight that there is less than full support throughout the EU. Austria, the Netherlands and Germany are the only countries apart from the UK that have introduced a testing ban on cosmetics. That sets the scene in the first place. Denmark has neither a voluntary nor legal ban on animal testing, but it wishes to impose a ban on non-EU countries that sell cosmetics in the EU that have been tested on animals. That is a contradictory position. Alliances with other countries show that only a few member states are prepared to support our position, and other countries refuse to move to the extent that we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will agree that the future of the manufacturing industry in this country lies largely with knowledge-based and advanced
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
products. In the pharmaceutical industry and, I believe, the cosmetic industry, it is generally accepted that a customer does not buy a physical product but the intellectual effort that was involved in its development. If the Minister agrees with that, does she agree that a product that is tested on animals is not the same as a product that might do the same thing, but that was developed by a different intellectual process? If she agrees with me about that, should we challenge the WTO, which bans discrimination against similar products, about that by telling it that a product that is developed by a more advanced, non-animal technique is not a similar product because it has a different intellectual background and, therefore, a consumer purchases a different intellectual property?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has a nice argument. However, I am sure that WTO lawyers would spend hours and, indeed, years examining it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does it justify steel tariffs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not want to go down the line of steel tariffs. The Government's position on that is very clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to make progress. The idea that the product is different is open to great argument because, at the end of the day, it could be the same finished product with the same ingredients. My hon. Friend will accept that the way in which his argument may be developed could result in disagreements about whether the outcome was different or the same.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister develop the argument of the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright) about the impact of accepting the sixth amendment rather than moving forward with the seventh? She said that non-animal tests would not take place, but she also said that two are in place, one is nearly in place and five are in hand—I make that eight out of 14, which is the majority. If the sixth amendment were adopted, what would stop the further development of those? How long would we have before there was a challenge to the WTO, and for how long would the marketing ban be in place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, there is not EU support for the sixth amendment. That basic point must be made. We would not gain support for it across the EU whatever we argued. On the tests, I would not want the hon. Gentleman to leave with the impression that everything is fully developed. Some tests are being validated, a couple have been validated, and some are still to be done. Work on those will take time; we do not know long, but we will encourage speed from those involved. We cannot be sure about the time. It is not the case that the tests are a semi-done deal. Work still needs to be done in key areas, and we want to make sure that it happens as quickly as is practicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the likely effect of entering into a legal dispute, I can only reiterate that we would be in an uncomfortable position in which no progress was made on non-animal tests. The dispute would also be very uncomfortable. We do not want to be involved in trade disputes unless we are forced to. We cannot predict, but we think that the challenge could take as long as two or three years. That would lead to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0441">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We debated that at considerable length earlier. I regret that I cannot remember whether the hon. Gentleman was present on that occasion. In any event, we lifted the reserve because it was necessary to do so. We are concerned for the parliamentary and scrutiny process to go through. If we had not been able to vote in favour of the proposal at the Internal Market Council on 26 November, the compromise text that we were offered would have fallen. It is important that we pass these various hurdles, and that we do so by June. We must make sure that the process takes place. Such processes can take time. Had the text fallen in November, there would have been little chance of reaching any agreement by June.

	<p>
	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of the unnumbered explanatory memorandum dated 14th November 2001 from the Department of Trade and Industry on the amended draft Directive of the European Parliament and the Council amending for the seventh time Council Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of member states relating to cosmetic products; and welcomes it as a positive step towards maintaining the current high levels of protection for human health and safety whilst promoting animal welfare.—[
	<i>Miss Johnson.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>11.20 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Waterson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I belatedly say, Mr. Benton, that it is a pleasure to be serving under your chairmanship? We have had a useful set of questions and answers, and they have helped to clarify several issues. However, I wish to raise a couple of further points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has highlighted three potential conflicts. First, a balance must be struck between consumer health and animal welfare. A balance must also be struck between the protection of animals and the World Trade Organisation issue, to which I wish to return. On a procedural note—it is all very well for the Minister to say that she has debated the matter before—it is unfortunate that the scrutiny reserve was lifted. That is not only my opinion; it is clearly the opinion of the Scrutiny Committee and its redoubtable
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Chairman, and it was also unfortunate that the relevant letter did not arrive from the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That matter raises issues about the scrutiny procedures in the House, and how seriously they are taken by the Executive because, on any view, this measure represents a watering down of the original amendment. In a nutshell, what is being said is, "Politics is the art of the possible, and because we could not get through that which we think is ideal, we are supporting this amendment." That is what is being said; I accept that I have paraphrased the argument, so I have not done justice to all of its strands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such debates are taking place against a background of continually decreasing numbers of experiments carried out on animals in the UK. I am sure that we are all pleased about that trend. With regard to that, the Library brief is helpful; it explains the trend in detail. It states that the number of procedures on animals has fallen by over 80,000 since 1989, and that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Safety and efficacy testing of pharmaceutical products and pharmaceutical quality control accounted for over 60% of these procedures."</p></blockquote>
As the Minister has made clear, only a small percentage of such procedures were carried out for the purpose of testing cosmetics. Since November 1997, no licences have been issued for cosmetic finished-product testing, and the existing licences were amended to exclude that. I understand that 1999 was the first year when no such procedures were carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the Minister's statement that we are ahead of other countries in the EU. However, as always in the EU, there is the question of whether, like a wartime convoy, we travel at the speed of the fastest or the slowest ship. In light of the history that is well-documented in the relevant papers, it appears that some countries have been dragging their feet for several years, which is why we are ending up with what, on any view—I think that the Minister would accept this—is a compromise that takes account of the current political realities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, as all hon. Members know, many of our constituents have strong feelings about animal testing, of whatever sort. With regard to animal welfare, the previous Conservative Government's attitude was that there was little point in having excellent rules, procedures and protections in this country if we could not carry with us the other European countries, some of which had a rather different approach, historically, to animal welfare. I understand that it is still the case that about 3,000 primates, for example, are used to test medicines or vaccines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth mentioning that as long ago as 1997 the Labour party—which was then in Opposition— made a manifesto pledge to set up a royal commission on animal welfare, presumably to cover issues such as that which we are currently debating. That pledge has yet to be redeemed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we are discussing a specific draft amended directive, this is the sort of issue where it is helpful to stand back and look at the entire subject of animal experiments and welfare. I mentioned many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0442">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
constituents' concerns, but most reasonable people would accept that products, especially pharmaceutical products, should be tested before being used by humans and that, when appropriate, animal testing should be used in such circumstances. Most people would not argue with that principle. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury said, a distinction is to be drawn between some cosmetics in the pure sense and others. The definition that the Minister read out was pretty wide and went way beyond what I believe might be considered to be cosmetics. Nevertheless, there is a strong feeling, which I share, that it is both cruel and frivolous seriously to consider animal testing for cosmetics. That is why we have had a voluntary ban since 1997.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment under consideration owes its genesis to the Belgian presidency, which clearly put a lot of effort into trying to find a compromise solution. I shall not go into detail, but in the minutes of evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee of 9 January 2002, the Minister helpfully described the background to the decision. The Chairman of that Committee asked her:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why did the Government not ask for a vote to be deferred until a later meeting in order for the House to give its views first?"</p></blockquote>
The European Scrutiny Committee recommended a debate in Committee—which, it might be argued, is happening slightly belatedly today—and said that it expected the Government to maintain a scrutiny reserve until that debate had taken place. We now know that, in the meantime, Ministers removed the scrutiny reserve. At the time, that was linked to the question of when the Second Reading debate would be held in the European Parliament. However, we learn this morning not only that that has not taken place but that a date has not even been fixed for it. The European Scrutiny Committee must, not unreasonably, feel rather sore about how it has been handled by the Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The potential conflict between consumer health and animal welfare relates to the question of alternative tests, on which we touched. The RSPCA figures that the Minister cited show that tests on cosmetic ingredients account for only about 0.3 per cent. of all animal tests undertaken throughout Europe. As she says in her letter of 4 February to the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee about finding alternative, non-animal tests:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The timescale for success remains uncertain."</p></blockquote>
She refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the importance of continuing efforts to agree international standards for validation of alternatives—via the OECD—as a major means of reducing the volume of testing on animals worldwide."</p></blockquote>
That must surely be right. However, having said that, she helpfully goes on to say—I believe that an even more helpful report is lodged in the Library, and I am sure that most Members have idly flicked through it before this sitting—that some 14 tests are routinely used for assessing the safety of cosmetic ingredients. Only two—the skin corrosion and the phototoxicity tests—have been validated by ECVAM, to which the Minister referred.

There is an OECD alternative to a third test, for mutagenicity, and guidelines are awaited on alternatives for five existing tests. As she said, work has started on achieving validation for four others. However, that means that for the great majority of the tests, there is currently no viable alternative to animal testing. I believe that this morning she described the position as in her letter of 4 February. Nothing much has changed since that letter was written. A clear consensus is developing in the Committee that people will have no incentive to find such alternatives if the amended directive is passed in its present state. Anxiety has been expressed about that, and it is only right to register that on behalf of the Opposition.

Scepticism was expressed in the European Scrutiny Committee about the WTO. As the Minister will know, having received several letters on the subject, the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, for example, expressed concern about the legal advice received by the Minister. I appreciate that Ministers do not usually reveal legal advice that they have received, but in the past the Minister has been referred to advice obtained by BUAV by Professor Philippe Sands, who revels in the title of global professor of law at New York university and professor of international law at the University of London. He recently said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the current state of WTO law enables the EU to advance cogent and persuasive arguments that it could, consistently with the WTO obligations of the European Communities and its Member States, adopt a ban on the sale in the EU of cosmetics that have been tested on animals after a specified date in the future".</p></blockquote>
As a lawyer, I recognise that having three lawyers in a room is liable to result in three different opinions. However, having read the papers relatively recently, and considering the European Scrutiny Committee's obvious concerns, my feeling is that a respectable argument is to be made in the WTO.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us not run away with the idea that the WTO is a purist organisation made up of jurists and people who will make a decision in the cool light of case law. There is a lot of politics in the WTO. The hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) mentioned steel tariffs. If we are to believe the newspapers—I believe everything that I read in the newspapers—the United States' decision to impose steel tariffs is, at least in part, motivated by some key mid-term elections in some steel producing areas in the USA. That may or may not be true, but there will always be a political dimension to the WTO. The Government are, rightly, being rather robust about the imposition of steel tariffs by the USA. Why are they not more robust in making the case in this instance against the WTO argument?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Americans may make a short-term decision on steel tariffs knowing that it could be several years before the issue is sorted out in the WTO, by which time the mid-term elections will be simply a happy memory. However, that is the playing field on which such WTO matters are played out, and I wish that the Government would take a more robust line on the WTO. Perhaps another option might be to persuade the estimable and highly successful business man Mr. Mittal to go into the cosmetics business. That might be another way to achieve the same thing.

It has been a useful discussion so far. Those are the three main issues about which we have anxieties. We believe as a party that it is right to have a voluntary ban in the UK. We are in principle opposed to testing cosmetics on animals. The next Conservative Government would support a total test ban throughout the EU and on any cosmetics, including those imported anywhere in the EU that have been tested on animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have a policy for honesty in labelling, a point to which the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth referred. All products should have clear labels about animal testing. Some companies include such commercial information as, these days, it is a selling point to say that no animals have been involved in testing a product. We believe that that should be a blanket requirement. We have three main anxieties about the directive, and I look forward to what hon. Members have to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Richard Younger-Ross</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief. The cosmetics market is growing. It is clear from magazines that such products—whether sanitary or for vanity—are being pushed more and more. Even men use them; not only when they appear on television, but even to stop the shine on their foreheads when under the bright lights in the House. Animal testing affects many people. Concern is felt throughout the country about it, but I do not know whether people's vanity makes them buy the stuff without realising the intellectual basis of the products and whether the products have been tested on animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The WTO should be challenged; that would be a way forward. We have a legal argument about testing, but it is a shame to duck the issue and not have a total ban. Many people are in favour of that, and of a more robust approach being taken. I understand the practicalities outlined by the Minister, but we must move forward to a total test ban. While we do not have such a ban, it is important that we have clear labelling. Companies such as The Body Shop market their animal-free testing products extremely well. Such an approach should be taken throughout the industry. We should know what products have been tested on animals and what products have not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Wright</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I applaud the Government's action on animal welfare in the short time that they have been in office. It is a bit tongue in cheek for the Opposition to suggest that, all of a sudden, they have become friends of the animal kingdom. During 18 years in power, Conservative Members did nothing in that respect. However, we shall find out on Monday how much they support animal welfare. I am extremely uncomfortable with the proposal, because I take the line that fur coats are worn by beautiful animals and by ugly people. In this day and age, we should not allow testing on animals for any cosmetic products. We should push that view. However, I understand the Government's explanation and I am willing to go some way with them on it and, hopefully, they may campaign for an
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
outright ban. The United Kingdom seems to be the leader in animal welfare. We have banned pig tethering in the farming industry, while it exists in the rest of Europe. We have taken on board other animal issues, too, yet we seem to be afraid of pushing such matters forward on to the world stage. I wish that we had it within ourselves to say, "Yes, the United Kingdom believes in such issues" and to challenge the world organisations. I am saddened that we are not challenging the WTO and pushing forward the sixth amendment, rather than adopting the seventh amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talked about consumer health versus animal welfare. It is not possible to put those two issues together in a discussion about cosmetics. There may be an argument in the medical world, but we are in danger of overstepping our rights to take decisions as sentient beings. Having said that, I am prepared to accept the seventh amendment as a move in the right direction, but wish to register my sadness in doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that I speak for many hon. Members when I say that there should be a worldwide outright ban on animal testing. The directive is one step on that road. I will not rest until the day that we have an outright ban on animal testing throughout the world. If that is not accepted, there should be no market in the United Kingdom or the EU for products tested on animals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Miss Johnson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for their contributions to the debate. We have had a useful discussion of the issues. I will tackle some of the questions raised in the closing remarks of those hon. Members who contributed in the last stage of the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth and the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross) both mentioned challenging the WTO. The question is not whether we challenge the WTO, but of us belonging to the WTO and working within its rules. The challenge would come from another WTO member should we pursue a course of action in contravention of its rules. The Government have always framed policy development in full knowledge of WTO rules and to withstand challenge, which is an important factor in guiding the way in which we have moved forward on this subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) that we must balance human health and animal welfare. However, I also agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth that animal welfare is important. Indeed, the hon. Member for Eastbourne will be tested on future occasions, not least on Monday, on his views and those of his colleagues on animal welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to be clear for the benefit of my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth; the Government wish to see no animal testing whenever practicable alternatives are available. With every enthusiasm and motivation, we encourage others to move forward in developing alternatives to tests. We must be clear about why the reserve was lifted. I reiterate the points that I made to the European Scrutiny Committee on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2001-2002V011P0I0444">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
9 January. Had we not lifted the reserve when we did, no progress would have been made at the November Internal Market Council, which would have risked the common position falling into disarray.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it is, we have an amendment to put before the EU. We cannot guarantee that the European Parliament will adopt the seventh amendment, but we will do all that we can to secure a Second Reading for it and to ensure that the process goes ahead on the agreed timeframe. It is important that we do that so that the amendment to the directive is adopted and we may move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Eastbourne was right to say that we are talking about the art of the possible. We can move ahead in Europe only if we have sufficient support from other member states. That was the reason behind the Belgian presidency's work to produce the compromise text and it is among the reasons why we have decided to move forward as we have. As I have said, if we move ahead in the EU in a way that seems to be protectionist, we will not only fall foul of WTO rules, but raise questions about why we are behaving in such a way when we should be developing measures that could be accepted internationally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the hon. Member for Eastbourne's comments about progress on testing since 1998. This Government introduced the voluntary ban on testing in the UK and the changes in licensing arrangements, although I believe that the ban on testing was introduced in 1999, not 1998. The hon. Gentleman
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
rightly mentioned putting three lawyers in a room, but his point about three legal opinions emerging might be an underestimate. We could get four, five or more legal opinions from putting those lawyers in a room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to draw an exact parallel with the question of steel tariffs, and that is why we must adopt the position that we have on cosmetics. We were right to condemn strongly the United States for imposing tariffs to protect a domestic industry. We believe that the US is contravening WTO rules. However, it would be hypocritical of the UK and the EU to try to get a marketing ban while knowing that all the legal advice that we have received from the Commission, our advisers and other quarters says that that would contravene WTO rules. We are acting consistently to promote animal welfare and to try to achieve the results in the UK that Labour Members, especially, want as quickly as is practical.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
