	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment (Ms Margaret Hodge)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Tax Credit (New Category of Child Care Provider) Regulations 1999.</p></blockquote>
I am glad to be serving under your fair and equitable chairmanship, Mr. Jones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The working families tax credit and the disabled persons tax credit were introduced on 5 October 1999. They will replace the family credit and the disability working allowance. The WFTC and the disabled persons tax credit include a child care tax credit. To qualify for the child care tax credit, families will need to meet the general qualifying conditions and they will have to use eligible child care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rules on eligible child care focus almost entirely on child care for the under-eights. We have raised the children's age limit for help with child care cost to 14, which is in line with the national child care strategy, and to under 16 for disabled children. Very little in the rules caters for child care for that older age group, who have very different needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The older group of children need breakfast, after-school and holiday clubs, and such child care is increasingly available and can be run by a variety of organisations. Our national child care strategy encourages the development of those new facilities. The growing participation of mothers and fathers in the labour market means that demand for such out-of-school child care is expanding rapidly. The diversity of child care that is provided for older children means that no common feature exists to separate appropriate good quality providers from inappropriate ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, we took powers under section 15 of the Tax Credits Act 1999 to enable the Secretary of State to make regulations to create the category of good-quality providers. That category covers those who provide child care for children who are aged eight and over. We shall make that category eligible for child care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations will enable the Secretary of State to accredit appropriate organisations, which will be able to administer an approval system for child care providers. Details of the scheme are contained in the regulations, which also set out the minimum standards that child care providers will need to meet to gain the approval of accredited organisations. The powers will come into effect in April 2000. Parents of older children who meet the WFTC qualifying conditions can claim child care tax credit for the child care that they receive from approved providers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The regulations will apply throughout the United Kingdom, although the function of approving accredited organisations will be executively devolved to Scottish Ministers and to the National Assembly for Wales. There will be no accreditation scheme in Northern Ireland because its system for regulating child care already covers older children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Committee's attention to the main provisions of the regulations. Regulation 5 sets out the criteria for accrediting quality assurance schemes and regulations 7, 8, 9 and 10 and schedule 2 set out the way in which accreditation should be applied for, withdrawn and renewed. Schedule 1 sets out those matters that an organisation that applies for accreditation will need to include in the approval system. Regulation 11 sets out the requirements that accredited organisations will need to meet during the period of accreditation. That includes the provision of information to the Inland Revenue, the maintenance of records and a requirement, if necessary, to allow the Secretary of State or his nominee to attend meetings of the accredited organisation's approval panel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 14 and schedule 3 set out the minimum criteria that a child care provider must meet to be approved by an accredited Organisation. We expect that organisations will include those conditions in their own criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme was welcomed by the main child care organisations and by other groups, whose views were sought early in the year. In September, we also issued draft guidance to organisations that may be interested in applying for accreditation. We have received eight expressions of interest from organisations in England that wish to seek accreditation from the Secretary of State, including local authorities and registered charities that cover the out-of-school care and child-minding sectors. Scotland and Wales expect a smaller number of applications because they have fewer child care providers who cater for the older age group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations are to be welcomed and I commend them to the Committee. They will increase the number of families who will be eligible for the child care tax credit element of the WFTC and the disabled persons tax credit. They represent a better deal for working families by making work pay, providing help for families on the lowest incomes and tackling poverty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. James Clappison 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hertsmere)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I associate myself with the Minister's remarks and welcome you, Mr. Jones, to the Chair this afternoon? It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. As the Minister said, the parent Bill for the regulations, which have come before the Committee by way of affirmative resolution, is the Tax Credits Act 1999. The proposed new category for tax credit purposes, of child care provider that the hon. Lady described was introduced at a relatively late stage during that Act's passage through the House. Some have said that the provisions are complex compared with existing provisions for under-eights. As she herself noted, different considerations apply for over-eights than under-eights, who are dealt with under provisions relating to the registration of child minders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0502">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
For those and other reasons, it is entirely appropriate for the regulations to come before this Committee and be subject to affirmative resolution. Without wishing to introduce an undue element of topicality or controversy, I note in passing that it is members of another place, including at least one hereditary peer, whom we should thank for persuading the Government that the regulations should be debated and subject to affirmative resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have several questions to ask the Minister. Our paramount concern, which I would imagine that she shares, is safety. I make no apologies for covering ground that may have been covered elsewhere, because we need to be as vigilant as possible with regard to child safety.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As was said, this is a new system for children aged eight or over. Parents of under-eights may claim child care tax credit where the carer concerned is a registered child minder and an established, well-known local authority registration system is already in place. The new system approaches those issues in a different way. Child care providers for over-eights will be approved by an accredited organisation's awarding panel. In other words, there will be a two-tier system, consisting of the awarding panel, which will look at the case of a particular child care provider, and the accredited organisation, of which the panel must form a part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that proposition in mind, will child care providers who will seek approval under the new system be subject to the disqualification from working with children regulations? Will the accredited organisations' awarding panels be able to check whether would-be child care providers have criminal convictions? That is especially important in cases involving people with convictions for sexual offences, violence or other ill-treatment of children. Will the awarding panels or accredited organisation have access to police criminal records? Furthermore, does the Minister expect that such checks will be carried out? Unhappily, the eight-to-15-year-old age group is particularly susceptible to the attentions of evil people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What steps will be taken to monitor the provision of child care by approved providers once they have been established, especially in respect of health and safety? The Minister told us that members of her Department will be able to participate in the awarding panels. Will she tell us about the next stage of child care? Once approval has been given to a child care provider, it is important to oversee the quality and safety of the care that is provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third schedule of the regulations, which deals with criteria for the approval of child care providers, states that the provider has to
	<br><blockquote><p>"agree to allow quality assessors and representatives of the accredited organisation, of the Secretary of State and of the Inland Revenue access at any reasonable time to the child care provider's premises and records."</p></blockquote>
Can the Minister explain how she envisages the Secretary of State going about the task of monitoring child care providers in the way that is specified in the schedule? For example, will an organisation, section or department within the Minister's Department be charged with monitoring child care providers who have received
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
approval for looking after children for a period of up to two years and have to return for subsequent approval? What types of checks will be carried out during that two-year period and how many assessors and representatives will be charged with the task? If the Minister cannot provide a detailed answer today, I should be grateful if she would write to me in due course. Meanwhile, I am sure that all members of the Committee would appreciate a general indication from the Minister of the steps that the Government propose to take in respect of this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister could provide an estimate of the numbers of organisations that are involved. I believe that she said that eight have come forward. Does she have any estimate of the number that may do so in the future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell us anything new about the potential costs? As she will be aware, a range of estimates have been produced. The Institute for Fiscal Studies gave a large estimate, while the Government's estimate, which was smaller, appeared in a record of earlier proceedings. What is the Government's most recent estimate of the cost of the child care tax credit and on what statistics and assumptions is it based? How many people are eligible to claim the credit and what is the estimated take-up rate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On those who are to be child care providers, as opposed to those who are looking to the services of child care providers to claim the tax credit, the Minister will know that hon. Members raised many questions about that subject at an earlier stage prior to the publication of the regulations. In cases involving disabled children, care may be provided in a child's own home by a specific person—if, for example, the home has been specially adapted for the care of that child. Will those who provide that sort of care be eligible for approval as child care providers, thereby generating a tax credit for the parents who pay for the care? We imagine that the Minister will want to respond on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more general point, is there any reason why neighbours should not register as child care providers to look after each other's children, thereby generating a tax credit? Could grandparents or other relatives be child care providers, thereby generating a tax credit? The Minister will be aware that, under section 71 of the Children Act 1989, the existing local authority provisions appear to prevent grandparents or other relatives from registering as child minders for under-eights. It would be helpful to know how the new system will treat grandparents and other relatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will families in which one parent goes out to work and the other stays at home be treated? Will the new system help families in which mothers stay at home to look after their own children, which many mothers wish to do?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been reflecting on what the Prime Minister said this afternoon. Would the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) like to explain how he would find the necessary funding to pay a child care tax credit to every parent who wanted to stay at home? Given the tax
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V007P0I0503">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
cuts that the Conservative party has proposed, how would it fund such a proposal were it to come into government?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The safety of children is of overriding importance to the Government and was at the forefront of our considerations when devising the accreditation scheme for the organisations that accredit individual child care providers. We would expect the quality assurance systems of such organisations to consider four key issues: first, health and safety, to which the hon. Member for Hertsmere referred; secondly, whether suitable, adequately trained people were employed in sufficent numbers for any given situation; thirdly, the quality of activity programmes provided; and, fourthly, equal opportunities for children, parents and staff. Although this is a light-touch regulation, it will cover those issues that are of greatest importance to the Government and Opposition, and will ensure the safety and well-being of children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hertsmere will know, we are also considering new proposals for the regulation, registration and inspection of all early-years education and child care. After consultation, we shall introduce proposals to ensure that the new body, which will have responsibility for such matters, has a duty to check the suitability of carers for the over-eights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On suitability, will the accredited organisations—or their awarding panels—be able to check the criminal records of carers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The establishment of the Criminal Records Bureau will bring together not only police records but those held by the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Employment, and the organisations will have access to those records. It is essential that they do so and we expect them to make those checks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: You expect them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That covers the first issue of safety for children. The second issue concerns the steps that we would take to monitor the approved providers. Again, within the system that is being established, we would expect the accrediting organisations to ensure that providers are inspected and accredited every two years for the purpose of the tax credits regulations. An inspection every two years is sufficient to ensure that quality is safeguarded. The providers for under-fives are currently inspected every year under social services regulations, but for the over-eights a lighter touch is appropriate and inspection every two years is sufficient monitoring. However, within the two-year time frame, there is nothing to stop a worried parent, a concerned child or anyone else from going to the accrediting organisation if they are concerned about the quality of the care being provided. We would expect the accrediting organisation to have a system in place to deal with complaints and concerns raised by individuals during that two-year framework.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not yet know how many assessors will be involved in the task because we are expanding facilities
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
for out-of-school care. It depends on the extent to which that expansion takes place and the demand for it. One reason for making regulations is that, if they are not sufficiently tight and do not serve the purpose that we all want them to serve, we can amend them as appropriate in the light of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertsmere asked about the number of organisations involved. The issue is complex. Eight organisations have so far expressed an interest in becoming accrediting bodies and we do not expect many more. They are a mixture of voluntary and private sector and local authority providers. A few more may emerge on the scene, but not many.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The number of child care providers who will be accredited under the scheme depends on how fast expansion takes place in the demand for out-of-school child care places and the extent to which those places cater only for the over-eights. If they cater for the under-eights as well as the over-eights, they will be regulated under existing social services and education regulations. It is very difficult at this stage to specify the number of child care providers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hertsmere also asked about the child care tax credit. We do not yet know how many people will take advantage of the Government's generous and important provision, which will for the first time ensure that low-income working families can afford good quality child care. I do not have the figure in front of me, but I recall that following our early advertising campaign on working families tax credit more than 300,000 inquiries have been made to date. We shall have to wait and see how many of those translate into applications and families that are eligible for the child care tax credit and how many more come through word of mouth and other information campaigns to ensure that people know about the system. It also depends on how successful we are in encouraging more people to participate in the labour market and on the expansion of that labour market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Lady tell the Committee her most recent estimate of the cost of the tax credit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I cannot. As I said, we do not know how many early inquiries will turn into legitimate claims and we do not know how many further inquiries there will be as knowledge of the working families tax credit and the associated child care tax credit spreads. I have no doubt that there will be exchanges on this issue. It is not information that we are trying to keep to ourselves. As soon as it becomes real information, we will share it with Members of Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to those who are and are not covered by the measure. The Inland Revenue is looking at how we can extend eligibility for the tax credits to disabled children who are looked after in their homes and we shall be introducing proposals. If a neighbour or a grandparent is registered as a child minder—it is the registration that matters because that ensures the quality of the care—there is nothing to prevent that registered child minder from charging for services. The parent who is at work and requires a child minder will apply for working families tax credit and child care tax credit arising therefrom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Is there anything under the rules to stop two neighbouring parents from registering and then acting as child minders for each other's children? They will be in work—looking after the neighbour's children while the neighbour looks after theirs, so as to benefit from the tax credits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Theoretically, there is nothing to prevent that from occurring. Through our registration regulation inspection regime, which we are working out and which will require legislative time—we hope to do something about it in the near future—we shall look at the checks and balances to ensure that there is proper use of public resources. I think that that is what the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) meant by his question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not specifically on the proper use of taxpayers' money, but more about seeking justification for when I was a social security spokesman more than a year ago—when we raised the matter with the Department of Social Security, the idea was pooh-poohed as inconceivable. Presumably, on the Minister's argument, if an individual is accredited as a child minder, she is fully qualified and competent to child mind, so it will be difficult for the state to interfere and start saying what category of children the child minder can look after. The state would not logically be able to stop neighbours from accrediting themselves and then looking after each other's children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Theoretically not. As the system exists, to qualify for the working families tax credit and the associated child care tax credit, the children must not be cared for in the parents' home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They would walk next door.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but we shall have a system of checks. If the parent of family A says that she is caring all day for the children of family B in her house and the parent of family B says that she child minds the children of family A in her house, checks on whether that is happening will be required to ensure that it is true.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Presumably, if it were happening in the correct way, nothing would be wrong with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our prime interest in ensuring quality care for young children is to register only those child minders who have the appropriate qualifications and qualities to be effective. The theoretical proposition that has been suggested could occur, but it is highly unlikely that it will occur in practice. I hope that the regulatory regime that we are in the process of devising, and on which we shall submit proposals to the House, will ensure that there are sufficient checks and balances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford raised an important subject. Is there anything in the regulations to prevent the scenario to which he referred from arising, provided that all the other criteria are met?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the regulations is to ensure that parents of over-eights, whose children are in settings that care only for the over-eights, are eligible for child care tax credit. I remind Opposition Members that the child care tax credit system pays only 70 per cent. of
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
child care costs. Therefore, if family A were to try to set up such a system with family B, and to take advantage of the child care tax credit system for other purposes—to increase their income—they would still have to meet 30 per cent. of the cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is absolutely right, but if family A must pay for child care costs anyway, it is an attractive option for them if they can legitimately use a system that helps them to recoup 70 per cent. of those costs. I am not saying that it is wrong, but 18 months ago, the Government suggested that anyone who said that that could happen was not talking about reality. Now that the regulations are being introduced, it transpires that it could easily happen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Theoretically, it could happen under the existing regulations for child minders of the under-eights. If one starts thinking through the implications of the scenario that has been painted, in which family A and family B do a deal and both decide to look after each other's children in each other's houses it is quite improbable, but let us assume that it takes place—not only would the parents have to meet 30 per cent. of the child care costs, they would have to pay tax on the income they receive for the so-called work they do. Those strictures will be a constraint on any abuse of the system that could theoretically occur.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Burns</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So that there is no misunderstanding, that situation is not necessarily an abuse within the remit of the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessarily an abuse within the remit of the regulations because that is not the purpose of the regulations. However, we shall look again at the way in which the regulation, registration and inspection of child care providers is set up, to try to ensure that only quality child minders are registered. I hope that, through all the various mechanisms that we shall employ, and by extending the current regulations as we are doing, we will ensure that the regulations are used for their proper purpose—to assist low-income families to pay for high quality and affordable child care.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cotswold)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister about a different matter relating to children at risk. There are two scenarios. First, the child may be at risk from the child minder. Secondly, the child minder may suspect that children are at risk from someone else. What will be the interaction between child minders, social services and the police, and how will the confidentiality of the child be maintained?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The child minders will be regulated. They are currently regulated by social services legislation. They are inspected annually and there are announced and unannounced annual inspections. Their suitability for working with children is also checked. Those provisions will not change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our main consideration has been to ensure that children's safety and the appropriateness of the people who work with them is paramount. There will be no change in that regard. A child may say that he feels at risk, but we shall ensure that everyone who assesses and checks child minders will have the appropriate training and background to deal sensitively with those representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Clappison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister draws her remarks to a conclusion, I have a question for her. Will child care providers be subject to the disqualification from working with children regulations?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Hodge</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. The purpose of introducing the regulations is to ensure that when parents leave children who are over eight in the care of child minders or in other out-of-school settings, they do so with the assurance that appropriate checks have been done and that the safety and well being of their children are assured by the authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion—I know that Committee members want to be elsewhere—the regulations will play an important
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
role in extending eligibility for the child care tax credit element of the WFTC and the DPTC to families with older children who receive good-quality affordable child care. I hope that the Committee will join me in approving them. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
