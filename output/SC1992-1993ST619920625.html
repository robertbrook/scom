	<div class='legislation'>VETERINARY SURGERY (EPIDURAL ANAESTHESIA) ORDER 1992</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Caerphilly)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Veterinary Surgery (Epidural Anaesthesia) Order (S.I., 1992, No. 696.)</p></blockquote>
May I first of all welcome the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Committee. I had a brief opportunity on the Floor of the House to congratulate him on his recent appointment. I am sure that as the years unfold, he will spend many interesting hours in Committee dealing with orders relating to his Ministry. If he continues in the same spirit as he started, he will find that the hours are not too long and can be enjoyable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without delaying our proceedings, I should also like to welcome new Members of Parliament to the Committee. I hope that they will enter into the spirit of our debates. I hope also that they will not be too partisan, but hon. Members should have the opportunity to present their views so that we can have informed and lively debate. I am especially glad that I am joined on this occasion by three of my hon. Friends, all of whom are new Members of Parliament and have a special interest in animal welfare. I hope that we shall be able to raise the profile of animal welfare during this Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we have a Government Whip among us—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert G. Hughes 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I think that I am a Whip.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Ah, but does the Government Chief Whip think that the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Hughes) is a Government Whip? As with policemen, it appears that Government Whips are getting younger every day; but that may be a reflection of my own failed aspirations in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to reassure—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>]—Of course, I am happy to take interventions, but they will delay our proceedings, something that I do not wish to do unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was about to reassure the Government Whip that I have no intention at present of pressing for a Division, but that depends on the Minister. If he is his usual affable, courteous and helpful self, I am sure that we can bring our proceedings to a conclusion without a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to explain why we are praying against the order. It would allow a person who is not a qualified veterinarian to administer an epidural anaesthetic. That operation can be difficult and can cause injury to an animal receiving that anaesthetic. For example, complications can arise if the injection is not made in the right place. It can also lead to paralysis and spinal damage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
We must ensure that adequate safeguards are built into the proper procedures. We should also seriously consider the wider issues involved in the process of embryo transfer. I understand, Mr. Knox, that we are dealing with a very specific order and that it would be inappropriate to have too wide-ranging a debate. However, we must take very seriously the fact that administration of an anaesthetic is being taken out of the hands of veterinarians. It will be cheaper and easier to administer, and that will give a green light to people working in genetic research and its commercial application. It will therefore lead to an increase in embryo transfers as well as epidural anaesthetics administered by non-veterinarians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Embryo transfer, as it is currently conducted, has two purposes. It is an essential part of genetic research, which no Labour Member wants to inhibit because it will allow scientists to improve the genetic material of livestock, and it might also improve the health and welfare of animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, embryo transfer is not only carried out for the benefit of animals; it also has commercial applications. It could improve the quality of breeds by allowing animals of lower quality to give birth to animals of higher quality. That can involve either greater milk production for dairy cattle, or a greater rate of growth or better confirmation for beef cattle. We should be aware of those problems. If we give a green light to the industry to develop new techniques by loosening controls we should ensure that animals are properly safeguarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not alone in my anxieties about that matter. Francis Anthony, who is vice-president of the British Veterinary Association, asked of embryo transfer and the administration of anaesthesia:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Why is it that we subject an animal to a procedure in order to make it breed how we want it to breed rather than in the way it is naturally capable of breeding"?</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The issue of embryo transfer has not been properly debated by Parliament and the technology appears to be outpacing effective legislative control."</p></blockquote>
A couple of years ago, 
	<i>The Veterinary Record,</i> which is the journal of the BVA, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To a large extent the pace of the debate on embryo transfer is being set by developments in the technology and pressure for its commercial application. If the veterinary profession does not make a stand on the welfare aspects who will"?</p></blockquote>
The veterinary profession has made its anxieties known.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are considerable welfare problems. The process of embryo transfer means that donors of eggs or embryos will be subject to hormone treatment to make them superovulate. That would allow 10, 15 or 20 eggs or fertilised embryos to be collected from an animal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recipient—the animal into which the fertilised embryo is implanted—is often inappropriate. That happens most strikingly when a low-quality cross-bred cow is implanted with the fertilised embryo of a beef breed, which is much heavier. To be anthropomorphic for a moment, the Minister could represent the beef breed and my hon. Friend the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) a slim-line version of the human breed. Clearly, there is a great genetic difference between the two. It would be quite inappropriate if the forebears of my hon. Friend were forcibly implanted with genetic material from the Minister and I am not sure whether the genetic make-up of the people of Nuneaton would be improved. My point is that an unnecessary stress is put on the animal that receives the fertilised embryo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
There has been a substantial increase in the use of Caesarean sections, which lead to multiple births, which are otherwise rare in cattle. The animal's body is violated to withdraw and to implant embryos. The animal is subject to anaesthesia during that process, which shows that it is a difficult and painful procedure. Animals are not treated in those ways for their benefit. There is no health or welfare benefit to the animal; the procedures are solely for human profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing wrong with that, and we do not wish to stand in the way of progress if there is genuine benefit to the economy, but we have to decide whether the animal's suffering is justified by the economic benefit. Given that both products of the British herd—milk and beef—are in surplus, we must ask ourselves whether we want widespread commercial application of the process and where that would lead us. I believe that it would lead to increasing surpluses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point was recognised by Francis Anthony, who said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our members are seeing an increasing number of bad calvings and are having to carry out more caesarians. It is a real welfare problem and we are having to pick up the bits."</p></blockquote>
We should note that important last point, and the implications as stated by the veterinary profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister arrange an opportunity in Parliament—not necessarily immediately or in pursuance of the order—for a proper debate on the whole question of the use of this technology, and especially the practice of embryo transfer among cattle? Will he also ensure that a proper code of practice is laid down? The current rules are 10 years old; they need to be updated, and clear and specific. As well as having a debate for our own sakes, we must give clear guidelines to the public, the practitioners and the researchers on how we should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The preamble to the order refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"consultation in accordance with the said section … with the Council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons".</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister tell us about the progress of those consultations? I understand that the royal college had doubts about whether the order should be laid before Parliament. We know that the British Veterinary Association is worried about it. All hon. Members will have received briefings from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Compassion in World Farming, a highly respected organisation which has also sent us briefings, has made known its concern, and there is a dispute among members of the royal college.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The college gave an equivocal briefing to at least two Members of Parliament who are members of the council of the college, stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Epidural anaesthesia is an invasion of a body cavity and should therefore be regarded as an act of veterinary surgery that can only be carried out by a veterinary surgeon on the Register of the RCVS."</p></blockquote>
The Minister was obliged to consult the college. Were its views put to his Ministry, and if so, will he explain how he reconciles with those views his failure to accept the advice, not of the RSPCA or welfare groups, but of the members of the college whom he is required by statute to consult? This is most important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<i>The Veterinary Record</i> of 17 November 1990 mentioned the position of the royal college. Its leader article quotes the views of the college as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"On the specific question of the administration of epidurals, the working party recommended that the preferred option was for epidural anaesthesia to be administered by a veterinary surgeon".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
That is a clear and unequivocal statement of the views of the working party. I must ask the Minister to reconcile the conflict between that view and his failure to accept advice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to explore the matter for two reasons: first, because of the welfare problem and the need to ensure that a properly qualified veterinarian is present to make the necessary assessment of the welfare implications and, secondly, because if something goes wrong or the anaesthesia is administered incorrectly, it may lead to collapse of the animal or paralysis. If a qualified veterinary surgeon is not present, how can we ensure that the animal will receive proper veterinary care? I must press the Minister on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that the Government have taken account of that because the order states in paragraph 3(4)(b) that an unqualified person, if he has been trained, can administer the anaesthetic
	<br><blockquote><p>"under the authority of a team veterinarian".</p></blockquote>
That is a major loophole. What does "under the authority" mean? If I were a team veterinarian, could I say to a colleague, "Yes, that is a suitable donor, you have the stuff, you have been trained, so off you go and do it"? Does the phrase mean that I must be present on the same premises or available at the end of a telephone? Does it mean that I must be available at all or even in the country? Will the Minister clarify the meaning of "under the authority"? Does it mean under the direct supervision or can the authority be passed by verbal authorisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those anxieties are felt by those of us who have the highest concern for animal welfare and by the veterinary profession, and also by the practitioners, those involved in the research and the commercial application of that research. It could be argued that they have a vested interest and I accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall quote from a letter in 
	<i>The Veterinary Record</i> of 28 March 1992 from a representative of Coulthard Genetics, which is involved in research. The right hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Alison) is not here, but a couple of Yorkshire Members are present and may be interested to know that the representative is from Selby in north Yorkshire. He is a veterinarian and stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Administration of epidural anaesthesia, flushing of the uterus and implantation of embryos all involve entering a body cavity which is, and should remain, the sole province of the veterinary surgeon. Many of the techniques involved are not only acts of veterinary surgery, but require specialised training and much practice.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Damage can be, and is, caused to the animal if careful manipulation and aseptic techniques are not adopted. Having been involved in the training of intelligent veterinary surgeons and lay personnel, I have seen first hand the problems which can occur through lack of proper training. I have also seen, in other countries especially, the disregard for animal welfare which can occur in these procedures and the poor results obtained where operators have not had the essential veterinary training, experience or a correct code of practice with regard to animal welfare."</p></blockquote>
He continued:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In my opinion, a veterinary surgeon well trained in the various techniques, ie, the team leader, needs to be present, not just responsible, when any of these activities are being undertaken.</p></blockquote>
There it is. I have presented to the Minister what I believe is a wide case. Genetic manipulation is a major development of bio-engineering and biotechnology. We do not wish to stand in the way of that development because there may be necessary benefits, but we must ensure that the welfare of animals who are subject to the procedures are safeguarded.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
I have described anxieties and a range of opinion from responsible welfare organisations, the veterinary profession and practitioners in the field, as well as of Members of Parliament—we all receive representations from people who are concerned about animal welfare. I have made a general case and asked a couple of specific questions. I hope that the Minister will assure the Committee that we shall not today loosen requirements that may lead to widespread abuse of animals which we use for our own purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am a Privy Council appointee to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to which the hon. Member for Caerphilly referred. As such, I sit on the parliamentary committee and on the full council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. I want to underline the hon. Gentleman's point when he said that the veterinary profession is very worried about many of the implications of the practice of embryo transfer and its implications for animal welfare and the veterinary profession if there is a serious growth in that practice.

My purpose for being here today is to set out as tersely as I can the position of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. It is correct to say that there has been much agonising and debate in the parliamentary committee and in the full council. The issue has caused much heart-searching to find the right balance and the right position for the college.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caerphilly was correct when he stated that the fundamental position of the RCVS is that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Epidural anaesthesia is an invasion of a body cavity and should therefore be regarded as an act of veterinary surgery that can only be carried out by a veterinary surgeon on the Register of the RCVS. Epidural anaesthesia for embryo transfer in cattle was just one of the welfare and legal issues examined by the RCVS working party under the chairmanship of the senior vice-president Dr. J. N. Lucke. The Council of the RCVS has accepted that donor and recipient cows should have the benefit of epidural anaesthesia to control pain and facilitate the collection and transfer of embryos.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>There are members of the profession who believe that epidural anaesthesia should only be performed by veterinary surgeons and their arguments have been taken into account. After considerable debate, however, Council has agreed that, with formal training and certification of competence, it would be acceptable for technicians, as members of an embryo transfer team, to carry out caudal epidural anaesthesia in cattle specifically for this purpose provided that there were adequate supervisory controls by a veterinary surgeon who would either be the embryo transfer team leader or another veterinary surgeon acting on his or her behalf."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was precisely what I meant by the apparent contradictions in the advice of the RCVS. The hon. Gentleman has given us two quotes. The first was clear, and I quote from the same brief that he used:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Epidural anaesthesia is an invasion of a body cavity and should therefore be regarded as an act"—</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
da-de-da—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that can only be carried out by a veterinary surgeon."</p></blockquote>
How does the hon. Gentleman reconcile that with his subsequent point that it is acceptable for technicians to do that? That contradiction must be reconciled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I do not know what "da-de-da" means, but it is certainly not English. Committees should be conducted in English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, Mr. Knox, I represent a Welsh constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not permit the hon. Gentleman to speak in Welsh.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Colin Shepherd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct to emphasise that point. What the RCVS recognised in its debate was that the absolute position was not necessarily sustainable. Therefore it was agreeable to the concept and, I quote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After considerable debate, however, Council has agreed that, with formal training and certification of competence, it would be acceptable for technicians as members of an embryo transfer team, to carry out caudal epidural anaesthesia in cattle specifically for this purpose provided that there were adequate supervisory controls by a veterinary surgeon who would either be the embryo transfer team leader or another veterinary surgeon acting on his or her behalf."</p></blockquote>
The bottom line is that at the end of the day the veterinary surgeon would take the responsibility and carry the can. The quote continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is for the RCVS to provide written guidance to members of the profession which will ensure real, not nominal, veterinary controls and safeguard the welfare of animals involved in embryo transfer."</p></blockquote>
That is a sensible position to take.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister will want to respond to the specific points made by the hon. Member for Caerphilly about how consultations were carried on and what the consequence of these were. My purpose in being here today is to try to set out the small point mentioned by the hon. Gentleman. It is an absolute, pragmatic and important point that is facing the profession. It is important because it is not impossible to envisage the consequential veterinary disciplinary proceedings flowing from the practice of embryo transfer. That has worried the RCVS deeply. To take an absolute position was felt to be inappropriate, so the compromise was worked out in council and agreed after full debate. That is the position of the RCVS.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
What concerns me, from the documents that I have received, is that, on many occasions, it is said that this is a skiliful procedure that should be carried out by highly skilled personnel. However, I am not certain whether a non-veterinary person could have that skill even if a

If the worst comes to the worst, the measure is accepted and non-veterinary personnel can carry out such work, will the Minister tell me what monitoring there will be to protect animal welfare? In my experience, when rules are set down, everyone is keen at the start to see that everything is done properly, but then things tend to slip a little, and that will do nothing for animal welfare.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel no great anger about embryo transfers but, reading through this order, if we do not get it right now we are giving a green light by setting a precedent for genetic engineering and embryo transfers in other animals. We should not lose sight of that possibility today. Will the Minister give me an assurance that if the measure is passed and other similar matters come before the House, the same procedure will not be enshrined in law or altered to include this practice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask my hon. Friend the Minister a number of questions because it is important that there should be clarification on one or two fronts. I represent a farming constituency in Norfolk which is primarily arable. On a number of occasions, the Minister has been spotted rambling in my constituency, sometimes armed and sometimes unarmed. He is aware that farmers in Norfolk have diversified into beef and that there are quite a few mixed farms. Therefore, far from being purely an arable constituency, there are also now dairy herds and beef herds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the order animal welfare driven or predominantly driven by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons? I want to know a little more about the background of the order. How many of these anaesthetics occur every year? How widespread is the practice of embryo transfer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) who argued that unless genetic engineering is tightly controlled, it could be extended to other types of animal. I am especially worried about pigs and horses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fabric and structure of horsebreeding is very tightly controlled. I fear that embryo transfer techniques could be applied to thoroughbreds with potentially alarming consequences. The embryo of a well-known sire with a stud fee of thousands of pounds could be transferred to a brood mare of low quality or one that was perhaps not a thoroughbred at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some relevant information. At present, 14,000 cattle embryos are implanted each year—approximately 0·4 per cent. of the 3·5 million cattle produced each year. Such work has also been applied to other animals. Some 2,000 to 3,000 sheep embryos are implanted each year—approximately 0·01 to 0·015 per cent. of the total. Embryo implants have also been applied to goats and considerable interest has been expressed in equine embryo implantation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for answering my question, thus doing my hon. Friend the Minister's work for him. However, could my hon. Friend the Minister provide us with more information about the wider background and explain where genetic engineering will lead us?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Not long ago, I read an article in a farming periodical which mentioned a number of young thrusting scientists operating on the fringe of the veterinary community. These are the scientists who want to push genetic engineering furthjer forward, beyond its currently envisaged frontiers. I find it unnatural and rather frightening. Experimentation for the sake of experimentation is highly undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Learning more about prevention of animal suffering in the process of birth or about the many diseases to which animals are susceptible is different. I welcome that, but can there be a guarantee that those will remain the main purpose?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Minister knows that I have well over 3,500 farmers in my constituency, all of who are coming to hear him on 24 October. However, I wish to ask my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West a question. Is he using the term "genetic engineering" correctly? The paperwork produced by animal welfare pressure groups talks about genetic engineering; but I wonder whether the order is related to genetic engineering in the same way. I suspect that it is not, and that scaremongering is preventing the order from being considered as simply and easily as it should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend for her helpful contribution. She obviously knows more about the subject than I do. It is possible that I should use the term "embryo transfer technology" where the term "genetic engineering" has indeed been used in some of the briefing material. I am certainly worried about qualified people working at the fringes of this research, for they might well include some young scientists who will push the project further than currently envisaged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to clarify the valid point made in response to the hon. Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson). Embryo extraction and subsequent transplant is an integral part of the process of genetic engineering. Unless the fertilised embryo is extracted and kept in vitro, the research cannot be done. The addition or subtraction of genetic matgerial from the embryo in vitro before it is subsequently implanted—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Teresa Gorman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Billericay)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is absolutely necessary for research into bovine spongiform encephalopathy, for example. I would be happy to explore that argument, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to recognise that that form of genetic engineering is necessary, valuable and can improve our understanding of the genetic make-up of our livestock. I hope that he will defend his position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bellingham</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do want to see embyos being transferred from a cow into a bullock or other types of animals. These are not just scare stories: my examples have appeared in the farming press.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise a technical, procedural question. We are approving an order today. Can extra regulations be laid down subsequently? I am not a great expert on procedure, but I should like to see further regulations set down by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food either now or in the future. We need such regulations to ensure that recipient animals are always suitable and in good condition when the transfer takes place. We should also ensure that animals are properly looked after during pregnancy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0803">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
We all know that there are some excellent farmers in this country, but there are rotten eggs in every basket and undoubtedly some farmers do not take sufficient care of their animals. If embryo transfer technology is to be extended and more animals are going to be turned into surrogate cows, we must be satisfied that they will be well looked after and cared for. Will the Minister confirm that further regulations can be made in future?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the order driven by animal welfare considerations? If so, I will be more sympathetic. The ability of non-vets to administer epidural anaesthetics should help to prevent animals from suffering. We all know that breeds such as Charolais and Simmental invariably throw large calves. On farms in my constituency, I have seen how important it is to have a vet constantly in attendance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second page of the order deals with the people who administer epidural anaesthesia and the qualifications that they should possess. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to ensure that those qualifications are rigidly adhered to. We must not have farmers administering epidural anaesthesia. Cowmen, even those who do courses at a veterinary college, may not qualify to carry out the process. However,as the hon. Member for Nuneaton said, qualifications are often relaxed. So I must ask my hon. Friend the Minister to clarify the criteria in paragraph 3 and explain how they will be applied, monitored, assessed and followed up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.8 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Heppell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to carry on from what the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Bellingham) has just said. He asked what was driving the order and the answer appears to be commercial considerations rather than animal welfare. I do not want to get tied up with arguments about genetic engineering. My reservations go deeper into the underlying reasons for the embryo transplant itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we approve the order, many existing practices seem to go against current lelgislation. Protection of animals legislation between 1911 and 1964 sought effectively to prohibit the causing of unnecessary suffering to an animal by doing or omitting to do any act and performing any operation without due care and humanity. Moreover, the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 provided that it was an offence to cause unnecessary pain or unnecessary suffering to livestock kept on agricultural land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one would disagree that embryo transplants cause pain and suffering to an animal, be it a donor cow which has to endure hormone injections or the recipient cow being given the implant when the cervix is closed—unlike in artificial insemination. Animals suffer from those treatments. Receiving epidural anaesthesia can itself often be painful and we have to decide what is necessary and what is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a vegetarian. I do not support some of the more extreme views of animal welfare groups and I enjoy my roast beef. But I should not feel happy, nor I imagine would others, to think that I was eating roast beef from an animal that had been treated inhumanely to provide it. There is no need for a wider debate now, but I hope that the Minister will reassure us about an opportunity for such a debate in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I seek further reassurance in the light of the point raised by the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West. It has been suggested that the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons issue guidelines. I should have thought that it was the responsibility of the House to issue regulations to ensure that if the practice of epidural anaesthesia continues, it does so in a proper and controlled manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.11 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Gorman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to comment in my capacity as a biologist talking about the cloning of animals. Genetic engineering is tinkering with genes in a testing dish—with a cell, in vitro—and changing it in some way and then passing it back. We are not talking about genetic engineering. There is potential danger in putting potentially large foetuses into rather small animals. As one of the two women who are members of the Committee, I can assure hon. Members that it is very painful to produce a very large baby, and it can be dangerous. The analogy drawn between, my hon. Friend the Minister and the hon. Member for Nuneaton—although I could not work out who was to give birth to whom—could usefully illustrate that point. It should be taken into account in treating animals which will be the recipients of donated embryos because of the future size of animal that the foetus will eventually become.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last by by no means least, there is the question of hormones. To produce the necessary ovulation, the donor cow could be given massive injections of hormones. Those do not just disappear. Hormones leave the animals through excrection in their urine. I remind the Committee that I am the world's expert on hormone treatment. The hormones can later be transferred to humans who handle the animals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known in the equine world that creams containing hormones which were once used on the fetlocks of damaged horses have been absorbed into the skin of the young stable girls who administrated them, causing extra doses of hormones to enter their systems. If they had been middle-aged, that might have been an advantage for them because it was the equivalent of hormone replacement therapy. However, it was dangerous for the young stable maids. We should bear in mind that we are tinkering about with something that is potentially dangerous. People who handle these animals and come into contact with their excreta could be at risk from those extra hormones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I appreciate his help and advice. This has been a well-informed and lively debate on an important subject and I shall do my best to answer the points that were raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the order is to put in place arrangements for the use of epidural anaesthesia during embryo collection or transfer. I shall try to answer the general and the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Caerphilly. To help hon. Members to understand the reasons for the order, I will give the Committee some background on the development and techniques of embryo transfer. However, I should make it plain that we are not here today to debate the ethics of embryo transfer. This is a far wider issue which the House will have the opportunity to consider, if it wishes, when regulations governing embryo transfer are laid before it later this year. I am sure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0804">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
that the hon. Member for Caerphilly will be able to use all the facilities of the Standing Orders procedure to ensure that those matters are properly discussed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ron Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but may I press him a little further? Will he use his best endeavours to ensure that the debate takes place on the Floor of the House, with adequate time, rather then in Committee? The issues are so wide that many hon. Members would want to be involved, and they would participate if the debate was held on the Floor of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am anxious to make my way in the parliamentary world, it would be unwise of me to give such an undertaking. However, the hon. Gentleman and I could discuss this and decide about the best way to have a debate if he wishes there to be one. Regulations will be laid and there will be an opportunity for the hon. Gentleman to pray against them. If he wishes the debate to be on the Floor of the House That is a matter for the usual channels, but he and I can discuss it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is primarily concerned with the ethics of allowing lay persons to perform epidural anaesthesia during embryo transfer, a task hitherto restricted to veterinary surgeons. May I say to my hon. Friends the Members for Norfolk, North-West and for Billericay (Mrs. Gorman) and to the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell) that the need for the order to be enshrined in legislation is related entirely to animal welfare and has no connection with commercial interests. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Shepherd) who, as a Privy Council nominee to the council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons has come here to explain the royal college's view. It is of concern to every decent person in the land that animals should not be hurt in any way during these operations. That is why the order has been laid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members may be aware, the practice of embryo transfer is an important and developing tool in the field of artificial breeding. The benefits anticipated include a more rapid genetic improvement in desirable traits in animals, the better control of disease and the conservation of less common genes. At this stage of development, embryo transfer is mainly used in pedigree cattle herds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West, who set out clearly his anxieties about the matter, that the order does not cover sheep, goats or equine transfers. Those are currently carried out by surgical procedures which can be performed only by veterinary surgeons. My hon. Friend asked about the further development of the genetic manipulation of embryos and that is an important matter to which we shall return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of experimental work in genetic manipulation continues to be carried out under scientific procedures licences. That work is being monitored closely by my Ministry as well as by the European Commission and the international office for Epizootic diseases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) was right to refer to scare stories that get out of control. This is a highly important scientific matter to which the hon. Member for Nottingham, East rightly said the House may wish to return at another time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Embryo transfer in cattle in the United Kingdom is guided at present by a voluntary code of practice which the Government produced in 1980. However, following the introduction of European Communtiy legislation
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
governing the collection of embryos destined for trade within the Community, both the veterinary profession and the industry have supported the need to regulate the whole area of embryo transfer within the United Kingdom. The European Council directive will be implemented through legislation implementing a number of trade directives. However, legislation is being prepared to govern the collection of embryos for the domestic market and their transfer into recipients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Nottingham, East helpfully gave the Committee some figures. The Government's figures are slightly lower; we estimate that there are approximately 10,000 embryo transfers and 5,000 collections. Embryo transfer involves collecting embryos by flushing them from a live donor cow—the embryos being the result of fertilisation following artificial insemination or natural service—and transferring them to recipient cows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not for me to quarrel with my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay on matters about which I know little. She is a biologist and I take note of her comments. If anything flows from the debate, I shall write to her.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Emma Nicholson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister confirm that the order does not cover cloning or genetic engineering? My hon. Friend the Member for Billericay, who is well qualified in the subject, had a tiny misunderstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Soames</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The order covers nothing more or less than epidural anaesthesia. We shall be able to return to those matters if the hon. Member for Caerphilly secures the debate that he wants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In preparing the regulations, it became apparent that the welfare implications of the procedures could be significant if animals started to strain and became restless while the manipulations were being carried out. Animals vary greatly in their reaction to the manipulations involved and it is just not possible to predict the degree of reaction or which animals may be affected. Once the procedure has begun it is too late to remedy the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That difficulty can be overcome by using epidural anaesthetic. This is done by injecting an anaesthetic solution into the epidural cavity at the base of the animal's spine at a point much lower on the spine than is used in human epidurals. The veterinary advice on this matter is clear: the risk of causing unnecessary pain and suffering in the course of embryo collection or transfer is high enough to justify making epidural anaesthesia mandatory in all cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that will set at rest the minds of all members of the Committee who raised the matter of animal welfare. The requirement is driven entirely by consideration for animal welfare. The requirement does not represent an additional burden on businesses or a change in practices: epidural anaesthesia is already commonly used by veterinarians engaged in embryo transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Community legislation allows technicians working under the responsibility of a veterinary surgeon to collect embryos and it is logical to permit the same person to carry out the entire procedure, including administration of the epidural prior to the collection. However, under the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966, epidural anaesthesia, as the hon. Member for Caerphilly rightly said, was classed as an act of veterinary surgery which could be performed only by a veterinary surgeon. The Government took the advice of the veterinary profession and the industry as to whether lay persons could or should be suitably trained to perform
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0805">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
epidural anaesthesia. It was the view of the council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons—and I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford for setting that out so clearly—that suitably trained and competent lay persons should be allowed to perform epidural anaesthesia. The council voted in favour of the order—no member of the council voted against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government therefore concluded, having consulted extensively, that the best solution, in order to implement the directive and at the same time ensure that the welfare of donor and recipient animals was protected, was to make an order under section 19(4) of the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 allowing trained lay persons to perform epidural anaesthesia in the course of embryo transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members should be aware that Parliament has entrusted the enforcement of ethical aspects of the Veterinary Surgeons Act 1966 to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. The question of whether lay persons should be allowed to perform a task hitherto reserved to veterinary surgeons is basically a matter of ethics, and the decision properly belonged with the royal college. I understand that some members of the veterinary profession believe that epidural anaesthesia should be performed only by a veterinary surgeon. The royal college took account of those views, but—I stress this point again—came to the conclusion that with proper training and veterinary control, it was acceptable to allow lay persons to perform epidural anaesthesia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I presume that objections to that arrangement are on the grounds of animal welfare. I assure the committee that the order contains specific safeguards to ensure that the welfare of the animals is not prejudiced. Lay persons must follow an approved course in the theory and technique of epidural anaesthesia at a university veterinary school. The hon. Member for Nuneaton raised an important point about training and skills in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Cambridge university veterinary school has agreed to organise a suitable course, which will be scrutinised by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons and my Department. The hon. Member for Caerphilly and my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North-West asked about a code of practice. The royal college and the British Veterinary Association will draw up a code of practice in support of the embryo transfer regulations. If we have a further debate, those matters can be more fully discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important safeguard included in the order is that lay persons administering epidural anaesthesia will be under veterinary control. The hon. Member for Caerphilly referred to that. They will be required to work within an approved embryo collection or transfer team, on the instructions and under the authority of the veterinarian responsible for the team. "Under the authority" is a key
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
phrase and I understand the hon. Gentleman's anxiety about its meaning. The team veterinarian will be bound by the rules of the guide to professional conduct issued by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. The guide specifies clearly the responsibilities of veterinary surgeons and we have no reason to believe that it is not satisfactory, although in drawing up the codes we shall ensure that they are enshrined in the proper canons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lay persons will be able to summon veterinary help in the case of an emergency and if the team veterinarian is not to be present when the epidural is given, he must have made prior arrangements with another veterinary surgeon to ensure that veterinary assistance is available without delay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened carefully to the well-informed and coherent arguments of hon. Members, but remain satisfied that suitably trained technicians, working within an approved embryo transfer team and under the instructions and authority of a veterinary surgeon, should be allowed to perform epidural anaesthesia in the course of embryo transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point at issue remains whether lay persons can be suitably trained to perform epidural anaesthesia or whether the technique is complicated enough or presents such risks to the animal that it should be restricted to veterinary surgeons. The council of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons has made the professional judgement that lay persons can be suitably trained. The members of the council were unanimous in that view and I see no reason to challenge it. In making their decision they specified the safeguards regarding training and veterinary control which must be included in the order. I am also satisfied that those safeguards will ensure that the welfare of animals is not prejudiced by allowing lay persons to perform epidural anaesthesia in the course of embryo transfer.
