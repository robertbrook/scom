	<div class='member'>Mr. Bryan Gould 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Dagenham) </div> <!-- memberconstituency --> </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 238, in page 20, leave out lines 12 to 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Welcome back, Sir Michael. We look forward to a long and profitable afternoon and evening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment is meant to probe a slight mystery in subsection (5). If the subsection were omitted, as the amendment proposes, it would leave local authorities to calculate the tax rate for bands of property only where property of that band occured within the authority's area. For example, if there were no properties for band H in a certain local authority area, that authority would not have to calculate a tax for properties in that band.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not understand why subsection (5) is in the Bill and we should like the Minister to explain its purpose. It states that an authority should assume for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) that one or more dwellings in each property band falls within its area and any part of its area that requires a separate bill to be set. However, there is a slight contradiction with subsection (1) which requires the authority to calculate only
	<br><blockquote><p>"for each category of dwellings in its area"</p></blockquote>
the amount of council tax to be set. The only purpose of subsection (5) seems to be to ensure that the local authority calculates a tax rate for all bands, even though all bands do not exist in the area. We are puzzled why that should be so. Why should a local authority have to calculate a tax on the purely hypothetical basis that some properties that manifestly do not exist within its area really do exist and therefore attract a rate of tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"each category of dwellings in its area"</p></blockquote>
in subsection (1) is a reference to each valuation band, although I am not sure that that is necessarily the case. Can the Minister confirm that that is so?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why has this been done? The only answer that I can offer is that it is for purely propaganda and presentational purposes. It is meant to signify to council tax payers in a given local authority area that there is a wider range of liability than there is. For example, if there were only three bands in a local authority area, a person might be diverted if he were told that a range of tax liability had been established for all eight bands even though tax was raised on three bands only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that it is necessary to calculate the tax in case properties move into bands that are not currently represented, but as he has adamantly said throughout our proceedings that once a property is allocated to a band it will remain there in perpetuity, that
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
hardly seems a convincing answer. I am therefore forced to conclude that subsection (5) is purely for propaganda purposes. It is meant to mislead and to pretend that the tax is fairer in that it covers a wider range than it does; and it is meant to conceal the very real problems that arise from compressing properties into a few bands. In other words, it is meant to conceal that in some parts of the country the new council tax will, to all intents and purposes, be virtually a flat-rate tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Stamford and Spalding)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be reasonable to make provisions in case a property or several properties are subsequently built that fit into that new band?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould:</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> Perhaps that will be the Minister's answer, but it will not be a convincing one, especially when the properties fall within two or three bands and there are none in the top one. The Minister might say that it is best to prepare for all eventualities, but, as this is an annual calculation, that hardly seems a sensible precaution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like my hon. Friend to consider further the intervention by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). Last Thursday, I asked the Minister about new properties. We were told that the value would be as at 1 April 1990. Therefore, either the hon. Gentleman has got it wrong or we have been misinformed by the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be interesting to hear the Minister's response to that point. My constituency is by no means the most extreme example. It is just about conceivable that a millionaire might move there and build a house worth half a million pounds, but it is unlikely. The prospect of a property in my constituency falling into the top band is remote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic point remains: the exercise is designed to promote the idea of a wide range of liability rather than to deal with practical circumstances'. As the amendment is merely probing, will the Minister tell us the purpose of subsection (5)?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Maria Fyfe 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Maryhill)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), I was puzzled when I came to this part of the Bill. If there were no houses in a particular band, presumably to get the amount required the council would have to calculate the income needed from the council tax and then bill each householder. If, for example, there were no houses in band H, and band H is supposed to pay three times what band A pays, it would follow that the houses in bands A to G would have to pay even more to bring in the income that the authority requires to compensate for there being no houses in band H. If that is not the case, the Minister must explain clearly what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that nowhere in the country will there be bands in which there are no houses, but I can think of areas in which there will be extremely few houses in bands A and H. The burden that falls on the houses in the other bands will, therefore, be all the greater. That will mean that every year, a local authority will have to calculate what householders in a particular band would pay—if there were any—so that calculations are correct for households in the existing bands. I do not understand how it will be possible to avoid those complicated calculations year upon year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Local Government and Inner Cities (Mr. Michael Portillo) </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not complicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0415">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They may not seem complicated to the Minister, in which case he should be away teaching maths somewhere instead of wasting his time here. Most of us find this quite a business. There will be varying, not equal, numbers of houses in each band. Calculation will not be easy and the Minister is in for some rude noises from the local authorities if he expects the system to be operated without problems. They will tell him that the task is more complicated than he seems to believe. I await his answer eagerly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not dwelt long on the amendment, and that is right as I do not think that much is at issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put the mind of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) at rest, I can assure her that the amendment has nothing to do with the calculation of the tax base. That means that it has nothing to do with working out how much money will be raised by the local authority in council tax. There is no need to make false assumptions about properties that do not exist as though they could contribute to the amount that could be raised. The amount of grant or non-domestic rate that authorities will receive will not be affected. The amendment would simply ask authorities to set out all the tax rates for each band of property as they would apply if those properties existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not complicated, as the hon. Lady said it was. In any authority, the band H charge is three times the band A charge, and the band G charge is two and a half times the band A charge. That is not complicated. The calculations can be done in the head and do not even call for a calculator, as, at their most difficult, they only require a knowledge of the three times table.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no question of a burden being placed on a local authority. I do not believe that this is an onerous consideration. My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) was right to say that during the course of a year a property may be built or there may be a change of ownership of a property that has been altered, with the result that it may belong to a band that is different from the one to which it was allocated originally. It seems right, for the sake of neatness and to increase the availability of the public information that will facilitate comparability across the country, that every local authority should lay out what the tax rates would be for each band.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to complete this point, as it might help the hon. Gentleman, who asked about the expression "category of dwellings" in subsection (1). That expression is used because the matter is slightly complicated by the fact that, where an area is parished, the council tax that will apply in each parish will vary slightly. Therefore, it is also right that the local authority should lay out what the full range of tax rates across the bands would be in each area, taking into account the parochial differences. That is what "category of dwellings" in subsection (1) is intended to catch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that we do not need to linger on this matter, but I am interested in the Minister's explanation of the meaning of "category". I take it that not only is its relation to valuation bands not exclusive, but that it does
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
not relate to them at all. Will the Minister confirm that it relates to the separate notion of categories, along the lines that he has just described?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying that a "category of dwellings" describes all the dwellings in a valuation band in a part of the billing authority's area—for example, a parish—in which a set of taxes applies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I So it relates to valuation bands, but with the additional complication of the parish precept. I understand that, but will the Minister confirm that, potentially, we are talking about notional properties—properties that do not exist—when the calculation postulated in clause 32 is undertaken? The Minister is right to say that there would be no effect on the tax base or on the calculation of the council tax because no property exists to attract a bill of the sort that has been described. Therefore, in reality the simple calculation required by subsection (5) will be made for illustrative purposes only. I agree that it is conceivable that later in the same financial year a property will emerge that, uniquely belongs to a band not represented in the area beforehand. However, although I understand the Minister to be saying that the calculation is to be done simply for illustrative purposes and for the sake of neatness and completeness, I retain my suspicion that it is partly in the Government's mind that it should be there to suggest a wider range of liability than will in fact be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know to what extent the Government's mind is different from mine, but in my mind no such consideration arose. There might be a practical difficulty. If a new house were in band G, but the local authority had not set a tax for that band because there was no dwellings in that category, there might be quite a nice legal point about whether a tax could be levied on that property. The owner of the property might be able to challenge the local authority's right to impose a tax because it had not previously laid down a figure. As reasonable men and women we could all say that it follows, just as night follows day, that the band G rate is two and a half times the band A rate, but if the local authority had not specified that, appeals could ensue. I do not want a reasonably well-off person in a band G property to escape the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister is so sensitive to such an issue. However, if that were the real reason, a provision different from subsection (5) could have been drafted to the effect that the liability to tax for a property emerging in a band not hitherto represented would be calculated according to the specified principles. There is no need to calculate and publish a range of tax rates, some of which are simply hypothetical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we believe that whatever is in the Minister's mind, it might be in minds even more machiavellian than his that there is an advantage in publishing the full range of taxes in local newspapers. People could then say, "We are a long way down so we do not feel so bad about it. Look at all those people way above us who are going to pay so much more." The reality is that there will be no one above them who will be paying the top rate. I do not suppose that we can persuade the Minister to take remedial action, but we are justified in harbouring that residual suspicion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish first to challenge the hon. Gentleman's theory that there is in the Government a mind more machiavellian than mine. That charge cannot be sustained. What the hon. Gentleman says about triggering a process when a new house is built so that the local authority has to refer to the law or to pass a special motion to bring into tax that new house is a recipe for more administrative difficulty than is necessary. We are proposing that all the tax rates should be set out for all properties, so if a property is built the owner knows what the tax rate will be and there will be no doubt about the liability to tax. On reflection, the hon. Gentleman must agree that that is a more sensible system. I am sure that the Association of London Authorities, to take an association at random, will believe that the administrative simplicity of our proposal is sensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reject the charge that I or local government accountants cannot multiply by two and a half or three. I was not referring to that difficulty. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) is right to say that if people are misled into thinking that a certain band exists when it does not, they will be paying in the happy conviction that other people, who do not exist, are paying their fair share. If band H does not exist, everyone in bands A to G will be paying more than he or she would if band H did exist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: People must be. I accept the Minister's point that this has nothing to do with the actual tax base because the aggregate brought in from the entire area must be the same, but if certain bands simply do not exist, it follows that everyone else will have to pay more—more personally, not more in aggregate. If that does not follow, the Minister must explain why not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, Sir Michael. I want to make the matter absolutely clear. If the calculation is purely for administrative neatness, and to show what everyone would pay if all bands existed, what is the objection to an amendment which would mean that when bills were sent out it would be made clear in a public advertisement which bands existed and which did not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to put local authorities to the expense of placing a public advertisement. I am happy with the drafting of the Bill, which meets the point nicely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It makes no difference to the amount of tax that people pay in a given area that some people are in band G or in band H. Whatever the tax base of the local authority, however small and even if it consists entirely of band A dwellings, the Government would pay on top of that national non-domestic rates, which is a standard amount per head, and the amount of revenue support grant that was needed to bridge the gap between the sum of the tax base and the national non-domestic rates and the need to spend, which is the standard spending assessment. If the tax base is lower, the amount of grant is higher. It makes no difference if some people within the area are in the higher bands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the Government give the grants to correct disparities between authorities purely on an arithmetical basis with no political considerations? Is it a genuine arithmetical calculation
	<span class='label label-info column'>716</span>
without any prejudice in favour of Tory boroughs and against Labour boroughs? If so, we will wait with interest to see what happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Alas, the situation is as the hon. Lady describes it. There is no room for political bias. I end up by giving by far the largest grants to Labour boroughs. [HON. MEMBERS: "Shame."] My hon. Friends are too unkind. They bear down upon me. Sadly, that is the fact of the matter and the hon. Lady can see that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a perfectly sensible piece of drafting. It does not have the machiavellian undertone ascribed to it by the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould). I hope that a moment's reflection will lead him to believe that it is administratively quite sensible and that he will not divide the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am slightly confused by the Minister's enthusiastic embracing of the label "machiavellian" in one breath and his disclaiming it in the next. That in itself is machiavellian.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I said that the charge that some members of the Government were more machiavellian than I could not be sustained, the hon. Gentleman chose to read that as though I was saying that I was machiavellian. I was simply making it clear that other members of the Government were not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we were talking the language of comparison. The Minister was at the very least saying that there were none more machiavellian than he.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left with the strong impression—I put it no more powerfully than that—that this is yet another instance of the way in which the Government have got themselves on the hook. They have embraced the principle of banding and have insisted that banding should be on a national basis, at least in England. That constantly gets them into trouble. Instead of being fairly represented according to their value across a proper range, properties are being compressed into bands that may be unsuited to particular areas. That is why the Government have had recourse to this curious piece of drafting. If the Government were concerned about unexpected problems that might arise if it suddenly emerged that some properties had to be placed in new bands, they would deal with it by a different and more specific provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We retain the suspicion that this provision is designed to produce a misleading account of the range of tax liability. We and others will have to do what we can when the confusion occurs, as it will if this measure is implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have had a useful run over the course and we have little chance of persuading the Minister's mind, machiavellian or otherwise, to change, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Many authorities may wish to provide early notification to their tax payers, hoping to receive early payment to help their cashflow. Such authorities could suddenly find that they are rate-capped, and might have to issue a further bill. The proposals should provide for that possibility. We have been debating the complications that might arise from clause 300. This morning we had an extensive discussion on negative rating. Our amendments are important and constructive and Conservative Members should consider them seriously in the interests of local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a county council has to set a substitute tax rate, authorities at district and parish level will also be affected. When a substitute tax rate is set and a tax payer has paid more than he should, whether at county, district or parish level, he will not be able to demand repayment, but the billing authority will decide whether a refund or credit should be given. Clause 31(4) will come into effect after a substitute bill has been issued, for example, if an authority is capped. In such circumstances people might have paid more than the new instalment scheme required because they had paid at the rate of the first bill issued. It would not be unusual for an authority to levy the tax early in the hope that early payment would be made. Weeks afterwards the Department of the Environment could, after examining the budget, find that the local authority was not working within the SSA. Capping would take place and a substitute bill would have to be issued. We are worried that that could affect the basic principles set out in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 31(4)(a) allows the taxpayer to demand the money back. Where no such demand is made, clause 31(4)(b) allows the authority to decide whether to repay or merely to grant a credit against future liability. The amendment removes the first option and leaves the treatment of overpayment to the discretion of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Good reasons underlie the amendment. There is no doubt that the money overpaid belongs to the council tax payer, if the overpayment was due to an administrative arrangement, so there is no danger that the local authority could keep the money. If a substitute bill has been calculated, the collection department of the council will be under extreme pressure to send out new bills immediately. For administrative simplicity there should be just one rule for dealing with overpayments. It would be costly and time consuming to make special arrangements for those people who demanded their money back immediately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If paragraph (a) is allowed to remain, the council tax payer may demand immediate repayment from the treasurer of the local authority. Without uniformity in the arrangements, difficulties will arise for the local authority. Furthermore, under the formula, there are various tiers in the local authority set-up. If the county is capped, people in the district and the parishes can demand the immediate return of the money that they have overpaid. If our amendment were accepted, the local authority would be able to repay or credit council tax payers after a specific time, which would be to the local authority's benefit. To tidy the matter, we believe that the local authority should have the prerogative to arrange credit or repayments en bloc, rather than piecemeal as people demand repayment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the vast majority of cases, the money that the council tax payer demanded would, presumably, become
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
repayable as soon as the next instalment was due. That is probably why the Government are content for the local authority to exercise discretion in the case of people who do not demand their money back. For people who pay by instalments, it would be easier for the adjustment to be made over future instalments. That happens now. Where a demand has been issued because of non-payment and an attachment order has been made to cover court costs, the local authority does not demand the money immediately; it is added to the instalment payment. The reverse should also apply. Any adjustment for overpayment should be made when the next instalment is due. That would be much better for the local authority. It would tidy up the exercise and help people to understand how the local authority functioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this point strongly because various people will be involved. Both the county and the district will be billing authoritities and district bills will vary according to the county and parish precepts. I assume that there would be little upset with the parishes. Will the Minister consider whether parishes will be involved? We were told this morning that parishes precept on districts and the districts then allocate the precepts in the various bands. We asked whether that levy would show on the bill and we were told that it would and the council tax payers would know what their parish had levied. If a district is capped, where will the cap apply? Will it apply to parish precepts, because parishes add to the bill, or will it apply to the districts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This morning, I differed with the Minister about rate support grant in relation to parishes. I now have to hand the example to which I referred. Perhaps, Sir Michael, I could pass it to the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment. It is contrary to what we were told this morning and such matters should be cleared up as we proceed. The Under-Secretary kindly agreed that he would consider the support of parish councils by rate support grant and uniform business rate. I ask him to consider the principle set out by the Department when we discussed that earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are relevant to the working of local government and how it should operate in the event of a substitute rate bill having to be determined. The amendments would tidy up this part of the Bill. Clause 31(4)(b), as amended, would entitle local authorities to make adjustments if a substitute tax bill has to be issued.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Fyfe</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to ask the Under-Secretary a simple question. A council may have to make repayments because the council tax is reduced. If a household has paid by cheque, or cheques jointly from all the occupants—a couple might simply pay the two bills together, which is a common practice—how would any balance be repaid? Would it be repaid to the individuals who claimed, or to the head of a household?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Key</div> <!-- member -->

As ever, I listened carefully to the Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). I recognise the strength of his argument, certainly from the viewpoint of the local authorities. It is a respectable case to make; I see how it would improve an authority's cash flow and ease administration if such a procedure were followed. However, there are other considerations, particularly in respect of the council tax payer. One problem with the amendments is that they would remove a right presently
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
enjoyed by community charge payers—a right inherited from the old rating system—and the local authority would be left to decide whether to refund or to credit the amount against any future liability. I realise that that may be administratively convenient, as it could result in a cash flow benefit for an authority, but the council tax payer's right should come first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only a minority of council tax payers are likely to be affected. Those who make a single payment at the start of the year may wish to recover sums following the setting of a reduced amount of tax, but any cash flow or administrative advantage would be offset by an increased reluctance to pay tax promptly if refunds could not be recovered. We are regularly told that there is a problem in collecting tax from people now. I do not wish to exacerbate that, but I fear that the amendment would have that effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton asked about parishes, and I shall consider his remarks. I am grateful to him for passing me the relevant document and I should like time to consider it properly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a difference of view between the two sides of the Committee, but it is not great. I have said that it is respectable to argue the case from the local authority's view just as it is respectable for me to argue the case from the council tax payer's view. As the amendments would not help the council tax payer, I ask the Committee to reject them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pity that we cannot agree on a course of action that would benefit council tax payers and local authorities. If refunds on demand involved extra administrative costs, those costs would be spread over all council tax payers, including the people asking for refunds. I made it clear that none can deny that a council tax payer is entitled to the refund: it is a question of administration. Early payments help local authorities' cash flows. Similarly, immediate demands for refunds could have an adverse effect on their cash flows.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would benefit the council tax payers and local authorities, yet the Under-Secretary asked the Committee not to support it. I shall not challenge him on the issue—time will tell. Far be it for me to say, "I told you so" when local authorities and local authority associations report the problems that they experience.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett:</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'> It is clear that we have no truck with capping. However, if the Government are seriously to debate that issue as part of the proposed council tax, it is important to explore the issues involved in applying that regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 241 is an exploratory amendment. We seek to discover how the Government see the system operating and to investigate the anomalies and difficulties inherent in a capping system. We want to know how the reserves will be used and how they should be treated when replenishing the resources to be called on in an emergency or for unforeseen expenditure in a financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many examples in recent years of contingency funds having to be used in circumstances that could not have been foreseen at the beginning of the financial year. The hurricane four years ago involved considerable expenditure of local authority resources and additional help from the Government under the Bellwin formula. At present, there are calls on the resources of social services authorities as a result of the inquiries into child abuse, which seem almost endemic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councils of every political colour, from Wandsworth to Leicestershire, from north Wales to Hereford and Worcester have incurred additional, unforeseen expenditure requiring an injection of cash into social services departments. There may be expenditure on ephemeral matters in a particularly bleak winter. Some authorities are better placed than others to deal with such circumstances. Barnet is better able to deal with snow falls in cold winters than Cumbria because Barnet has a better standard spending assessment and puts such expenditure in the mainstream budget. Less fortunate authorities have to do something when roads become dangerous and additional gritting is required. There are a variety of examples—

	<i>Hansard,</i> I explain that a note in braille has arrived. I hope that it is not a new note. Braille is not as easy to catch up in as print, so I shall have to leave it for another day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a variety of reasons why balances must be drawn on. In recent years, authorities had to draw on their balances, which then needed replenishing to ensure that their budgets balanced—a legal requirement—but did not incur capping. Drawing on balances did not affect the collection fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>721</span>
Many authorities drew on balances to avoid unnecessary withdrawal from the collection fund because of the problems created by non-collection, or because of expenditure that did not increase the budget substantially, or at all. For example, in the last year of the Conservative regime in Merton in the run-up to the local government elections, the authority drew £22 million from balances to ensure that expenditure did not run into difficulties under the then capping rules. At the time, it left balances of only £9 million. Obviously, that would make a big difference. We need to explore why replenishing balances through the draw on the collection fund should be countenanced as requiring the Government to count that income for balances for capping purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems extraordinary that the Government can use a macro-economic rationale to justify the capping of local government expenditure without following the logic of that macro-economic factor in the capping regulations. For macro-economic purposes, we are told that capping is necessary because it prevents authorities from incurring excessive increased expenditure which has an unhelpful impact on inflation. Few people believe it, and fewer still can prove it. Nevertheless, that is the justification offered to explain why local government revenue expenditure out of locally raised revenue should be subject to capping.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The United States can hardly be described as an antagonist of free market economics, but no one in that country and few people in the rest of Europe believe that that is necessary for macro-economic purposes, but the Government do. However, no one suggests that replenishing balances has any impact on macro-economic policy, "profligate expenditure" or the inflation level. Replenishing balances is a form of compulsory saving, so if we wanted to be pedantic about its economic impact it is possible to regard it as being deflationary. It could be of benefit as a counterbalance to years of undue expenditure on credit cards and expenditure that was not funded from income in the private or domestic sectors. So we could regard it as having a beneficial effect in replenishing balances that had been used for unforeseen purposes, as the Government find is sometimes necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am devastated by the hon. Gentleman's intervention. It made me recognise the problems that we were up against in trying to argue for sensible revenue-raising powers that did not affect national policy in the slightest but avoided difficulties. Many of us, especially those who were brought up as Methodists, had ingrained in us at our mother's knee that unnecessary borrowing was to be avoided. We should not have had to suffer much of what we had to endure in order to behave sensibly when funding essential provision at local level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we are discussing the amendments. We are involved in the business of raising issues. What happens in regard to the raising and application of balances is true of many other aspects when anomalies arise as a result of the capping of authorities. We recognise that what the Government do with regard to the grant applied to local
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
services is their business. We hope that, in future, what is raised from the business sector for expenditure will be the business of local government, but at present it is the business of central Government, so they take control of that as well. What is raised and applied locally is the business of local government and its electorate. The irony is that even in the application of resources to balances from local revenue the gearing effect will apply. That will have a substantial effect on the triggering of capping in the following year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paradox is that the theoretical reduction of £140 a head in the headline tax increased the difficulty. It benefited the taxpayer, but it made the gearing impact much worse because the amount of local expenditure and freedom to raise money was reduced still further as a percentage of the total budget. That applied when revenue was raised to replenish balances. For every pound that was needed to replenish balances or to increase expenditure, the amount that had to be raised through the collection fund varied from £2 in South Buckinghamshire to an increase of over 11 per cent. in the revenue raised in hard-pressed places such as Tower Hamlets. That was absurd. The simple prudence of having a sufficient balance to avoid a budget moving out of balance one year and, therefore, having to bring it back into balance the next has reached farcical proportions. That is why it is silly to cap, but even dafter to apply the rules in a way that precludes the use of resources for cushioning prudently against unforeseen spending or for other matters, such as expenditure on preparation for the council tax over and above the resources that will come from central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, there will be a daft situation in which the Government will pay a certain sum to prepare for the tax—they say three quarters of the amount—but nobody is clear whether that will be adequate. No one in Committee can tell us, hand on heart, that the resources outlined in the consultants' report that the Government believe are necessary will be sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the discussions that we have had in Committee and the revelations that my hon. Friends and I have elicited from the Government in the past two and a half somewhat fraught weeks, it is not clear what sort of chaos will occur when we try to implement the Bill in April 1993. As a consequence, it is likely that many local authorities will have to find from their balances substantial additional revenue over and above what they planned to spend in a year during that financial year. They will have to draw that down from balances. They will be capped potentially on the sum that they intended for the 1992–93 financial year, so they will have to reduce services simply to prepare for the introduction of the tax. But if local authorities are wrong or the Government's prediction is wrong and they have to draw on balances, they will be capped—if the Conservatives are still in office—for restoring that amount of money in the following financial year. With the best will in the world, that can be described only as Alice-in-Wonderland fantasy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the sort of financial management that causes people in finance and treasury departments to scratch their heads and pull most of their hair out, because they cannot plan sensibly; they find that one decision triggers problems elsewhere. They might have cut parts of the budget to avoid capping and to maintain a prudent balance, only to find that a crisis occurs, which means that a department's budget must be increased. That happened to the social
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
security departments in several authorities which could not be described as imprudent or profligate. The budget that was cut at the beginning of the financial year to avoid capping and to maintain balances had to be increased. That is the height of stupidity and financial imprudence because it leads to a cat-and-mouse game in which authorities react to crises rather than work to prevent them, and respond to an immediate disaster rather than plan to ensure that such circumstances do not arise. We know that it is happening throughout the country, but Ministers simply say that there are no cuts. When cuts are proved to have happened because expenditure is increased in the middle of the financial year to account for the crises in social service departments, the Government brush the problem aside and pretend that the standard spending assessment for social services has gone up by 23 per cent. and, therefore, that the grant and resources have gone up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The experience in Orkney may be repeated throughout the country. Local authorities may refuse to spend any of their balances on checking out the national implications of policies, because they will not be able to replenish their balances without being capped.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to give another example without, I hope, overegging the pudding. I refer to the city challenge scheme. Authorities that have been successful in winning the city challenge scheme for the coming year have been approached about the preparation for those schemes in the current financial year. I am not referring to the problem of raising the 10 per cent. of local resources required on revenue, or to the debt charges that arise out of increased supplementary credit approvals over and above the grant element on revenue, or to capital for next year. That may trigger capping if authorities are already above the standard spending assessment. They will have to cut mainstream services to fund and take on the city challenge scheme. I cannot imagine a more daft idea than a system under which money must be cut with one hand in order to fund a scheme with the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
I am referring to the current financial year when preparation is necessary. We know what has happened in those areas that are controlled by successful authorities. I must declare an interest in that Sheffield was not one of them. However, Sheffield's present services might benefit from it not having won the first round. Perhaps my colleagues in Sheffield would not agree. By having to find resources in preparation for the coming year, some of the successful authorities have had to draw down on balances. Such authorities will have either to cut services further next year, or replenish those balances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Substantial sums are involved in the application of balances nationally. The draw down on balances for the current financial year for non-metropolitan district authorities was £225 million. For metropolitan districts, it was £178 million and for a small number of outer-London districts—not the height of revolutionary politics—it was £45 million. We are discussing large sums of money that are drawn from balances to prepare existing budgets, let alone the draw from balances that takes place during a financial year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an important point; a plethora of competitions are now being introduced. We may not have a state lottery in Great Britain, but we have something akin to it in the Department of the Environment, where policies change and competitions are developed. I wonder if an official at the Department is assisting the Secretary of State in thinking up new competitions now. Perhaps that is why he chooses to join us only briefly most evenings just after 10 o'clock to see how we are doing. Obviously, the right hon. Gentleman must keep his mind clear for new ideas to filter through on housing, the environment, local government spending or inner-city policy, so that he can come up with a radical new proposal to test the ingenuity of local government officers who will have to switch their policies in mid-stream to take on different ones. The city challenge scheme is the tweny first of the inner-city policies that have been developed over the past decade, and if we do not have an early election, the Government could introduce still more proposals before the spring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider the small amount of money, as a percentage of total local authority spending, that is now raised locally. Because of that and the peculiarities of the standard spending assessment, a relatively small change in SSA from one year to another can make an enormous difference to the amount that must be raised at local level to maintain the existing level of expenditure. Authorities that cannot—never mind will not—make draconian reductions in their services very late in the financial year to balance the books for the coming financial year must draw
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>725</span>
down on balances heavily. They must do that so that they can plan sensibly and, if they so choose, reduce the level of expenditure on key services over a sufficient period of time to prevent dislocation. It must be remembered that education and social services, together with highway maintenance, make up the largest tranche of revenue expenditure in those authorities that provide them. Therefore, those authorities have no choice, short of closing their leisure or library facilities, but to draw down on the balances to meet requirements such as that teachers be given a term's notice rather than a month's before they leave employment. Since the north Tyneside judgment, such authorities cannot even offer staff sensible severance payments, as any other service or industry would, to get people to agree to go quickly. After the absurd behaviour of the Audit Commission's legal officers, those authorities must offer compulsory redundancies. That means that they must adhere to the statutory requirements rather than encourage people to co-operate with changes that must be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The result is that Government action and gross and pettifogging interference from the centre have made a mockery of not only local autonomy and democracy but prudent financial planning, including the sensible replenishment and application of balances, free of capping restraints.

The amendment would have a radical effect. It would bring about a major change in the way in which local finances are raised—a change from both the community charge and the rates. The amendment would make it impossible for a local authority, when setting and levying a council tax, to take into account compensation for non-payment by council tax payers in current, previous or future periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Its purpose is two-fold. First, it would remove the monstrous injustice that honest citizens, who pay their fair
	<span class='label label-info column'>726</span>
share of local taxes find themselves surcharged because some of their fellow citizens have not paid. That is totally unjust; it is taxation with no moral basis, and I find it extremely difficult to defend to my constituents. It is time to bring such a pernicious system to an end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the amendment would, for the first time, put real pressure on local authorities to be responsible and efficient in levying local taxes. Of course there are no figures for council tax collection because the tax has not yet been levied. However, figures for the collection of the community charge detail the best and the worst collectors among local authorities. As at September of the current financial year 1991–92, several local authorities had collected 70 per cent. and more of the community charge. Others had not collected 20 per cent—Newham had collected 18 per cent. and Hackney 22 per cent. Of the 10 worst offenders nine were—surprise, surprise—Labour controlled. The tenth was independent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It must be tempting for some Opposition Members to deflect the Committee's attention from the two essential points that I raised, but in the interests of our job in Committee—to throw light on the issues of local government presented by the Bill—we must now allow ourselves to be deflected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One issue is the monstrous injustice currently being suffered by a vast number of honest, law-abiding people who make every effort to pay their local taxes and will continue to do so, and then find that they are surcharged, quite unjustifiably, to take account of non-payment by others. The second issue is the appalling record of mismanagement by certain local authorities in gathering in the money. Many councillors who are in charge of the culpable authorities, some of which I have mentioned, go out of their way to sympathise overtly with non-payers. That is hardly the best way to encourage people to pay their fair dues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two problems. The one about which I feel more strongly is the position of those people who find themselves undeservedly surcharged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian McCartney

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman raise the matter of the uniform business rate and the increasing difficulties that local authorities have in securing funding in that way? I am sure that that is not due to the inability or unwillingness of local businesses to contribute, but it may reflect the growing crisis in business, especially in small and medium-sized companies. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the difficulty that local authorities face in respect of the uniform business rate could be alleviated if, rather than allowing bankruptcies to continue, the Government had a more beneficial effect on the economy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am intrigued but rather encouraged by the way in which the debate on my amendment is proceeding. Although I have gladly allowed Opposition Members to intervene, not one of them has taken issue with the substance of my amendment. Not one of them has dared to support my amendment, but they have tried to divert attention to other subjects—for example, the 20 per cent. minimum to be paid on the community charge, which does not relate to the matter, and the UBR, another fascinating and important matter but one that has nothing to do with my amendment. I draw comfort from that and I hope the Committee will feel that it is not entirely unreasonable of me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An obvious question arises if there is general sympathy with the two principles that I put forward, and I detect that there may be sympathy even among Opposition Members, as well as among Conservative Members. What would happen if my amendment—or a technically effective version of it—were accepted? What would happen if a local authority failed to collect all the council tax that was due? I do not shirk that question and the answer is simple. It would not be able to spend money that it had not collected and would have to reduce its expenditure by the total amount of uncollected council tax. For example, let us assume that 15 per cent. of a local authority's resources depended on the council tax, with the balance of 85 per cent. coming from the revenue support grant and the
	<span class='label label-info column'>728</span>
business rate. If it achieved a collection rate of 50 per cent., 7·5 per cent. of its revenue would not be available to it and it would have to reduce its expenditure by 7·5 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any business or individual who finds that his income has declined must reduce expenditure. Does any local authority in this country live in a completely unreal world in which it does not have to reduce expenditure when its income falls? It is fundamentally false to expect local authorities to exercise proper financial management and custodianship of tax payers' resources under the provisions of the Bill. The position is thoroughly unsatisfactory and if my amendment or a technically effective version of it were accepted, the problem would be solved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have heard from the Opposition neither an acknowledgement of the need for good management in local government—there are still two days to go, so I have not given up hope—nor any expression of sympathy for the honest citizen who pays his taxes and finds himself surcharged. If they undergo a change of heart as a result of my amendment on those two important issues, I shall feel well satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I thank my colleagues who encouraged me to table the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman have information about the amount that the Department of Social Security owes to local authorities for non-payment of benefit due to poll tax payers and other taxpayers? If the hon. Gentleman would check how much is outstanding from the DSS, especially to Labour authorities which have to cater for low-income groups that are entitled to benefits, I am sure that he would find that a substantial sum is due because of the delay in DSS payments. He should take that factor into consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman talked about good management, so I hope that he will apply the same principle to those in the industrial and commercial sector who are in arrears with their taxes. Obviously, such a failure to pay taxes creates problems for local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 264 is designed to remove subsection (6) of clause 32. That subsection refers to subsection (2)(a) and gives instructions as to what a local authority shall take into account in the calculation of budget requirement. Subsection (6) also states that the authority shall take into account the amount of any precept issued. The billing authority will influence the amount of payments to be made, even though it has no jurisdiction over the precepting authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to passenger transport authorities, waste disposal authorities, land drainage, magistrates courts and probation committees. All of them could be involved with that principle because the measure of expenditure from council tax for capping purposes is an authority's budget requirement calculated under clause 32 for billing authorities and under clause 43 for major precepting authorities. The amendment would mean that an authority would not have to take account of the amount of local precepts in calculating the budget requirement. Until now, parish precepts have not influenced the capping procedures for district councils, but under the Bill the Secretary of State can take them into consideration. It is important, therefore, to refer to such issues in our discussion of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>729</span>
6 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 264 would leave out of account, in calculating the budget requirement, the amount of local precept, including that of parishes and levies. Those amounts would be taken into account when setting the council tax in total. Under poll tax capping it has been a bone of contention that expenditure over which an authority has little or no control scores as part of that expenditure for capping purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to the defence of local authorities and the interests of community charge payers. There are different ways of viewing that. People look forward to having services. When organisations such as passenger transport authorities—whose precepts influence capping—withdraw their services, Joe Public suffers. Therefore, it is not simply a matter of saying that local authorities are not defended if we do not agree to arrears being paid with current bills. There are different ways of defending local government, and one is to consider the services that are provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 264 would omit subsection (6) from the Bill. The precepting authorities which must provide the services would not then be included in the expenditure that would necessitate capping a billing authority. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) in appealing to Ministers to take account of the influence of subsection (6) on local authorities' expenditure. Without the subsection, the billing authorities would at least be able to influence their expenditure. That would permit parishes, drainage boards, magistrates courts, passenger transport authorities and other precepting authorities to influence their expenditure. Therefore, the Committee should accept amendment No. 264.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I hope that my hon. Friends on the Government Front Bench listened carefully and will respond favourably to the gist of what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment reflects the anger among our constituents as they see the possibility of surcharges because their local authorities have been unwilling to pursue the non-payers. That anger has been compounded by the fact that all too often such action has followed the endeavours of some Labour leaders of councils in actively dissuading people from paying. This is not the time to debate whether those individuals themselves have paid, but they have dissuaded others from paying and then, at the end of the year, said that they will leave it to the charge payer next year. Councils will do nothing to pursue the non-payers, but expect the Government, and through them tax payers, to pick up the tab. That is not fair or reasonable and I would be surprised if the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman believe the claim that the Government have already abolished the poll tax? That claim was put about in March and April last year in anticipation of the Bill. Does that have any bearing on the difficulties of collection this year? Many people believe that there is no longer a poll tax, but, of course, they will face a poll tax bill this year and next year. Councils will face the same collection difficulties because of the 20 per cent. retention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most law-abiding citizens believe that they should pay whatever taxes are due, national or local, so long as they are in force. That is all that is required. It is reprehensible for politicians of any party to say, "Don't pay", because that example is all too often followed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding said that his amendment may not be perfect. I suspect that a tiny number of non-payment cases is inevitable—perhaps because individuals have vanished and cannot be traced. Possibly a maximum of 1 per cent. non-payment might be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We always want to be fair to the Opposition when making comparisons. This morning we compared the London boroughs of Lambeth and Wandsworth with Wigan and other boroughs. We were taken to task for not being willing to compare London with Lancashire and the north. I shall do just that, and compare the non-collection of the London boroughs of Hackney and Lambeth—Labour-controlled boroughs—not with Conservative-held inner London boroughs or with Conservative-held outer London boroughs, or Conservative-held boroughs anywhere, but with Labour-held boroughs in the north-west and north-east such as Salford and Gateshead. Last year, they respectively collected 103 per cent. and 104 per cent. of the community charge owing to them based on their expectations of what was due to them and with all the complications of the 20 per cent. to which Opposition Members have refered. If they can do it, why cannot other boroughs in other parts of the country under Labour party leadership do the same?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the points made about the 20 per cent. difficulties are irrelevant to the debate. Clause 32 is about the council tax, not the community charge, under which there will be rebates up to a maximum of 100 per cent. That should make it even easier to collect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blunkett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One important factor remains. In the London authorities mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, the turnover rate or the change of population, is incredibly high. We tried to spell out in an earlier debate, when Conservative Members were perhaps unwilling to listen, that inner London boroughs suffer a turnover rate of 40 per cent. or 50 per cent. The council tax will have the same problem. It is turnover that has made collection so difficult for some boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. He has shifted the argument from the 20 per cent. to the turnover of the electorate. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman, now I shall consider Conservative-held London boroughs. The London borough with probably the highest turnover of any—Kensington and Chelsea—last year collected 105 per cent. We can provide evidence of collectability if the hon. Gentleman wants to use that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding. However it is drafted, it is reasonable and acceptable to the vast majority of people in this country. It will put to bed the "can't pay, won't pay" syndrome of the community charge and, worse, the "can pay, won't pay, won't ask other people to pay and won't collect" hallmark of too many Labour authorities.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This debate links with our discussion this morning of how local authorities' level of spending has been penalised, year in and year out. In trying to take account of that, they are forced to utilise their balances in a way that is not financially prudent in terms of the level of reserves that they have now compared with a few years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State for Wales, who eventually had the good grace to reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), made a snide political remark about south Yorkshire, and about Sheffield in particular. I do not complain about that—I do not expect anything else from him. However, Sheffield's expenditure level per adult was £773, the average for metropolitan districts was £915. Despite its expenditure level being so far below the average, Sheffield was capped, even after taking out millions of pounds from the planned balances. In common with other local authorities that I mentioned this morning, its reserves and its services were reduced, and it was poll-capped. That was a three-card trick played under Department of Environment rules. Even when authorities play by those rules, at the end of the game many of them are automatically losers of tens of millions of pounds from their balances and reserves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a political background to the issue of balances, which some call reserves and some contingency funds. Conservative-controlled authorities have tended to use their balances not for the improvement and development of services but for short-term party-political gain in the year before an election. Labour councils taking control after the elections have had to balance a budget whose resources have been dissipated by Conservative local councillors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past decade, fewer and fewer Conservatives have been in control of local government. Labour councils trying to maintain balances and to be financially prudent find changes in the financial game and lose substantially. In 1986–87, Wigan local authority was criticised by the then Secretary of State for having balances of £15 million. The balances were externally audited and found to be at a prudent level for a local authority of its size. By 31 March 1992, the planned level of balances will be down to £6·5 million. The external auditor has already told the authority that that is at least £2·5 million less than is prudent in the current financial arrangements. Given the statement that was made last week, the Department of the Environment will continue to insist that my authority will either have to remove completely from its calculations the £6·5 million or cut substantially its core services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following last week's announcement by the Secretary of State, it seems that Wigan metropolitan borough council is facing a £20 million or more gap between the capped budget and the forecast of expenditure requirements. Even if the council takes £6·5 million from its balances—which is already more than the level at which it should be—it would still be short of more than £13·5 million for its 1992–93 budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about not only a massive reduction in the level of balances, but a frontal attack on the core services provided by the authority. It is in a no-win situation. It cannot choose between balances or services. Under the present circumstances, there will be no choice; its level of
	<span class='label label-info column'>732</span>
services will have to be reduced dramatically, as will the level of balances. What will happen when the external auditors issue an official public letter, as they are required to do under the provisions, advising my local authority that its balances are at a dangerously low level? Will the right hon. Gentleman issue a statement in support of the local authority and its intentions to reduce the balances, or will he, once again, tongue in cheek, attack the local authority for reducing its balances to a level below which the external auditors say is necessary to maintain a financially viable set of balances for its size?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The £13 million gap consists of seven elements. There is pay and price inflation, which is outside the control of the local authority. Setting pay levels is the direct responsibility of the Secretary of State for the Environment. We must consider the revenue implications of the Government's approved capital programme for the local authority. The capital programme that was approved by the local authority has direct implications for its revenue budget. Over the past two years, much of the revenue budgets of metropolitan authorities, following the tapering of the capital programme requirements, has been met from revenue accounts. Shortfalls have had to be met from the revenue balances. If local authorities, such as Wigan, having maintained a level to take account of the shortfall, find that that is part of the calculation for capping, they will automatically have to reduce the revenue requirements of the Government's imposed capital levels. That will result in their having to reduce services or even close some of their capital projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, a new youth centre has been constructed under the capital programme in Platt Bridge where I live. But, because of revenue implications, that centre cannot operate full-time. It makes no sense that an authority must try to meet from its balances the revenue implications of a Government-approved programme of capital expenditure in socially deprived areas. If such expenditure is not reduced, the authority will be capped. This year, even if the Wigan local authority reduces it balances, it will still be capped. As a result, its services will be reduced as will its provision of capital projects. Its capability of providing core services will be reduced, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about passenger transport authorities? The calculation of standard spending assessments of local authorities has put them in a ludicrous position. It seems that my authority provides bus and train services but that Greater Manchester council does not. The way in which the Government have allocated resources for passenger transport authorities means a savage behind-the-scene cut in those services. That necessitates local authorities, such as Wigan, having to get below the capping level and having to decide on the level of expenditure for public transport that is outside its control or decide whether to cut resources in core services, such as health, social services, education or its own local highway programme. That is totally unacceptable and it is dishonest for the Government to produce such a calculation to force local authorities into that position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the fall in income because of the recession. I do not mean to be cruel to the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies), but he should not lecture local authorities about multi-million pound expenditure when he could not find sufficient capital expenditure for his flock of sheep when he went on holiday for a fortnight. It is a bit rich for the hon. Gentleman to criticise local authorities for their level of expenditure and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>733</span>
to challenge the veracity of local authority councillors and borough treasurers who maintain multi-million pound budgets. That is not on. The hon. Gentleman may find my comments disgraceful, but I am making an honest, matter of fact point. If hon. Members criticise the way in which individuals run local authority services, they should look in their own back yards. They should not throw bricks at Opposition Members. That is all I have to say about the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's comments are ludicrous. He descends to personal abuse rather than deal with the serious point that I made in my amendment.

	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I was not descending to personal abuse. I would not behave in that way to the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding as I have served on many Committees with him. He seeks in his amendment to abuse local authorities and to suggest that some of them—Labour controlled in the main—are deliberately not keeping within the law. That is an unfair assertion given the hon. Gentleman's background on keeping within the law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital for the Government, for the first time in our debates, to come some way towards accepting the case put by my hon. Friends. Unplanned calls on resources usually happen every winter. Sometimes the south-east is hit harder than the north-east or the north-west. However, unplanned calls on resources are not just because of bad winter weather. In other circumstances local authorities rightly have to seek permission from the Secretary of State before expenditure is outlayed. It is vital to have regulations in the Bill that prevent local authorities from being poll tax capped because of an unplanned use of resources and calls on their balances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must ensure that local authorities maintain balances at a prudent level. It makes no sense and is highly irresponsible of Ministers to force local authorities to keep balances at a level below those recommended by external auditors. The Government imposed those external auditors on local authorities. At the time I had no objection to the introduction of a critical eye from outside, as long as it was aimed at developing services and maintaining a friendship with local authorities by critically and positively looking at the way in which they provide value for money and services. In most instances that is the way in which they operate. Most external auditors have a good working relationship with local authorities. Neither is in each other's pockets; they work in different areas but come to the same conclusion about the delivery of services and giving value for money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is vital for the Minister to take account of the fact that external auditors—not just in my authority but across the country—are suggesting that the Government are forcing local authorities to have balances that are below what is, in their words, prudently advisable. The Government should listen to the advice of the external auditors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfair on authorities such as Sheffield, Wigan, Doncaster, Rotherham, Barnsley, St. Helens—I must mention St. Helens because my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, North (Mr. Evans) and I share a boundary—and Wakefield, which is a good rugby league town, to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>734</span>
put in the situation of having to raid their balances to maintain services or to escape capping. Some of them, such as Wigan and Sheffield, were criticised for the level of their balances, but having used them, they still have to eat into core services and they still get capped. The Government must not force local authorities to try to escape capping by taking from their balances millions of pounds—which should be used for other purposes—to provide core services. That is not what balances should be for. Nor should it be the Secretary of State's role, after forcing local authorities to resort to their balances, to cap them and so reduce dramatically the level of services that are provided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Primarolo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to deal with a relatively brief, but important point in connection with balances and the way in which the Government include them in SSA calculations, with the result that capping is wrongly imposed. I shall use the county of Avon as an example. I wish to demonstrate that the changes have influenced dramatically authorities' ability to fund their budgets and avoid capping. By that means, I hope to show why the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) should be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before 1990–91, the Government's assumption was that the national level of interest was divided between the different categories of authorities—counties and districts—in proportion to the income that they received. Within the total county element, local authorities received a share in proportion to their total SSA. That was a recognition of the relative availability of budgets and the way in which they were used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1989–90, 29·6 per cent. of the national total of interest receipts was allocated to county councils and 29·3 per cent. to shire districts. The current system changed the arrangements. The Government's total provision for interest receipts for 1990–91 is £857 million and that is divided between all authorities on a pro rata basis according to their total SSA for services. The logic for that is that balances are said to be proportional to expenditure levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1991–92, 49·9 per cent. of the national total was allocated to counties, and only 7·5 per cent. to shire districts. As a result of that incredible formula, the Department of the Environment's assessment of interest assumed to be earned by the county of Avon jumped from £6·3 million in 1989–90 to £14·3 million in 1991–92. To achieve that income, the county of Avon would need an average of balances of £135 million. In fact, the county's 1991–92 receipts from its balances was £8·3 million. However, the Government, having decided what they thought the interest from the county's balances should be, took that estimated income and inserted it into the SSA for the purpose of calculating whether the authority should be capped. As a result, Avon was considerably disadvantaged.

The procedure must be changed to allow the proper benefits to the counties to be assessed. It is important that while SSAs continue to exist, they should be constructed on an equitable basis because of the need for proper accountability and because they are used as the yardstick for capping controls. The Avon county treasurer argues—and I agree with him—that there should be a return to the old method of calculating the SSA, because the current system does not reflect the relative ability of authorities to generate interest and receipts from their balances. A reversion to the old system would give Avon an additional

£7 million for 1991–92. The amendment would enable local authorities to meet the requirements for balanced budgets so that, they could provide services adequately without having to operate on make-believe figures produced by the Department of the Environment's computer, based on an unrealistic and unintelligible formula.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief so that my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) can speak. When the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) spoke to amendment No. 232 we glimpsed what Conservative Members are like when they are let off the leash. It was not a particularly pretty sight. The hon. Gentleman worked himself into a lather of indignation and enthusiasm. He even managed to delude himself that he had persuaded the Committee to support the amendment. I shudder to think what we would have had to put up with if his speech had been delivered after, instead of before, dinner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was disingenuous in disclaiming responsibility for the amendment on the grounds that, in common with the amendments of all Back-Bench Members, it was technically deficient. He implied that the drafting of the amendment was slightly imprecise but that its thrust was rational, sensible and practical. In fact, it was technically deficient because it was totally irrational, unworkable and vindictive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Allan Stewart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would agree that the essence of the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) was that loss of income from non-collection of the community charge should not be passed on to council tax payers. That is precisely what Opposition amendment No. 303 would achieve in Scotland. Why does the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) take a different view of the matter north and south of the border?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) will no doubt deal with that matter better than I—he will speak to amendment No. 303.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding disclaimed responsibility for the technical deficiencies of the amendment but it would be useful to examine them. He seemed to realise that he was wrong to use the word "arrears", and no doubt he meant to specify "deficits".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Arrears are often not consequence of non-payment but of late payment. Unfortunately, late payment is an experience fairly common to all authorities—indeed, to all creditors. There may be good reasons for late payment, and most authorities make strenuous efforts to collect arrears. As drafted, the amendment would cause enormous problems because budgets would have to be changed to account for the payment of arrears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment contains further peculiarities. It does not mention the treatment of surpluses, yet for reasons of symmetry and good sense they should be included. The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding and the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) referred to authorities that have a collection rate of more than 100 per cent. The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding did not seem to realise that the amendment would affect the shire districts, but not the counties—it would affect the billing but not the precepting authorities. There would be no justice or good sense in that because failure to collect arrears may arise for reasons that are not the district authority's fault. It would
	<span class='label label-info column'>736</span>
be unfair if the shire district authorities had to bear the burden that hon. Gentleman seeks to place on them. The Bill recognises that is schedule 10. Paragraph 23(3) states
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State may be regulations make provision"</p></blockquote>
for any surplus or deficit to be shared out between the billing authority and the precepting authority in accordance with the rules that the Secretary of State may make. Surely that is good sense. The responsibility for those surpluses and deficits may not be the fault or responsibility of the district authority, so it is only fair to share the burden and the benefit with the other authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment was not so much to amend the Bill but to enable the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding and his hon. Friends to address the question, which I suppose is in order, of differential collection rates for community charge or poll tax under present legislation. The hon. Gentleman was trying to point a finger particularly at Labour-controlled local authorities for their alleged failure to collect poll tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main purpose of my amendment was to draw attention to, and to provide some relief for, those who suffer from the monstrous and scandalous injustice of being surcharged to take account of the non-payment of tax by other citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than dealing with that point, the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould), who neither wants to incur odium by saying in public that the present system is fine and that it is right that honest citizens who pay their way should be surcharged, nor wants to agree with my amendment, is doing exactly what I anticipated he would do when I moved it. The hon. Gentleman is trying to lock us in the technical detail. He will not acknowledge the essential issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman wants to deal with the essential issue he should answer the question that my hon. Friend the Minister asked him. The hon. Gentleman is on record as taking a different position on this issue in relation to Scotland. How can he possibly justify speaking with forked tongue—one way for one side of the border and another way for the other?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We see yet again another example of the hon. Gentleman in full flight. I hope that he can be persuaded to resume his seat and to keep his seat after dinner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That remark was ambiguous and was not helpful. Whether it is the reception of the hon. Gentleman's remarks or the remarks themselves that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) would find unusual I do not know. Perhaps we should return to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who were in the Committee a couple of evenings ago will know what I mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. It seems that I have sufficiently discomfited Opposition Members this afternoon that every possible insult will be thrown at me before we rise tonight. I am prepared for that and perfectly happy about it. Nevertheless, if the hon. Member for Dagenham is trying to cast some personal aspersion, may I, through you, Sir Michael, ask him to make it absolutely specific so that you may rule whether his implications are in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If any remarks were out of order, I should have drawn attention to them. We are now moving

	<span class='label label-info column'>737</span>
into the happy hour. We always seem to have this curious interlude in a normally well-behaved Committee. Perhaps we can now continue with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the repeated interventions from the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding, personal aspersions from me are entirely beside the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman does not seem to grasp the point that the system that he so bitterly attacks has operated for many years—indeed, from time immemorial.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me make the point. Surely the hon. Gentleman realises that by these constant interventions he is making the point that he fears I was trying to make. He is validating his own worst suspicions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Keith Mans 
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall first develop the point that so alarmed and exercised the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding and then allow the hon. Member for Wyre (Mr. Mans) to come to his rescue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason that the system that the hon. Gentleman so excoriates passed without comment for so long is that under the rates, it caused no problems. The hon. Gentleman is expressing alarm and despondency and defending people against surcharges with such fervour because the collection level of the poll tax and, potentially, the council tax is so much lower than it was under the rates. There was always a tiny element of non-collection of rates, but it was so small that it was considered a natural part of the business of local taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That will not come as a blinding relevation to the hon. Gentleman because the Prime Minister, when he finally steeled himself to say that the poll tax would have to go, did so on the precise and specific basis that it was "virtually uncollectable". In case anyone says that by quoting him I am somehow encouraging people not to pay, I insist that it was the Prime Minister who made that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon. Gentleman tell the Committee why he takes a different view on the substance of my hon. Friend's amendment north and south of the border?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has had a great stroke of inspiration and asked a question that has already been asked twice. The answer will be provided by my hon. Friend who will make it clear that the effect of the amendment would not be what the hon. Gentleman claims. My hon. Friend will offer an excellent explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to my argument, which Conservative Members are unwilling to accept. The Prime Minister admitted that the poll tax was virtually uncollectable. The Conservative Central Office handout to party workers on the council tax stated that the reason for abandoning the poll tax was that people could not be persuaded that it was fair. That is a statement of the fact that it was uncollectable and the reason why, although only a partial reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no problem in collecting the rates and, as we have shown, no problem in collecting the community charge in authorities controlled by parties of all political persuasions, in spite of the 20 per cent. payment and turnover problems. Does the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>738</span>
Gentleman accept that the problem in some Labour areas is that too many of his senior colleagues in local government and Parliament campaigned for people not to pay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The repeated attempt by the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis) to sweep aside the careful findings of the Audit Commission and other independent bodies that considered collection problems such as a constantly moving population and the 20 per cent. payment, does him no credit and adds nothing to the credibility of his case. My answer flows directly from the Government's admission, with which Conservative Members are clearly uncomfortable, that the poll tax is virtually uncollectable because people could not be persuaded that it was fair. There are other reasons why it was uncollectable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have asked the Government at least twice in Committee to give extra resources to local authorities to run campaigns which would include leaflets and television and radio advertising. On both occasions our request was rejected. As recently as last week, the Secretary of State made it clear that local authorities would have to run such campaigns with existing resources. That means that they will have to risk capping to get their poll tax in. That is the Government's highly irresponsible attitude.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>6·45 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right. The leader of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the leader of Newcastle council, has, to my certain knowledge, written to the Secretary of State to express great concern about the difficulties that local government has experienced trying to collect the poll tax. He suggested that an advertising campaign directed at the population at large should be funded by central Government. That would displace the false idea generated by the Government for their short-term political purposes, that the poll tax has gone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to make my point at some length, so the hon. Gentleman will have plenty of time to contemplate his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inherent difficulties of poll tax collection have been grossly exacerbated by the Government's cack-handed and craven attempt to distance themselves from the poll tax while lacking the political will to kill it off. As a consequence, we are going through an uncomfortable period of limbo in which many people have been persuaded by Government progaganda—not least by the Prime Minister who assured 
	<i>The House Magazine</i> that the poll tax has been abolished. People are being persuaded that the poll tax has gone, but they are still required to pay it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem has been made worse by the Government's ineptitude which I would call double dealing, because they pretend that one situation obtains while they enforce another. The Government's practical measures have made life worse for local government. At very short notice, they introduced a community charge reduction scheme which meant that all calculations had to be redone and, in some cases, rebilling had to occur. The same point arose because of the Government's use of capping power. In many cases local authorities were forced to send out new bills with all the delay, uncertainty and confusion that that entails.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0428">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>739</span>
It does not lie well in the mouths of Conservative Members to pretend that all problems of collection are somehow due to the deficiencies of Labour local authorities. The Government cannot escape responsibility. First, they introduced a fatally flawed tax. Secondly, they admitted that it was fatally flawed and virtually uncollectable, but failed to do anything to get rid of it. Thirdly, they messed local government about so much that it has found it difficult to send out bills in good time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Squire 
	<div class='memberconstituency'> (Hornchurch)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must obviously be right when he says that the fault does not lie entirely with Labour authorities. Perhaps he can reconcile his argument that local authorities have experienced difficulties collecting the poll tax and that people in general believe that the poll tax has been abolished with the fact that adjacent to Newcastle lies Gateshead which has collected over 100 per cent. of the money that it expected to collect? It is Labour controlled, so I agree with the hon. Gentleman's first point. Will he comment further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman is willing to go some way and recognise that some problems are intrinsic to the poll tax. However, he says that those problems have been overcome in some parts of the country. He cites as evidence that in some authorities over 100 per cent. of the assumed poll tax has been collected, but that tells us only that the original calculation may have been somewhat flawed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman appears to be accusing Gateshead council of making a flawed calculation. That is a serious charge and an unpleasant slur on Gateshead council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that he will want to withdraw it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I never made such a slur on Gateshead council, I have no intention of withdrawing it. The point that I was making was that the calculation that 100 per cent., or more, of the poll tax has been collected tells us nothing about the difficulties of collecting it. The hon. Gentleman should also recognise that I raised the point about the leader of Newcastle council not on behalf of Newcastle but on behalf of local government as a whole. The problems that we are discussing, although some hon. Members have not the good sense to recognise it, are common to a large proportion of local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman care to reflect upon the remarks that he made about a lack of money being provided by central Government for councils to advertise and to find other ways of increasing their collection rates, in the light of the remarks that he made in an earlier debate that criticised Brent council for taking and funding out of its own resources precisely those steps to collect the council tax? Would he also care to reflect on the Liverpool council that had a collection rate for the rates lower than that for the community charge?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, Jeremy Beecham did not suggest that local authorities should be encouraged to advertise that the poll tax was still in existence and had to be collected; he suggested that central Government might do that. That is a central Government responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is little point trying to pick out, although I understand why Conservative Members do it, individual local authorities and measuring their performance against others when the basic problem, as I have
	<span class='label label-info column'>740</span>
demonstrated beyond doubt and preadventure, is common to local government as a whole. If that were not so, why should the Prime Minister say that the poll tax was virtually uncollectable? Does anyone disagree with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman disagree with the Prime Minister on that? If that is not the point on which the hon. Gentleman seeks to intervene, perhaps he would wait for a moment. I shall make my point, but if the hon.

	<p>

I shall sit down in a moment. I want to be specific about what the Committee is now on edge to hear from the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By rising, the hon. Gentleman volunteered to speak when I invited any Conservative Member to disagree with or distance himself from the Prime Minister's assertion that the poll tax was virtually uncollectable. I am surprised that he did so because I imagined that the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) would be the only Conservative Member to do so, for he is the one person who remains a die-hard supporter of the poll tax or, as he prefers to call it, the community charge. I am not sure whether the Minister wants to rise—we shall see. As the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. Brandon-Bravo) has volunteered to tell us why he disagrees with the Prime Minister's assertion, I gladly give way to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brandon-Bravo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree with the Prime Minister. The mere fact that the Bill exists shows that we have accepted the limitations of the original poll tax. We have conceded on the problems of collectability. Such problems have brought about the change. The hon. Gentleman has been asked many times whether he disclaims completely any responsibility for the problems of non-collection that resulted from the actions and statements of hon. Members and councillors who campaigned against the tax. Is the hon. Gentleman really saying that that is irrelevant and has played no part in the problems faced by local authorities in trying to collect tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was delighted to hear the hon. Gentleman agree with the Prime Minister that the poll tax was virtually uncollectable. Other hon. Members did not intervene, so by implication they agree with the Prime Minister and the hon. Gentleman. I assume from that that they accept that local authorities have serious problems in trying to collect the poll tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point that the hon. Gentleman raises, let me make it clear that the Labour party has always set its face against non-payment and breaking the law. We have made that clear on so many occasions that it becomes wearying to have to repeat it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend, unlike the hon. Gentleman, has read the research carried out by Dr. Alan Sproul of Strathclyde university into the collectability of the poll tax in Strathclyde region, which showed that the vast majority—over 80 per cent.—of those who had not paid their poll tax in the first year of its working in Strathclyde region
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>741</span>
were on the bread line. They were those who simply could not afford to pay, who were on benefit and who had existing debts that they could not afford to pay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend leads me to my next point. The principal reason for the uncollectability of the poll tax, according to the Tory party, is its unfairness. There are two other reasons, both accepted by implication from time to time by Conservative Members, but pushed aside when they try to make rather disreputable political points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first reason is that the proportion of people who move during the course of a year is much higher than anybody had foreseen. The Audit Commission has stated clearly that that is the case. The average turnover on a poll tax register is 40 per cent. It rises to 50 per cent. in some cases, and in some inner-London boroughs it is as high as 60 per cent. That is an extremely high proportion and the Audit Commission advances that as a major reason why collecting the poll tax is proving so difficult. It is no accident that the inner-London boroughs where this factor does its greatest damage to the collection of the poll tax are the areas most likely to be controlled by a Labour local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point which hon. Members are unwilling to accept is that the 20 per cent. contribution rule means, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said, that huge efforts are being made by local authorities under legal duress—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Let me make the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis </div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is the wrong point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will be the judge of that. If the hon. Gentleman will resume his seat, he will see how right the point is that I am about to make. The point is declared to be right, powerful and persuasive by the Audit Commission, which produced an overpowering case for abolishing the 20 per cent. contribution rule. The commission makes it clear that the effort that local authorities must expend to collect the 20 per cent. is simply not worth the revenue collected. It costs £15 for every £6 net collected from those liable to pay the 20 per cent. contribution. That is an important factor behind the difficulties faced by local authorities in trying to collect the poll tax. It does Conservative Members no justice and no credit if they refuse to accept that familiar and powerful point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only is it the wrong point—it is the wrong tax. There is no 20 per cent. contribution under the council tax, which is what the Bill and the amendment are about. Setting aside the difficulties of collecting the community charge, will the hon. Gentleman accept that, with the slate wiped clean and the new tax in place, there should be no excuse for non-collection of that tax, and that it is, therefore, reasonable for a penalty to be imposed on any council that fails to do so?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In attempt to make what he considers to be the right point, the hon. Gentleman has handed me my case. If the council tax, freed from the great burden of the 20 per cent. contribution rule, can be collected with relative ease, it will prove no more of a difficulty in that respect than the rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>742</span>
Therefore, the hon. Gentleman immediately concedes my case that the problems of collecting the poll tax are largely due to the precise rules that require everybody to make a contribution, a principle that I imagine Conservative Members without exception—perhaps the exceptions would stand up or otherwise show themselves—support to the hilt. They are now wriggling because they do not want to admit their support for a discredited principle that still causes such a nightmare to local authorities. They do no justice to local government or themselves by trying to pretend otherwise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If local councillors had voted for such an absurd scheme—it has brought financial ruin on so many people—they would all face bankruptcy. The Comptroller and Auditor General would have surcharged every one of them for an enormous sum.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend draws an interesting contrast between Tory party members who are Members of Parliament and who have demeaned themselves by trying to avoid those arguments, and Conservative party members who are active in local government. It is significant that leading Conservatives in local government understand the problems of collecting the poll tax. My friend Jeremy Beecham, who acted on behalf of the AMA, begged the Secretary of State to advertise that the poll tax was still in existence and had to be paid. It was no accident that he was joined in that request by Lady Anson, the leader of the Tory-controlled Association of District Councils. That is an object lesson to Conservative Members. If they do not have the common sense and decency to admit to the problems, they should look to the example set to them by their colleagues in local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Sir Michael. For the past hour or so, my hon. Friends and I, and Conservative Members, have addressed the substantive speech made by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies). That speech was in order and it was about the collection of the poll tax. In response, I am trying to make interventions that will be helpful to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend give way? Will my hon. Friend ask the Minister what will happen under the council tax in magistrates courts such as that at Bournemouth, which has to deal with almost 14,000 liability orders but which can deal with 32 cases per hour only? What will happen at the court in Weston-super-Mare which has 6,910 liability orders, but which deals with 1,063 per hour? What will happen if we cannot resolve those problems?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend is right; the council tax, being a more complicated tax even than the poll tax, will cause enormous problems. It has all the disadvantages and difficulties of a head tax, as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland repeatedly said, but it has the additional complication of being a new and untried property tax. It will be extremely difficult to administer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem to which my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) draws attention was ignored by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding when he tried to point the finger at Labour local authorities. The whole of local government is engaged in what is probably the biggest debt-collection exercise in the history of the world—but if anyone can think of a bigger one I should be grateful if he would let me know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mans</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman were to go to South America, he would find that virtually every country on that continent, including Brazil and Argentina, have much larger debt collections than local authorities in this country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rather doubt that. That was typical of the blithe confidence with which the hon. Gentleman makes totally unsubstantiated assertions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There was a query in the hon. Member's comment that went very wide of the amendment and perhaps the answer was very wide. Perhaps we may now return to the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is entirely relevant, Sir Michael. I challenge the hon. Gentleman to produce evidence of any other exercise in which 7·5 million summonses for the same debt in respect of the same obligation were issued. That is the position that confronts us under the virtually uncollectable poll tax. We are faced with a £1·5 billion deficit and 7·5 million summonses. That is why my hon. Friend was right to point to the overwhelming problems that are clogging the magistrates courts and why the police are saying that they are incapable, because of their manpower levels, of getting involved in ensuring that those obligations are met. Characteristically, the hon. Gentleman is on a flyer and I have caught him out on one or two occasions in the past. It was a brave effort, but 7·5 million summones is an impressive and worrying total.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons it is quite wrong, and typically destructive of local government morale, to suggest that the problems arose because of the lack of care and concern on the part of local authorities. The whole of local government is caught up in a maelstrom of difficulties created by the poll tax in the first instance and the conditions now brought about by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way when I have completed this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>744</span>
If Conservative Members had a shred of decency they would face that problem. It is a nightmare for local government and it explains why there is such difficulty in collecting the poll tax. The hon. Gentleman's amendment is nothing more than a rather disreputable diversion from that central problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been speaking for nearly 40 minutes and he has not even begun to talk about the essential issue raised by my amendment, which is whether he considers it right and fair that virtuous, honest payers of council tax should be surcharged on account of its non-payment by others. Is his determination to avoid answering that question merely the result of prolixity induced by what you, Sir Michael, euphemistically described as the happy hour or is it due to serious, profound, political embarrassment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had sat down, so I plead not guilty to any charge of prolonging my remarks. However, before I sit down again, I shall try to answer the hon. Gentleman's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is attempting, not to save people from paying more under the poll tax legislation, but merely to bring under the control of the capping powers the element of expenditure, or loss of income, represented by the inevitable problems which local authorities face in trying to collect the poll tax. In other words, I repeat that he is engaged in a disreputable exercise of trying to shift responsibility and blame from his Government, who created those horrific circumstances, to the local authorities which are trying to wrestle with the problem. I shall give way, but I warn the Minister that if I am further accused of prolixity by his hon. Friends I shall point the finger at him for encouraging me to remain on my feet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Portillo</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that I can take the hon. Gentleman's finger. I could not sit idly by and watch my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) attack the hon. Gentleman unfairly and not leap to his defence. Although it is true that the hon. Gentleman believes that, in England, it is perfectly all right for honest people to pay surcharges, he does not believe that that applies to honest people in Scotland. It is unfair of my hon. Friend to say that the hon. Gentleman believes that that is all right in general because he does not believe that it applies in Scotland. I want that to be on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has probably not paid much attention to the Scottish parts of the Bill and may not have looked at the terms of amendment No. 303. My hon. Friend will confirm when he moves that amendment that he is making a separate point about carrying over losses from the community charge to the council tax, which has a different significance from the proposition in the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding. I am astonished that Conservative Members cannot see that. Conservative Members sometimes suffer from voluntary blindness—with all respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have established for the record and for the wider public and local government that the problems of collection are the fault of the Government and not of local authorities, I shall conclude my remarks in the hope that the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding will not see
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0431">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>745</span>
fit to press his amendment. I have the feeling that he might be advised by his hon. Friends on the Front Bench not to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not take 41 minutes. At the end of my speech, I shall refer to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett) on balances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has mainly dealt with amendment No. 232, which seeks to have arrears of collection taken into account for capping. Disingenuous comparisons were made by the hon. Member for Battersea (Mr. Bowis). He compared Hackney and Gateshead and when my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside pointed out the vast difference in turnover because people change addresses in Hackney more frequently than people in Gateshead, he rapidly changed the comparison to Kensington and Hackney. That is not a proper comparison either. It is like comparing Harrods to Mohammed Ali's corner shop in Hackney. He should not compare Kensington, with its wealthy areas, with Hackney, which is one of the poorest areas in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key point is that for arrears and problems of collection, the real correlation is with people's ability to pay, with the level of unemployment, with poverty and low income. Those matters have been studiously avoided by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) and his colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bowis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point is not related to people's ability to pay, nor was the point made by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). He said that the tax is more difficult to collect if there is a high turnover of local residents. I said that as far as I am aware the highest turnover of local residents in London is in the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea. If that authority can collect 105 per cent. given that difficulty, so can other London boroughs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman did not compare Kensington with Gateshead. His first comparison was that of Hackney with Gateshead, which was ruled out because of the turnover argument. He then made another comparison which should be ruled out because it ignores people's ability to pay, which is crucial to collection rates. The real correlation is with rates of unemployment and with low pay and poverty in those areas. Those aspects have been ignored.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Janman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Thurrock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: While there are areas of high deprivation, especially in the north of the borough of Kensington, it is fair to say that the overall level of poverty is greater in Hackney. That is why the SSA for the receiving authority of Kensington and Chelsea for the next financial year is £157·249 million, whereas the figure for Hackney is £293·518 million. The calculation of SSAs takes into account the hon. Gentleman's contention, and I cannot understand why he has spent all day trying to pick holes in what is clearly a sensible and perfect working approach to the problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>7.15 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I were to spend any more time on SSAs, which have already had a good innings, you would rule me
	<span class='label label-info column'>746</span>
out of order, Sir Michael. I have worked for Hackney council and anyone who has lived or worked in that area knows the depth of poverty there. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that that poverty is dealt with by the SSA figures that he quoted, he has got another think coming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since a great deal of attention has been paid to the comparison between the boroughs of Hackney and Kensington and Chelsea, my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton (Mr. Cohen) may care to note that the leader of Tory-controlled Kensington and Chelsea, Mrs. Iain Hanham, has a great deal more accuracy—I was tempted to say honesty—in her perception of the problems than Conservative Members. Mrs. Hanham, as a member of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities policy committee, supported the request that the Government should finance an advertising campaign to improve poll tax collection. At least she recognised the truth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point, and of course the Government will not put up the money for such a campaign. Right at the beginning of the poll tax regime I put down a parliamentary question asking how much the Government would include in local authorities' grant settlements for bad debt provision. I also asked how much they suggested local authorities should set aside for bad debt. Bad debts existed under the rating system and everyone knew that that problem would be much bigger under the poll tax, which was targeted so that the rich paid less and the poor paid more. The answer to both questions was, in effect, "Not a penny". That response helped to create the surcharge problem, in which people's arrears are added to the charges that others have to pay. The Government have not made any provision for bad debts, so there is only one place for those debts to go—into other payers' bills. That is the Government's fault, first because they sent bills to people who could not pay in the first place and secondly because they did not provide a bad debt provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gould</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government, having created this dreadful predicament, are now advised by the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding to penalise those who have paid their poll tax, not by requiring them to pay a surcharge but by forcing them to accept a further cut in services that have already been damaged by the capping process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the key point. At the end of the day what is the result of these penalising, Conservative measures? It is that the services in those areas are cut yet again. The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding admitted in his speech that that would be the result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let us examine the implications of the proposal of the hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding for central Government. He has not put forward a proposal for central Government on the non-payment of various taxes. That about PAYE and national insurance contributions? What about vehicle excise duty? Only about 90 per cent. of cars and about 80 to 85 per cent. of motor cycles are taxed. There are no suggestions that the Government should make allowances for that. We know that much VAT is not collected and that the success rate for collecting TV licences is about 90 per cent. Why has not the hon. Gentleman said that people's tax bills should include an acknowledgement that as authorities have been unable to collect an element of tax, people must pay for the Government's failure to pursue collection?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1991-1992V001P0I0432">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>747</span>
The Government have spent £14 billion trying to clear up the mess of the poll tax. It should be stated on income tax bills that the money to pay for the problems of the poll tax has been added to those bills. The hon. Member for Stamford and Spalding is saying that the council tax will make local authorities pay more for non-collection and so have to cut services. However, the Government will not cut the budget of the Ministry of Defence, for example, because of the non-collection of VAT. The hon. Gentleman wants to impose on local authorities a different regime. He made much of the idea that Opposition Members did not counter his argument. My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) countered it well. The comparison with the national aspect shows the flaws in the hon. Gentleman's case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to return to the points about balances made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside. The case was reported yesterday of Shell being fined £100,000 because of a leak of butane gas. Only a thin strip of metal prevented an explosion that would have killed 400 people. Hon. Members might wonder about the relevance of that to our debate, but if there had been an explosion killing 400 people, the council responsible for Ellesmere Port, Cheshire would have had to spend an enormous amount from its balances to clear up the devastation. Moreover, under the Government's proposals, when it tried to make up its balances, it would have been capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alistair Burt
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Bury, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman think that even this Government would consider the circumstances of an accident in which 400 people lost their lives an emergency matter and so make available extra funds, as has happened in the past?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course that would be the case, but I must remind the hon. Gentleman of the Bellwin proposals following the hurricane of 1987. Those proposals required local authorities to use their contingency funds and there was a huge argument afterwards about whether they were properly reimbursed. Many authorities, such as mine, maintain to this day that they were not properly reimbursed for the amounts that they spent. Under the proposed arrangement, they would have to replenish their balances the following year and could face being capped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well remember when I was a new Member in the House and the time when the then Secretary of State for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), made a statement and Conservative Member after Conservative Member went through the roof about the consequences for their local authorities. Local authorities would have to find hundreds of thousands of pounds from tax payers as a result of the Bellwin settlement. If that was the position then, it would be even worse under the hon. Gentleman's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Ms. Primarolo) whispered in my ear to remind me that the hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West (Sir A. Meyer) had enormous problems with the Government when a sea wall in his constituency proved to be inadequate and the area was flooded. The local authority had to spend a great deal of money from its contingency fund.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>748</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Bennett</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in Clwyd on Friday and spoke to local authority officials. The Welsh Ofice offered £2 million but the authority needed only £400,000 to tackle the problem of the flood.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Clwyd, North-West had to stand against the then Prime Minister, the right hon. Member for Finchley, (Mrs. Thatcher), in a leadership election so that he could get the money. The point remains that it has taken several years to sort out. In the meantime, that local authority could be capped because it has used part of its contingency fund while waiting for the Government to fork out. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside is still relevant and the Minister should deal with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a case for saying that only expenditure planned for a particular year should count for the purpose of capping. How can balances—a form of savings—be put into an equation for capping purposes that is about spending? In other respects the Government are on record as supporting savings. I do not like capping exercises anyway, but there is certainly no justification for including balances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may argue that to exclude balances would provide a loophole, but there is a provision to cover that possibility. Councils are obliged to set a balanced budget. Their district auditors could intervene and quash a budget if it was not valid because it did not balance. The director of finance and the district auditor have a duty to ensure that a council does not overspend in any one year. They can even stop new contracts. They have the necessary power. Local authorities cannot simply increase their balances without limits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Janman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is discussing the merits of overspending and the problems of capping. Does he agree that, had tighter capping regulations been in force in 1987, the then Labour Member for Walthamstow would probably not have lost his seat?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Cohen</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: After the next general election there will be another Labour Member for Walthamstow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Councils simply cannot raise their balances without limits: provisions implicit in clauses 32(7) and 43(6) would stop that. If it is argued that a loophole would allow local authorities to spend balances so balances should be included when capping, that is wrong. We should consider only the spending in any one year rather than the money that flows in and out of the balance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Government are not satisfied with those two proposals, there is a third option. An agreement could be reached with the external auditor on the extent to which an authority could overstate the balances. The figure would be financially prudent if it were assessed by an external auditor. That would ensure that local authorities do not harbour resources simply for the sake of doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
