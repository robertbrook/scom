	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Eric Pickles 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Brentwood and Ongar)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Winterton. I shall not disguise my anger at what I believe will prove to be a waste of our time. Today, the Prime Minister announced a new agency that will combine functions of the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Social Security that relate directly and exactly to matters covered by the statutory instruments that we are to debate: work-focused interviews and contracting out. I draw the attention of any Labour Member of the Committee who doubts my words to the terms of the draft order and a letter from the Library. The letter states:
	<br><blockquote><p>The order relates only to functions connected with the ONE service: it does not cover any other social security functions, such as those related to the determination of … benefits.</p></blockquote>
However, in today's reply to a written question tabled by the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Bradley), the Prime Minister said that the new agency
	<br><blockquote><p>will deliver a single, integrated service to benefit claimants of working age and to employers.</p></blockquote>
I know, Mr. Winterton, that you are a guardian of Back Benchers. I should point out that I did not receive this letter from either Department or from the Library; I had to borrow it from a member of the Lobby—a journalist. Hon. Members, and members of this Committee in particular, should have been the first to receive that information. We are about to discuss two statutory instruments that will be torn up before the ink has dried on them. The only solution is for the Minister of State to withdraw the orders, or for you to exercise your discretion and withdraw them, so that they can be amended accordingly. Otherwise, we shall be wasting our time this afternoon.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Fabricant 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lichfield)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Winterton. Given that a very important debate is taking place in the House on the future of Rover, and in light of changes that have been leaked to the press and authenticated in various letters to hon. Members that have yet to be made public, it is extraordinary that no indication has been given of how long the two statutory instruments will be in operation. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. Pickles) has a strong point, in that it would be a waste of our time to debate the orders for 90 minutes, only to discover that they were shortly to be repealed. It is a gross discourtesy, not only to the House but the Committee, that such
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
information has first been leaked to the press and dealt with in letters to some hon. Members and not others' but has not yet formally been put into in the public domain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities wish to catch my eye?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Ms Tessa Jowell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to those points during the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar has raised what any Committee member would consider a very important matter, I must tell him and the hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant) that it is a matter for debate, not for me. As Chairman, I act in accordance with precedent and the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, and I must rule that the matter is indeed a bona fide, genuine matter for debate. I can only express the hope that the Minister of State has heard what has been said and that she will deal in her speech with the matters of deep concern that have been raised by Opposition Members. No doubt the Minister—I see that a member of the Government Whips' Office is also present—will ensure that the Government are made aware of the concerns expressed by Her Majesty's Opposition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.35 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities (Ms Tessa Jowell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Contracting Out (Functions Relating to Social Security) Order 2000.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider the draft Social Security (Work-focused Interviews) Regulations 2000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Winterton. It is a pleasure to meet under your traditionally fair Chairmanship. I intend to open the debate and my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle), will wind up. That arrangement provides clear evidence of the cross-departmental way in which the proposals have been developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall begin by dealing with the Opposition's fair questions, because the timing of the debate and the Prime Minister's announcement need to be explained. I shall deal with that before coming to the substance of the matters before the Committee. First, I hope that all members of the Committee accept that today's debate was set without regard to the scheduled announcement. Secondly, the Prime Minister's announcement has much broader relevance than the regulations. The regulations will take effect only until 2002; at that time, we shall decide whether, in the light of experience, to roll them out and generalise the method of access to advice and information on welfare benefits and searching for a job. I assure Opposition Members that the order and the schedules apply specifically to the 12 pilot areas in which the ONE models are currently operating.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No one would suggest that the Minister contrived that the debate should happen today. However, does she not recognise the concern among hon. Members on both sides of the House that the Prime Minister's announcement was not made in the House, but was leaked from Downing street and given first to the press?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is not the case. The Prime Minister's statement was delivered to the House by way of a parliamentary answer, which was timed for 12.30 pm today. However, I know that speculative reports were carried in the morning news bulletins and I put it on the record that that is cause for great regret.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interests of the 80,000 staff involved and of the many more members of the public who are affected by the orders, enormous care was taken with the announcement. The information should not have been leaked, but should have been delivered in an orderly manner. I pay tribute to the chief executives of the Employment Service and the Benefits Agency and to senior staff in the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Social Security; they have done an admirable and professional job in developing the proposals and in making sure they were communicated to staff at the proper time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for expressing her regret. However, she said that the information was leaked to the press and that the press made speculative comments about it this morning. Can the right hon. Lady at least confirm that her Department and the Department of Social Security were not the source of the leaks, and, if they were not, will she say whether those leaks could have come from Downing street—or even from Alastair Campbell?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all know that it is a characteristic of government that announcements are sometimes preempted in unexpected ways. Let me make it absolutely clear to the Committee that the Department of Social Security and the Department for Education and Employment had a clear strategy of communication with staff about the decision and about the Prime Minister's announcement. That information was properly and systematically communicated to staff and it is a process of which those who were charged with that responsibility can be proud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue the matter of who leaked what other than to say that I am dissatisfied. I want to pursue another matter instead. The right hon. Lady said that the order relates only to the pilot areas, but that is not true. She may have forgotten that the provisions, particularly with regard to the contracting out functions, are not restricted to the pilot areas, but can be used more generally by private and voluntary sector providers involved in the expansion of the ONE scheme in other parts of the country. Perhaps the Minister will qualify her statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about the regulations that set out the requirements for the work-focused interviews. The contracting-out order extends beyond the pilot schemes and will not be replaced, but it will allow a decision about participation in interviews to be taken by those authorised under the contracting-out
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
order to exercise the function, if and when the model ONE goes national.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Prime Minister announced earlier today the Government's plans to establish a new agency for working age people. I hope that I have made clear the distinction between that announcement, which is obviously a matter of interest to members of the Committee, and the regulations before us. The new agency will draw together the functions currently carried out by the Employment Service and the Benefits Agency. It will provide a framework that is purpose built for the delivery of our welfare-to-work initiatives, and it will directly support our objective of helping more people of working age who are able to work to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want work for those who can work and security for those who cannot. We want a modern work-focused delivery system that can develop and deliver its own culture, objectives and values based on the clear recognition of rights and responsibilities. It is our clear intention that the new agency, which will bring together the Employment Service and the parts of the Benefits Agency that relate to people of working age, will be more than the sum of its parts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady will know that the new approach is based on a model currently in use the United States of America. Does she believe that that model has been effective in ensuring that the poorest and weakest in society are protected? She will be aware of the huge gaps between rich and poor in the United States, and I do not have to remind her that in Britain, to our surprise, the gaps between rich and poor have widened over the past two and a half years. What makes her think that the model that has increased such disparity in the United States will decrease it in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, the new agency is not based on an American model. We can learn from the ways in which American states deliver welfare-to-work programmes; we should incorporate some aspects of their approach and reject others. Before Christmas, I visited a number of states to see a range of welfare-to-work programmes in action. Secondly, and more important, we must build on experience and on what the ONE pilots teach us. What matters is that we develop an approach to welfare to work that fits people's expectations and is clearly rooted on an equal balance between individual responsibility and the Government's obligation to provide the necessary help, advice and support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are building on what we started with the introduction of the new deal, the working families tax credit and the national minimum wage, which are all part of making work pay. The hon. Member for Lichfield referred to the gap between rich and poor, but if he examines the data, he will find that although conclusions such as those to which he referred are being reported now, they refer to years when the Conservative Government were in power. We have learnt from America the importance of making work pay, especially through access to in-work tax credits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Already, almost 264,000 people have found work as a result of the welfare-to-work initiatives. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0216">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
regulations are part of the next step in our welfare reform programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make progress. I shall be happy to allow interventions later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations support the plans to introduce a single point of entry or gateway into the benefits system. That gateway will focus both on work and on supporting people who can work in returning to the labour market. That is why we are bringing together the Employment Service, the Benefits Agency and local authorities to provide a streamlined service that gives claimants one point of contact for all their benefits needs. That is known as ONE and the model is currently being piloted in the 12 areas covered by the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The prime purpose of the regulations is to make it a requirement for the receipt of benefit for all working-age claimants living in the pilot areas who make new claims to benefits to take part in a work-focused interview. Interviews will usually take place as part of the claims process, although there will be discretion to waive or defer the requirement if that is justified by the circumstances of an individual case. That point was well aired during the passage of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999. There will also be provision for repeat interviews, which will be triggered by prescribed events such as the receipt of a personal capacity assessment or the continuous receipt of benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ONE pilots have been running in four areas since June. A further eight pilots, testing call-centre technology and four are led by private and voluntary sector consortiums, started in November. They are already beginning to show possible benefits in helping people to plan a route from benefit to work. They have been well received by people who claim benefit, who have welcomed the streamlined service, the personal approach and the single point of access. For example, a woman attended a start-up at Leamington Spa to inquire about claiming income support because her husband had just left her. She was going to give up her part-time job at a local school and move on to benefit. However, at the critical time, she saw a personal adviser who calculated that she could claim family credit and be much better off than she would be on income support. Fast family credit was applied for, and she remained in work rather than claiming benefit. That would not have happened under the old system. Her claim would have been accepted, and she might have remained on benefit for years. That is a personal example of why we strongly support this approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Participation in interviews has not been obligatory until now, but the number of people who have volunteered has been encouraging. Some 64 per cent. of lone parents and 54 per cent. of sick and disabled people have agreed to take part in work-focused interviews. Although the figures are encouraging, they emphasise why we need the regulations. More than 44 per cent. of those offered an interview are not taking up the option. We are therefore not able to advise
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
them of the benefits of participation, and they do not have access to the help and support that is available. They might remain on benefit when, with appropriate help, they could get into work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions will not require lone parents or disabled people to take a job or undergo training. Steps that they take beyond attendance at an interview are voluntary. They have a choice. However, the mandatory interview ensures that that is an informed choice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned informed choice. Does she agree that the citizens advice bureau has a valuable role to play? What contact is her Department making with the CABs in the pilot areas to ensure that they are fully briefed about what benefits are available and what impact the regulations will have on people in those areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting question. It gives me an opportunity to pay tribute to the invaluable work of the CABs. All Members of Parliament recognise the benefits that CABs provide to our constituents. At a local level, I have been impressed by the ONE pilot sites that I have visited and by the range of contacts that they have established. I hope that the CABs in the areas where there are ONE pilots will be well apprised of the ONE service and will encourage people to use it. People often use the CAB because of the failings of the existing system. It would be interesting to have CABs' views on how their work load has changed as a result of this single point of entry to the benefits and job search service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are 17 regulations and I am sure the Committee does not want me to go through each in great detail, but it may be of assistance to highlight some of the key provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 4 provides for someone of working age who lives in a pilot area and wishes to claim one or more of the specified benefits to take part in a work-focused interview. The benefits to which this provision applies are those specified in section 2A of the Social Security Administration Act 1992: income support, incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance, invalid care allowance, widows' and bereavement benefit, housing benefit and council tax benefit. A personal advisor will be appointed and the interview will take place in a ONE office or elsewhere as appropriate. Claimants under the age of 18 will have a personal advisor, but the requirement to take part in a work-focused interview will be modified for them. Their interviews will be with an officer of the careers service and will focus principally on training and educational opportunities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 5 identifies those who claim a prescribed benefit, but who will be exempt from the requirement to take part in a work-focused interview. Some of the prescribed benefits—for example, widows' benefit and housing benefit—can be claimed by people who are already in work. For them, a work-focused interview would not be necessary, so they will be exempt. People who are claiming or are entitled to a jobseeker's allowance are required to undertake work-related activity as one of the conditions for receiving that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0217">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
benefit. The provisions therefore are not appropriate for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, people who are not habitually resident in Great Britain are excluded for obvious practical reasons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister raises an interesting point. Has she considered that this may constitute a loophole and therefore provide an opening for fraud? Might people move around in order to avoid these compulsory interviews? What consideration has the Minister given to that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to be clear. If they are not habitually resident in Great Britain, they are not eligible for benefit and therefore the issue of fraud would not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 6 deals with repeat interviews. It provides that, in order to continue receiving full benefit, claimants may be required to take part in a work-focused interview at specified points throughout the lifetime of their benefit claim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulations 7 and 8 are important provisions in that they allow for the requirement to take part in an interview to be waived or deferred. The requirement may be waived if an interview would be of no assistance to the claimant or would not be appropriate in the circumstances of the case. It may be deferred if it would be neither appropriate nor of assistance at that particular time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that specific point, who determines whether or not to defer the interview?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That decision would be made by the personal adviser. The hon. Gentleman is no doubt aware that personal advisers have received, are receiving and will continue to receive careful training in making these decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 11 sets out what a client must do to satisfy the requirement that he take part in the interview. He must attend at the appointed time and place and must answer questions related to his employment prospects when asked. These questions will cover the following areas: educational qualifications, employment history, any vocational training undertaken, skills acquired, any paid or unpaid work he has engaged in and any medical condition that he or she considers puts him or her at a disadvantage in gaining employment; and any caring or child care responsibilities. As I said earlier, that does not put any requirement on the claimant to take work following the interview.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 12 sets out the consequences of failing to take part without good cause. In a new claim in which the requirement to take part in an interview has not been deferred, the client will be treated as not having made a claim, so benefit will not be awarded. In a new claim in which the interview has been deferred and benefit has been paid, benefit will be terminated. In cases in which a claimant fails to take part in a repeat interview under regulation, benefit will be reduced by an amount equivalent to 20 per cent. of the income support personal allowance for someone over 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Claimants will be encouraged to take part at all stages and will have numerous opportunities to do so. If, during an interview, claimants appear not to be taking part, the personal adviser will make it clear to them that their inaction might prejudice their entitlement to benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 14 provides a non-exhaustive list of matters to be taken into account in considering good cause for failure to take part in an interview, including misunderstanding the requirement to take part as a result of language, literacy, learning difficulties or official misdirection; a pre-arranged medical or dental appointment that could not be rearranged; difficulties with normal transport; established customs and practices of someone's religion preventing them from attending interview; seeking work; an accident; sudden illness or relapse; attendance at the funeral of a close friend or relative; or a disability preventing someone from attending interview.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Notwithstanding the fact that our Whips Offices often receive similar excuses for not attending Votes, the operation seems labour intensive. What additional resources are being given to offices to ensure that people are available to conduct such interviews?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The total cost of the ONE pilots is budgeted at £127 million, of which £80 million is new money. The invest to save budget also provides money.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way? She appears to be in no hurry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to achieve a balance between my opening remarks and giving hon. Members an opportunity to contribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister reached a conclusion on whether a personal adviser's optimum case load should exceed 30 cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have given that a lot of consideration, as I have the need to create a career structure for personal advisers, whom evaluation has shown to be the key to the success of the new deal for young people. Such highly gifted people need to combine training with experience and should have a properly balanced case load.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, case loads vary between 40 and 90 cases. I would allow local discretion to determine the size of case loads. We would expect more experienced personal advisers to handle more complex cases. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that I shall keep case load sizes under close review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Regulation 15 provides a right of appeal against a decision that a person has failed to take part without good cause, whether as originally made or revised. All decisions taken by delegated authorities will be treated as decisions of the Secretary of State and will be heard by the independent Appeals Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me briefly move on to the contracting out order. Private and voluntary sector organisations are leading the delivery of the ONE service in four of the 12 pilot areas. They are Deloitte Consulting in Suffolk and Leeds, Reed/Shaw Trust in, north Nottinghamshire and Action for Employment in North Cheshire. This order is designed to enable employees of those organisations to perform certain functions in relation to work-focused interviews. The order relates only to functions connected with the ONE service: it does not cover any other social security functions, such as those related to the determination of claims to benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the Committee should note that the provisions are not restricted to the pilot areas and could be used more generally if private and voluntary sector providers are to be involved in any expansion of the ONE service to other parts of the country—a point that I dealt with earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 2 of the order allows for specified functions of the Secretary of State to be exercised by those whom he authorises in that behalf. Those authorised to exercise those functions and the extent to which they may be exercised will be detailed in contracts between the Secretary of State and the providers. The functions that may be contracted out are those relating to work-focused interviews, the revision of decisions related to work-focused interviews and certain functions relating to claims for housing benefit and council tax benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that the contractor or his employee may decide, for example, whether a work-focused interview should be waived or deferred, whether a client has taken part in such an interview or whether there was good cause for failure to comply with the requirement. They may also revise or supersede such decisions, for example, where fresh information comes to light. Paragraph 3 makes similar provision in relation to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a full and illuminating exchange about the regulations and the contracting out order, which are an important building block in the Government's programme of welfare reform, moving people who can work from benefit into work. I commend the regulations and the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

considerably later. We could have decided to debate the regulations and the order separately, which would have taken longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for going into such detail. She ended by referring to an illuminating discussion, but you may have seen, Mr. Winterton, that a folder on her desk is entitled "FOG", which probably much better reflects the earlier part of our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any reference to fog is due more to my interest in the weather forecast.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regard that as rather worrying. Nevertheless, Napoleon wanted lucky generals, and the right hon. Lady obviously comes into that category; she has been very lucky today. She said that today's announcement had nothing to do with this debate and, Mr. Winterton, thanks to the kindness and wisdom of your ruling that such matters can be discussed, she was allowed to make the first seven minutes of her speech, which was already typed. Frankly, I do not accept her arguments about timing. She suggested that nobody had the remotest idea that these two statutory instruments would be debated on the day that the Prime Minister made his announcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady says that the pilot schemes will continue until 2002, but it is clear from the Prime Minister's announcement—he makes the point twice—that he wants
	<br><blockquote><p>to establish the agency as soon as possible in 2001.</p></blockquote>
I expect that he wants that to be done in the spring of 2001, for reasons that we need not go into now. She said that these are simply pilot schemes, but the tenor of the Prime Minister's statement is that the proposal will be pushed through the pilot schemes and implemented nationally. Therefore, we must be clear about whether the regulations will be successful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Lady suggests that it is coincidental that she has moved from state to state looking at schemes in the United States of America. Is the terminology of the new deal, ONE and all the other proposals on welfare to work entirely a coincidence? The Committee should not be misled. She says that we shall not accept the American pattern, but the Government have used the same names and similar regulations to those used in America.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Lady shakes her head, but I accept that it is just a terrible coincidence that we shall have to live with. The Under-Secretary of State for Social Security is here. It is nice to see a social security Minister still in post, given that not much of a function is left for that Department; the Contributions Agency has gone, pensions have disappeared, these matters are disappearing and it is pretty obvious that she is second fiddle in the Committee. It do not know whether it would be appropriate, but perhaps after 6 o'clock we could have a whip round to wish the hon. Lady a happy retirement, because, frankly, all that will be left for her to do in the Committee is to turn off the lights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
I should like to hear an explanation of the Prime Minister's statement, in which he says:
	<br><blockquote><p>The new agency will be in the front line of the drive to modernise Government.</p></blockquote>
That is a surprise. He also says:
	<br><blockquote><p>It will have technology to provide the most up-to-date service for more than 10 million customers each year.</p></blockquote>
So it is right that he always says something about technology.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know from other deliberations that, in the Department for Education and Employment, the computers that deal with education cannot talk to those used for employment matters and that the computers in the Department of Social Security cannot talk to those involved in employment or, presumably, education issues. So what sort of system will be set up in just over a year's time? How much money will be invested in it? Are we talking about new computers? Those matters need to be explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will not mind if I say that we are perhaps a little jaundiced about the concept of new money. We are not entirely sure what that phrase means. We are not entirely sure that we will understand what the right hon. Lady means even if she tries to tell us. Obviously, we shall take at face value what she says, but our normal method of looking at new money is to divide it by 10 to get somewhere near the real figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been particularly lucky in debating these measures because a study of their likely effectiveness has been carried out, especially on the new deal for lone parents—the Government's flagship proposal. It is sad that the study was dumped—perhaps I should say deposited—in the Library on a Friday evening, which is the parliamentary equivalent of being summoned to meet at a crossroads at midnight on the darkest night of the year. Nevertheless, we have considered the flagship success and we know that it is modern, radical and a new triumph. The Minister of State—no doubt a master of spin—could surely use the most wonderful language available in the lexicon to demonstrate its success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Was the report used? What did Ministers say about how successful the programme was? They did not say that research showed that the new deal for lone parents was a great triumph, just that it had a small positive effect—that is apparently the slogan to be championed through ONE. However, on page 4, under the heading "Work and benefit history", the report referred to the success in terms of the statistical difference, saying that the differences were so small that they should be treated as insignificant. The obvious corollary of something being statistically insignificant is that the effect could have been a small negative effect on lone parents. We have spent about £190 million that may have made matters slightly better or slightly worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State has produced some figures about success, but we know that 80 per cent. of single parents who found a job through the programme would have done so without any help. The number of lone parents on benefit was only 3.3 per cent. lower in areas with the new deal than in those without it—we
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
know that from the Government's own study. My hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield may care to comment on that shocking fact. In fact, single parents may have been more likely to find work in areas that did not have the new deal than in areas that did. The Government decided to use comparable areas, so that they could have a fair idea of what action would be best, so the result is rather embarrassing. The Government sent half a million letters, and the outcome was about 20,000 new jobs, which works out as a little more than £24,000 a job. That is worrying, given that the Prime Minister is about to expand the resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good when research confirms one's basic prejudice. I have gone round some of the projects and talked to staff, and I am full of admiration for personal advisers. Over a cup of coffee, I chatted with them about their work load. I was staggered when the right hon. Lady said that their case load was about 40 to 90 cases. We know that personal advisers work best when they have a real link with their clients; client must feel that he is not simply a number, so if there is a high case load, the advantages of personal advisers disappear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 3 of the report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>After starting with much larger caseloads, advisers found that at any one time they managed caseloads of between 20 and 30 clients most effectively.</p></blockquote>
That is a long way from the right hon. Lady's reference to case loads of between 40 and 90 cases and it has direct implications for the number of advisers that will be required when we go national. It is no use personal advisers having to deal with 90 to 120 cases—they will be swamped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State should state the number of people who will be required and describe the training programme. Many promises were made in the Standing Committee on the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill. I am sure that the Government Whip would like me to repeat at length the promises that were made about a clear statement setting out the objectives of training—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that you, Mr. Winterton, have long been a champion of widows' rights. On regulation 4, the Department of Social Security's memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>The benefits to which this provision applies are those specified in section 2A of the Administration Act, that is, income support, incapacity benefit, severe disablement allowance, invalid care allowance, widow's and bereavement benefits.</p></blockquote>
It refers also to housing benefit and council tax. However, surely it was a mistake to refer to bereavement allowance, which is to be put into place in only a few days' time? It has already caused great controversy: the Government originally said that it would be paid for six months after death, but the other place extended the provision to 12 months. Surely to goodness, there will not be a requirement to ensure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0220">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
that people in receipt of the allowance take part in a work-focused interview? One of the reasons for extending the period for a further six months was the recognition that the process of bereavement is so dreadful. I remember my mother's death—I was completely thrown by it, and the experience must be even worse if a spouse has died. The last thing that someone would want to do is attend a work-focused interview.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, the order cannot cover widow's allowance, because that would be a taxable benefit. People who receive such benefits could well be in work. The statutory instrument is ridiculous—the Government must have made a mistake. If they have not, they are creating a great injustice. The memorandum refers also to widows' benefit, but that, too, should not be included in the regulations and I shall explain why. On First Reading, in Committee, on Report and on Third Reading of the Bill, the Secretary of State and the Minister of State for Social Security made it clear that existing claimants and beneficiaries of the widow's payment would not be affected by the changes brought in by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accepted that it was the Government's intention to introduce widows' benefits or bereavement benefits. The Government have reneged on a solemn undertaking. I took them at their word, as I suspect that you did, Mr. Winterton. The Government cannot renege on their decision in a Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation that is meeting on a rainy Thursday afternoon—or, at least it looks like it is raining. The Minister of State is the expert on weather, although perhaps she only knows about fog.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know the answers to my questions. I do not care what else the Under-Secretary says in her reply, but she must deal with the question of widows' payments. A mistake might have been made: the benefit is in the memorandum, but that is not immediately clear from the regulations. The regulations will be passed, but I want an undertaking that widows benefit is not being included. Regulation 12(4) lays down a pecking order, in the middle of which is widows benefit, but, surely, no one will take away a taxable pension on such mistaken grounds? I shall not labour the point, but I seek ministerial assurance. On regulation 8, the memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>Personal advisers will consider deferring an interview where, for example, a person is distressed following a recent bereavement.</p></blockquote>
Such bereavement may concern a spouse or family member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Lady allows personal advisers to have a higher case load of 80,90, or 120 cases, that will put a lot of pressure on the advisers. Under the scheme, people are entitled to an hour-long interview, which could involve a lot of strain. We want to ensure that people are not deferred for administrative convenience or to meet a target. People's interviews should not be deferred because personal advisers are overworked: that is undesirable, as it opens up the dreadful prospect of people getting locked in the system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
The provision is pretty wide. The memorandum mentions circumstances
	<br><blockquote><p>which lead to the requirement to attend an interview.</p></blockquote>
As the Minister of State kindly acknowledged, such matters are in the hands of personal advisers, who are their own masters—if I may use a sexist term—in such matters. I shall not read out the briefing from the Child Poverty Action Group that we all received. However, it makes some telling points about ensuring that the regulation is applied reasonably. Regulation 10 deals with where the interview takes place. We must consider the reasonableness of that as personal advisers are in the driving seat in such matters. Regulation 12 deals with a pecking order of benefits. I have said all that I want to say about that, so I shall move on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am keen to get a response from the Under-Secretary on the relationship between the personal capacity assessment and the work-focused interview. Also important is the discussion of any medical condition: medical records are confidential, but in such matters there is a duty of disclosure. That is what makes my earlier questions about training important. What will the training programme have to say about how non-clinicians deal with matters medical? We would like that spelt out.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just finished taking part in a Standing Committee with the Under-Secretary of State for Social Security.

In view of her current plight—her Department is effectively being taken away by a mere tick of the Prime Minister's pen—I feel rather sympathetic towards her today. It cannot be nice for her to go back to her desk tonight with a black bag to clear away her little trinkets—decorative smurfs or whatever she keeps on her desk. I am confident that she will be able to respond. We gave the Government a fair hearing and much co-operation—we even voted on the odd aspects of the bill.

I have not played games today. We were pretty angry. We could have filibustered and been unpleasant. In fact, for one moment I thought that the Minister of State was filibustering. I have made some points that might be regarded as hurtful about the effectiveness of the pilots and I expect some response to those points. I do not mind what the Under-Secretary says, but I do want a response on the widows—my number one priority. She made me a promise and, more importantly, she made a promise to

The Committee is not divided on the general principle that it is far better to have people in work than on benefit. That makes good financial sense and is good for the well-being of the individual. There is far greater satisfaction in the mind of people who work than that in of people who gain benefit from the work of others—taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key question is whether the order and the pilot programmes will be successful. We have heard several examples of the new deal. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar says, there is virtually no difference between people in work in new deal areas and people in work outside the new deal areas. He provided an interesting statistic: 500,000 letters were distributed, which resulted in just 20,000 people working—a response rate of 4 per cent. That is considerably less than the response rate that charities such as Christian Aid get when they write asking for money; 4 per cent. is very low indeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have four specific concerns, the first of which is financial resources. The Minister said on a number of occasions that this is all part of the—I have forgotten which buzzword it was. Was it the invest to spend or the spend to invest scheme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Invest to save.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister, who is shortly to be out of work. I hope that the Prime Minister will note how quickly she came back with a helpful sedentary intervention—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Invest to spin.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my hon. Friend says, it could even be invest to spin. The point is that the Minister knows as well as I do that the Treasury works on a cash flow basis. It has always been thus, unfortunately. There is always a delay between investment and receiving the money back, whether it is business or government. There are a number of things that you and I agree on, Mr. Winterton, but there is one thing in particular. I remember when we went to the Treasury before the last election to ask about capital allowances. We both argued that larger capital allowances enabled businesses to invest, for the very reason that the hon. Lady gave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister, like other Ministers—Treasury rules have not changed in the past few years—said that the delay in getting a return from the extra corporation tax that is being paid was too great. One could argue that the delay would have been quite short—as I believe. The point is that invest to save is a fine slogan but I am
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
not convinced that the resources will be made available. We know that there has been little return on the expenditure on the new deal. All independent studies have shown that virtually the same number of people would have gone into work without the new deal. The investment saved no money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other area of resources that bothers me is personal advisers. We all know that social workers have large work loads. Terrible cases of mistreatment and hardship often slip through the system because social workers are unable to look after their case loads adequately. My hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar said that studies have shown that the optimum case load is 20 to 30. I was pleasantly surprised, and I was not making the point of order for effect, but I genuinely thought that the Minister of State said 14 to 19. I thought that that was a tremendously generous provision for personal advisers. A case load of 40 to 90 seems incredibly large for a personal adviser to work on, and I do not see how it is possible. If the interview lasts for an hour and there is a plan to interview 90 people in a week, even without allowing for lunch breaks, comfort breaks and so on, that is a good 90-hour week. Are they being paid the minimum working wage for that? The Minister must not shy away from that important question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second concern is about computers and the ability of one Department to talk to another. I must correct my hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar: software—not computers—causes the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For a long time, many people have argued that the Inland Revenue and the Department of Social Security should speak to one another, but negative tax credits have always caused a problem. Such credits have worked in the United States, which does not have tax based on a pay-as-you-earn system. I am not convinced that the Government can get anything right in relation to computer software. One need only examine the performance of the Passport Agency to see what I mean.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I completed my legal studies way back in 1973. However, even I can spot half a dozen major loopholes in the regulations that could be exploited by anyone not wanting to attend an interview. Examining the good causes listed in regulation 14, for example, one finds that paragraph (h) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>he was attending the funeral of a close friend or relative on the day fixed for the interview.</p></blockquote>
That is almost the oldest excuse in the book, analogous to "the cheque is in the post" or—I shall not continue, as it would be sexist to use the example that I had in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regulation 14 requires careful examination. I am sure that anyone with the slightest inventive ability could come up with an excuse for not attending an interview that would be covered by regulation 14. I therefore seek an assurance that new money will be available and that announcements about such money will not be made again and again. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food made such an announcement recently, when he said that there was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0222">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
£600 million of new money to help farmers. After close questioning, it turned out that only £36 million was available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Under-Secretary accepts that having 40 to 90 people in a personal adviser's case load is far too high. Will she address the problem of computers and make the order and the regulations workable? At the moment, sadly, as good as they are intended to be, they are not workable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security (Angela Eagle)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do my best to deal with the points that have been raised in the limited time that is left. If time runs out, I am happy to deal with outstanding matters in correspondence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statutory instruments represent another step in the reform of the welfare state. Today's announcement from the Prime Minister about the creation of a working age agency represents a gigantic step in the same direction. Such reform will revolutionise how we deal with people of working age, and will assist in the delivery of ONE nationwide, should we move from the 12 pilots that are being tested in various parts of the country to a nationwide programme. The existence of a working age agency would provide a structure enabling us to do that. I must emphasise, however, that no such decision has yet been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two statutory instruments relate solely to the 12 pilot areas in which ONE operates.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary's comments are incomprehensible. The Prime Minister announced that the Department of Social Security, the Benefits Agency and the Department for Education and Employment are coming together in the new unit. What on earth is that if not an extension of ONE? The Prime Minister and the Department of Social Security both imply that. The Under-Secretary cannot say that a decision has not been taken, as the Prime Minister and her boss suggest otherwise. Why can she not accept reality?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to explain the reality to the hon. Gentleman. Sometimes he has difficulty with that concept, but at other times he sees with astonishing clarity. One can never tell which will prevail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ONE pilots are being piloted in 12 different areas, and the regulations refer only to those 12 pilot areas. The creation of a working age agency involves merging the Employment Service with the relevant parts of the Benefits Agency, which will give an holistic, personalised service to unemployed people and to employers who need people to fill vacancies. That approach is a step forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of the new working age agency does not suggest that we have decided whether the ONE pilots should be extended nationwide, but it will provide a mechanism with which we could extend the pilots if we decided to do so after studying the evaluations. Despite the hon. Gentleman's incredulity, that is the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman discussed the new deal for lone parents and quoted selectively from an assessment that
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
was reported in 
	<i>The Daily Telegraph</i> today and in other newspapers. The assessment states that the 20 per cent. of jobs that were gained after participating in the new deal for lone parents were additional to those that would have been gained in the absence of the new deal. There was a positive effect—the relevant figure is 3.3 per cent.—compared with evaluation areas in which the new deal was not available. That work was done during the pilot stage of the new deal for lone parents, and that is where the figures come from. The 20 per cent. figure for additional jobs is better than that which was achieved by GAIN in California or by JET in Australia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition's claim that each job cost the Government £24,248 is a gross exaggeration. The evaluation concluded that the cost per lone parent who joined the scheme was £645, and that the cost per participant who moved into work was not £24,000 but £1,388, which is equivalent to about 10 weeks on benefit. If participation in the new deal for lone parents means that a lone parent moves into work and stays there for more than 10 weeks, the new deal will have paid for itself. If there were 23 per cent. rather than 20 per cent. additional jobs, the entire new deal pilot would have paid for itself in saved benefit, which would be a good result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is obviously an expert on fantasy. She can write to me on this matter, or speak on it from the Dispatch Box or in Committee, and she can do what she wants with those figures, but during the remaining 10 minutes of our debate, will she tell me about widows? She can ignore or write to me about any other matter that I have raised, but I want to know about the widows.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does not like to hear the truth. I was responding to one of his earlier questions—[
	<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman should calm down—I shall discuss the widows soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Personal advisers will receive adequate training. In the ONE pilots, we can test the best way to deal with new clients. All staff are undergoing training to prepare for the new changes that will be introduced in April contained in the regulations. Advisers will work towards national vocational qualifications level 3 in guidance, and they will be trained to deal with the needs of special client groups, including the disabled, people with mental illness, lone parents and people who have been away from the labour market for a long time. All advisers will undergo disability awareness training. That has been sorted out in conjunction with interested parties and groups that represent such clients. We are not inventing the training ourselves—we are consulting appropriate groups to establish the best training methods. Scope, Mencap, MIND, the Carers National Organisation and the National Schizophrenia Fellowship have helped to develop a training package. I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman need hold his breath no longer—I shall discuss widows. During the passage of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999, we said that the relevant provisions would apply only to new claims that were made after 3 April 2000. His worries are completely and utterly unfounded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why do the regulations refer to widows benefits?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because after 3 April 2000 people making claims for the benefits will be required to have an interview, but those who are already widows or who are on such benefits before that date will not. The regulations have to encompass all of the working-age benefits, but they will not apply to people who received those benefits prior to the set date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the terminology has changed. We are talking about bereavement benefit—how does that relate to a widows' benefit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept the assurances that I have given to the Committee. Bereavement benefit will extend the new categories of claimants under the Act. If there is any confusion about widow's benefits and bereavement benefits, I shall clear up the issue in a letter to the hon. Gentleman, but the reassurance that I have given him is absolutely cast iron. I should like to make progress on other issues. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman any more reassurance than saying that all of his fears are unfounded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady has satisfied me and I take her word completely. However, will she ensure that the message goes all the way down and is clearly understood in the Department of Social Security? If she does so, I shall picket her Department to prevent her from being thrown out when it is closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are refocusing the Department on client groups: children, people of working age and pensioners. Announcements have been made about that shift of focus and about the changes to the Department's management structure, which I hope will enable us to ensure with more confidence that we can deliver our aims. The importance of proper notification has been demonstrated in the past, and decisions made in the House—in this week of all weeks—will be put into effect properly. The major managerial and organisational changes that are being made should make the Department far more capable of delivering on those matters, about which we all care so much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Case loads were mentioned. We are undertaking the ONE pilots, and the main meat of the regulations focuses on the regime that we are trying out in the 12 pilot ONE areas. We have made no assumptions and set no targets on case loads during the pilot phase. Piloting is about the development of the new personal adviser role. We have some experience of that role in the new deal, where it has been successful—indeed, it has been one of the most successful aspects of the scheme, both for clients who enter the new deal gateway, and for the job satisfaction and motivation of people in that important role. We are in the middle of developing the extension of the role into the ONE pilot areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Minister come across any development phase evidence suggesting that personal advisers are made more effective by having a case load of more than 50?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is too early for me to draw any conclusion. It is no good setting up a pilot phase and then forming opinions ahead of the results of the evaluation, which we will make freely available. I could air an opinion now, but the pilots are in place so that we can learn from practical experience. We have some experience in the new deals, but they are different from the ONE gateways. We also have experience of how the JSA regime works, but that differs from the way in which we are treating those who want to claim income support or incapacity benefit who are entering into the ONE process in the pilot areas. We may all have opinions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is yours?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My opinion is not relevant until after we have evaluated the pilot schemes. It is interesting that the hon. Member for Lichfield should opine that we do not have enough money to make a major investment in the delivery of more proactive and invidualised help from the welfare state, and then opine that case loads should be set at 14 rather than 40, which would be more expensive. The hon. Gentleman should decide whether he wants a more expensive system, with more money being put into the welfare state, or a cheaper system. He did not seem to be able to make up his mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fabricant</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary totally misinterprets me. I was saying that if a job is to be done properly, the money must be available. I was simply asking what money will be made available, because so little money has been made available in the past. The Government are being particularly stringent at a time of great economic wealth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Angela Eagle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has noticed what a fine economic legacy we are delivering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of computers, we inherited an absolutely disgraceful legacy from the previous Government. That makes it difficult to achieve the seamless high-tech delivery that we want to achieve, and the new services that we want to introduce into the welfare system. That legacy will take time to overcome. We cannot re-equip the whole welfare system overnight, as the hon. Gentleman knows. Information technology places constraints on us initially, but we are procuring the first set of new generation computers for the welfare system, which will make it much easier to integrate some services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with most of the questions that have been raised. I shall write to hon. Members if I have missed anything, but given that and the reassurances that I have given on widows, I commend the order and the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Pickles</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the remaining minute or two, I can tell the Under-Secretary that she has answered the various points that we raised, and that she does not need to write to me about anything except widows. I want to see the word "widow" expunged: the benefit should be called bereavement benefit—a phrase that can be understood. I want an explanation of its three elements. If something is going to exist for only one year, Parliament should be determined to make bereaved people's lives better in that year. The short
