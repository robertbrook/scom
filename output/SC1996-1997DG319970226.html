	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment (Mr. Eric Forth)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Draft Jobseeker's Allowance (Workskill Courses) Pilot Regulations 1997.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to consider
	<br><blockquote><p>The Draft Jobseeker's Allowance (Project Work Pilot Scheme) Regulations 1997, The Draft Jobseeker's Allowance (Project Work Pilot Scheme) (No. 2) Regulations 1997, The Draft Social Security (Jobseeker's Allowance and Mariners' Benefits) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1997 and The Draft Jobseeker's Allowance (Contract for Work) Pilot Regulations 1997.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Jobseeker's Act 1995 provides for pilots of new approaches to helping unemployed people into work to be established through regulations. The purpose of my being here today is to seek the Committee's approval to introduce new pilot schemes that would allow us to evaluate some innovative approaches to helping unemployed people into work. I am also seeking agreement to some minor amendments to jobseeker's allowance regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, on the draft Jobseeker's Allowance (Workskill Courses) Pilot Regulations 1997, during the passage of the Jobseeker's Bill, we made two commitments. First, we said that we would collect information about the effect of the JSA rules on education and training. We have met that commitment and research reports will be published shortly. Secondly, we said that we would consider piloting different arrangements. We have now met that commitment, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is speaking at immense speed. I am interested in listening to the debate, so may I suggest that he changes down just one gear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall, of course, comply with your instructions, Mr. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations would allow us to introduce the pilots to which I referred. They will be called workskill pilots and will allow us to evaluate new, more flexible, arrangements for people who have been receiving JSA for six months or more, which will enable them to undertake employment-related
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
We aim to introduce the pilots, of which there will be two versions, in April 1997. One scheme will be operated in Liverpool and Leeds. It will allow people to undertake certain part-time courses of up to a year and to be available for and looking for part-time work, which can be fitted around their course. The other pilot scheme will be run in Cardiff, Wolverhampton and Walsall. It will allow people to undertake certain full-time courses of up to a year and excuse them from the normal JSA rules on availability for work and looking for work while they attend the course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall turn now to the draft Jobseeker's Allowance (Project Work Pilot Scheme) Regulations. Such pilot schemes will provide an intensive period of jobsearch help and, for people who need it, a period of mandatory work experience. In April last year, the House approved the Jobseeker's Allowance (Pilot Scheme) 1996 Regulations. Since then, we have been running two project work pilots in Hull, Medway and Maidstone, the results of which have been encouraging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations before the Committee would establish two new pilot schemes. One would provide for an expansion of the project work approach to 28 new areas, starting between February and May this year. The other would replace the current pilots in Hull, Medway and Maidstone with a further scheme that would continue to run alongside the pilots in the new areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want also to test some variations on the model used in Hull, Medway and Maidstone, to see if we can improve its effectiveness. An emphasis will be placed on literacy and numeracy help in all the new pilots and, in some of them, we shall be testing intensive and additional literacy and numeracy support. In some pilots, we want to test whether experience in a real workplace improves chances of getting a job through increasing the involvement of the private sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish now to say a few words about the Jobseeker's Allowance (Contract for Work) Pilot Regulations. We are seeking powers to run four contract-for-work pilots—two private sector and two Employment Service pilots—each of which would cover 3,000 people, making 12,000 people in all. The contract-for-work pilots will run in Manchester, London, Glasgow and Birmingham. In the areas in which they are run, they will cover all those who have been unemployed for two years or more. They will start in June and last for 12 months. The participants will be referred to the pilots for six months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Participants who leave the pilot before completing six months, but who return to claim JSA during the life of the pilot will be referred back to it for the balance of the six months remaining. The pilots will be mandatory: participants will be liable to benefit sanction for misconduct or non-attendance. Pilot participants will receive JSA, or an allowance equivalent to their JSA entitlement, while on the pilot. Participation in the pilots will not affect eligibility for passported benefits. Private sector organisations will be paid for their success in placing people in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0316">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
I turn finally and briefly to the Social Security (Jobseeker's Allowance and Mariners' Benefits) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 1997. These amendments correct an anomaly in the current regulations which has come to light in the operation of JSA. JSA labour market conditions are applied across a full benefit week of seven days, but most jobseekers will have a period of a few days at the beginning of a claim for JSA before the cycle of full benefit weeks kicks in. The policy intention is that such jobseekers should still be required to act in such a way that they could meet the normal conditions of JSA had that period been a full week. But the current regulations have the effect of giving some jobseekers entitlement to JSA in that part-week period whether or not they are available for work or taking any steps to look for work. These amending regulations simply restore the original policy intention. In the case of the mariner's benefits, they remove an obsolete provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations, if approved, will be in force for only one year and will establish pilot schemes which will operate in specified areas. Any further extension is a matter for future consideration, which would include further scrutiny by the Social Security Advisory Committee and require further regulations to be put before Parliament. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.36 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Henry McLeish 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. Winterton, that you have a rather limited choice of members to call on this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Quality, quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McLeish</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that compliment, and sincerely hope that in the near future you will join the distinguished group of your fellow Chairmen who have been given the honour they deserve. I have got used to saying "Sir" in Committee; obviously, alas, in this case it will have to be "Mr.".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I last jousted with the Minister in employment skirmishes before the last election; it is interesting that I shall have the last skirmish with him before the next election. The Minister is clearly keen that we dispatch the business as quickly as possible, and I shall speak reasonably slowly, but not for too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Jobseeker' s allowance has existed since last October, and the obvious political rather than practical point to make is that there is still a fear that it has more to do with the move to workfare and manipulation of the figures than with a real intent to help Britain's jobless back into work through the medium of education, training, skills and participation in voluntary sector employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is still concern about the draft project work regulations. This is a useful opportunity to mention that even a distinguished Conservative Member, the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Sir R. Howell) was quoted in an article in the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> headlined "Tory MP hits at 'useless work'".
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"A Tory MP has complained about the 'useless' work being forced on unemployed people as part of the government's Project Work programme, which is being extended nationwide.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Sir Ralph Howell, MP for Norfolk North, said that during a visit to the two pilot schemes on Humberside and in Kent he had seen people 'chipping away at stone' and others digging ground unnecessarily."</p></blockquote>
The quality of such projects is always important, and I sincerely hope that it is kept constantly under review, because it is clear that, apart from the issue of the self-worth of people participating in projects, there must be a positive outcome. Cost-effectiveness must mean giving people the best opportunity possible, and schemes which have no worth must be identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other concern about widening the scope of projects relates to the insubstantial evidence on the basis of which the Government are now to spend a considerable amount of public money. The information about evaluation that is available to various organisations is limited; that reflects on the Department. Something more substantial should be done. No matter whether spending is on the unemployed or on education, we should have an eye to value for money for tax pounds spent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Unemployment Unit working brief of 1 November 1996, which is based on an analysis of some flimsy figures that the unit obtained from the Department, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So far, over 4,000 people have joined the existing two pilots and a total of 331 (8 per cent.) of them have been directly placed into work."</p></blockquote>
That is not a very impressive tally. Although pilot schemes are an important way of testing ideas, we must ensure that there are some substantial returns, even so early in the test, in terms of the number of people participating and the target outcomes that have been set by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a number of concerns about the workskill regulations. The Unemployment Unit, in another helpful brief, has raised several issues, which I want to put on the record. First, the unit has looked at existing projects and is concerned that under the regulations participants will still be required to abandon a course for a permanent, full-time job. It is a matter of balancing participation in education and training with employment—being on a course may sometimes be more important than getting a particular job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unit's second point is that the number of participants in the pilot schemes will be restricted, which will create a confusing combination of rules for providers and Employment Service staff to administer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unit's third point is that participants on part-time pilot schemes may be pushed into work for pay that they cannot afford to live on. That raises the controversial matter of wage costs and benefits. It requires some sensitivity to ensure that someone on a course or engaged in activities to find work is not constrained and pressurised by being pushed into other activities that will create further difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The unit's fourth point relates to the fact that the evaluation is set to measure success solely in terms of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V004P0I0317">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
alternative measures of success, including qualifications gained, and should make reference to the national education and training targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, significant numbers of unemployed people in the pilot areas who have not been in receipt of JSA for six months or more will find it much harder to study or train part time while receiving benefit, because they do not qualify either under the pilot scheme or under the current rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am keen to put on record some of our concerns, and I hope that the Minister will respond to the points that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.43 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forth</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the spirit in which he has properly asked his questions about what we are doing. I hope that that shows a degree of acceptances of the aims that we must share—to deal effectively with unemployment and to find the best ways of ensuring that everyone is given a realistic chance of obtaining work. There is much common ground between us, and I particularly welcome the hon. Gentleman's acceptance that the use of the pilot approach is legitimate in this matter. That is a view that we in the Department have come to and are now following up. In the same spirit, I shall do my best to answer as many of his questions as I can and, further to that, I hope that he will accept my undertaking to give him a considered response in writing, to ensure that we provide a proper reply to his questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman quoted my hon. Friend the Member for North Norfolk, who said that some people on the schemes were being forced to do useless work. I can speak only from my own experience of the project work pilots—as did my hon. Friend when he visited them. I was most struck by a scheme involving participants working in a hospice. They were doing what they as individuals and the hospice thought was meaningful work. I was told that, if it had not been for the project work participants making that vital connection with the aid of the Employment Service and the providers, there would have been no hope of the important work being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not pretend that every item of work done under existing pilot schemes was of that worth. All I can say is that we want to make the work worth while. The object of the exercise is to give individuals a sense of self worth—the experience of returning to a work environment, having been unemployed for a long time, and of doing something useful both to them and the person receiving their help. Of course, I accept that we must strive to ensure that their work is meaningful and, speaking from experience, I think that that is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall add to the list of matters mentioned by the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish). We must be vigilant about any substitution and displacement effect, especially as we hope to expand the projects if the Committee agrees to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
limited pilot schemes, but the more that they are extended, the more there is a danger of beginning to displace people who are already doing tasks in their own way, legitimately, for profit and, perhaps, employing other people. During the expanded pilot schemes and certainly in the evaluation phase, we must ensure that there is no such negative effect which, at worst, could off set the positive effects that we hope for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall consider what the hon. Member for Fife, Central said about the Unemployment Unit, but I do not want to become involved in a sterile debate on percentages. I shall give the hon. Gentleman whatever information we have on the numbers of people returning to work.

The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that difficult questions of judgment are involved in workskill courses. He asked whether someone participating in a workskill course who found work or was found work, should be expected to take that job, or should turn it down and complete the course. That is a difficult matter of judgment. At the moment, we believe that that person should be required to take the job because—to put it crudely—it is better in the longer term to have a job in hand and not finish the course, than to be given the chance to complete the course but perhaps not find work for some time. That is our judgment, but I accept that it is at least arguable. We will assess carefully the number of such conflicts and the effect that they have on individuals before we come to a final judgment.

Whether participants should be forced into work at a rate of pay that they consider to be incapable of sustaining their desired lifestyle is an established question. Our experts in jobcentres consider such matters with sensitivity. If there were cases in which that was not so, I hope that we would be alerted quickly so that we could deal with them.

I am prepared to accept the suggestion on evaluation of the hon. Member for Fife, Central. When we evaluate the schemes, we shall consider, for example, the nature and quality of the qualifications that people gain because the object of the exercise is to assess whether—we have always assumed this to be common sense—qualifications enhance employability. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman made a valid point, which I hope we shall take into account.

I have not dealt with all the points raised by the hon. Member for Fife, Central, but I shall write to him. I hope that he is happy to proceed broadly on the basis that I have suggested—we shall bear in mind his suggestions. In that spirit, I hope that the Committee will accept the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
