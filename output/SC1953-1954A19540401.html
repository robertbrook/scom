	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Neal</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a saying in the old Book, with which my hon. Friend the Member for Abertillery (Rev. Ll. Williams) is more familiar than myself,
	<br><blockquote><p>"…let not the sun go down upon your wrath."</p></blockquote>
I have obeyed that scriptural injunction and I am this morning removed from the passionate mood into which I was projected by hon. Members opposite last night.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Throughout the proceedings I have tried to display that magnanimity and tolerance which I think becomes one who might be described as charged with the task of secondary leadership. Such influence as I have on this side of the Committee has been exerted in favour of patience and restraint. Indeed, my hon. Friends will bear me out when I say that there have been occasions when my loyalty to them and my trade union has been considerably strained by the concessions I have made. The last thing with which the Minister could charge me would be any obstruction in the course of the proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been occasions when I have felt genuinely grieved at the intransigence of the Minister, but I have held on in the hope that we could rescue something that was really good out of the Bill with its complicated and ill-chosen language. Finally on this point, in the retrospective and calm mood in which I find myself this morning, I would inform the Minister that if his hon. Friends behind him are spoiling for a fight they can have one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neal</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They may beat us in voting, but we know that we can win the confidence of the 700,000 miners to whom the Bill applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the point of interruption last night I was discussing the importance of the Clause. Hon. Members who contemptuously sneer at the assertion that it is important should realise that when they sneer at the importance of ventilation in a pit they trifle with men's lives, and I am sure that they do not want to do that. Human life can be sustained for a long time without food and without water, but it cannot be sustained very long without air. Air in a pit is artificially created. That is perhaps not generally realised by those who are uninitiated in the practices of mining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It tickles my sense of humour sometimes when I hear Members demanding that the fans should be set going to improve ventilation in Committee rooms like this one. If they knew what ventilation is like underground, if they had felt the sense of confinement that there is in the pit with poor ventilation, they would realise the importance of our arguments on this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last night I was drawing an analogy from the sporting world. I mentioned the game of cricket. In this connection, it is a game in which the right hon. Gentleman has made the rules. The manager is the batsman, and the right hon. Gentleman says to him, "You can go in to bat and if you hit the ball and are caught, it will be a rebound and you will be not out. If you miss the ball and it hits the wicket, it will be a no ball." The manager gets two chances as a result of the Amendment which was accepted last night. The Amendment inserted the following words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"ceased to be adequate for the purposes mentioned yin the subsection (1) by reason (in either case) of an event which could not reasonably have been expected to be foreseen or, if foreseen, could not reasonably have been expected to be provided against."</p></blockquote>
If the erudite Member for Lanark (Mr. Patrick Maitland) translated that into Latin, his words would be just as intelligible to the miners as is the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
Amendment. How will it be understood by miners that the manager should have this escape route? When miners contrast the treatment of the manager with that of the workmen, many will be appalled. In the Bill where workmen are referred to they have to do things forthwith. There is an absolute duty imposed on them, yet invariably we find that Clauses such as this begin by imposing an absolute duty and then go off into all sorts of reservations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister should seriously consider the Clause even at this late stage, because of its gravity. He ought to consider taking it back and introducing more sensible language more suitable to the men in the industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Paling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not only during our discussion of this Clause but throughout our deliberations so far, I have been worried about the wording of the Bill and what have been described from time to time as the general principles. If this is a Bill of general principles, we as miners would expect that they should be equally applicable to both sides of the industry. Also we should have something from the Minister to give us an outline of the general principles to be applied to the industry. I assume that the Clause which deals with ventilation is another provision of general principle. Under the Clause we have not the foggiest idea what ventilation will be like. There are no set conditions laid down. We do not know the concentration of CO
	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> which would be allowed in the air current.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Clause is so wide that it ranges from absolute duties imposed on the miners to qualifications on the duties of the owners and the management. It makes us feel rather timid about accepting the Clauses so far. My hon. Friend the Member for Houghton-le-Spring (Mr. Blyton) said last night that already the position governing ventilation had been decided in previous Clauses. The question of roadways, their width and height and all the other arguments that we have had, must have a great effect on ventilation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we go through the Bill we find that the earlier Clauses represent a complete stranglehold on the general principles that we are trying to obtain for the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
I hold the same opinion that I formed when we started our consideration. The Bill is just a huge lump of wordiness and flatulence. We cannot make much sense out of what is contained in it. I am amazed that the Government have had the temerity—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. David Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Audacity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paling</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I change the word to audacity—the audacity to bring in a Bill of this kind for the greatest industry in the country when we know that the Measure must be absolutely first-class if we are to make the industry as safe as we feel that it should be. I am most disturbed about the whole question. The Clause about ventilation is so vague and qualified that one shudders to think what might happen, and yet the owners and managers will be able to get away with it. Like my hon. Friend, I think that the Minister should take the Clause away and give us something more satisfactory in its place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only does the Bill miss the whole point which it was originally intended to cover, but it shows nothing but a blatant partisan application of duties as between the miner, and the manager and owners. One cannot go forward with a Bill of this description. I urge the Minister to reconsider not only the Clause but the whole Bill as far as we have gone. I am most disturbed. If the Bill goes right through the Committee stage, then when we come to Third Reading there will be the biggest fight in the House that there ever has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tom Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that hon. Members opposite and the Minister will begin to wonder why we are so persistent in our demand that this Clause should be taken back and redrafted, but I think the right hon. Gentleman will understand our attitude if he will try to visualise what we have experienced in the mines of this country in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the Minister that the proposals we have put forward have not been submitted out of any degree of stupidity, but that we have put forward arguments based on our experience. Here we have a Clause which differs very considerably from Section 29 of the 1911 Act. When I was meditating last night upon our discussions in this Committee, I was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1253</span>
inclined to think that we would be well advised to go back to the 1911 Act, and, starting with Section 1, amend it as we go through it in the light of our experience since then, but that is an impossibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel very strongly on the subject of ventilation. We on this side of the Committee all know, and I am sure that hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite also realise, the importance of adequate ventilation in the pit. It is the lifeblood of the pit, and we cannot continue to operate a mine without adequate ventilation unless we run a considerable risk. Ventilation is important not only to maintain a standard of comfort in the pit, but also from the point of view of the health of the men working in the pits, so that if the ventilation is not adequate, they run two risks. One is that they may suffer physically as a result of inadequate ventilation, and the second is that they run considerable risk of losing their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken the trouble to look at the records of the explosions which have taken place in the area of Lancashire in which I live, and I find that from 1852 to 1910—before the passing of the 1911 Coal Mines Act—there were 24 serious explosions, and that 95 per cent. of those explosions, according to the evidence revealed at the subsequent inquiries, were due to inadequate ventilation. When we arrive at a state of affairs like that, with 24 explosions in that period of time, can the Government or the Committee wonder why we are so persistent in our demand that this Clause should be taken back?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another vital point that has to be considered. In years gone by, when our pits were not manned to the extent which they are today, we had pits which, if they employed 300 men, were considered large pits, but today, in some modern pits, we may have as many as 1,500 or even 2,000 men and boys working underground at one time. That is a matter that should be taken into consideration by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was the number of lives lost in the series of explosions to which I have referred? The lowest number was six, and the highest, which concerned an explosion in December, 1910, when, at the Pretoria pit in Lancashire, 344 men and boys were hurled into eternity. Why? Because somebody had failed, and failed
	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>
miserably, to see that there was adequate ventilation in that pit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No further words of mine are required in stressing the importance of this matter, and I am not arguing the case from my own point of view, but because I have taken the trouble to search the evidence submitted by people who know something about the conditions in that pit prior to that terrible explosion. Since those days, we have tried repeatedly to impress upon the Ministry, upon the inspectors and the mine managers the importance of adequate ventilation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very much afraid that in the future, we shall have to change our attitude towards this Bill if we are to continue to discuss it as we have done up to now. How true were the words used by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Neal), when he said that, with the exception of one or two little upheavals, we have so far tried to manifest patience and tolerance and listen to what has been said by the Minister, but I am afraid that the right hon. Gentleman is not doing what we expected he would do. I am not saying that he is not being patient; he has been very patient, but he is not conceding the points which we have put to him as we have proceeded through the various clauses of the Bill. Why should there be this stupidity and lack of understanding manifested by the Minister?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading I told the Minister that we did not embrace this Bill with both arms or welcome it 100 per cent., but what we did say was that this was a Bill for which we had been waiting for years. I went so far as to say that we would help him in every conceivable way when we reached the Committee stage and would do all in our power to make the Bill better than it was. What do we find? When we considered our proposals for amending the Bill, and before they reached the Order Paper, we established a reason for every Amendment that was put down and a reason for every argument advanced. Despite that, we have the Minister still saying that he cannot accept our Amendments, and he endeavours to defend his action by giving us reasons which do not suit us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister and his Department will take back this Clause and examine it in their quiet moments, and, in con-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1255</span>
junction with that examination, examine some of the evidence given after explosions such as those to which I have referred, they will find, both in that evidence and in our arguments here, good reasons why we are so persistent, and rightly so, that in this Bill there should be a Clause which stipulates that adequate ventilation should be provided for our men in the pits, and nothing less than that will suit this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Blyton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not apologise for one word of what I said last night. When the Second Reading debate took place, I told the Minister in closing that debate, that we might put down 500 Amendments to it, and I do not think I shall be far short when we reach the end of the Committee stage, but I also think that the Minister himself will run a good second. When we come to deal with quarries, we shall get a lot more Amendments, perhaps as many again, so that if, at the end of the Committee stage, we have had to deal with about 900 or 1,000 Amendments to this Bill, it will indicate to the world at large that this Bill, as originally drafted, was so impossible of operation that 1,000 Amendments had to be made to improve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We did not oppose the Bill on Second Reading, because we thought, quite sincerely, that if it received a Second Reading in the House and reached the Committee stage, we would be able by means of argument, to deal with the escape clauses which, as we pointed out on Second Reading, run right through the Bill. We thought we could make a job of it when we got here, but we have failed miserably, not because our arguments have been destroyed, but because we have been beaten by the Government's majority, about which we do not complain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would ask the Minister quite sincerely to rename his Bill. He ought to call it the "National Coal Board and Managers' Protection Bill," because, if we go through the Bill carefully, we see that managers and owners are protected in every Clause in which they are concerned, but, when we come to the case of the men, absolute duties and penalties have been imposed even in the case of a man forgetting to do something.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
I still say that we have done our best to make this a safety Bill, but our arguments have not been heeded by the Minister in respect of the most important Clauses in the Bill, and I must still point out to the miners outside that this Bill will bring them into more litigation about accidents than was ever the case before. I therefore say to them that they had better agitate now to stop this Bill, and, instead, continue to operate under the provisions of the 1911 Act, with its clarity of wording, and seek to effect improvements by means of regulations in order to meet the conditions that arise in modern mining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another difficulty, and a fundamental one, is that what the Minister thinks should be provided for in Regulations concerns what we regard as vital principles, and, apart from a terrible fight to get refuge holes established in the Bill, we have been turned down every time on questions of humidity and now on ventilation. We have now reached the position when we find that we shall get safety established in the pits—and that is the very embodiment of this Bill—if it does not cost too much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I say quite frankly that the Minister, at this stage in the Bill, when we have reached only Clause 55, has placed us in the terrible position of finding the 1911 Act to be better than this Bill. Our men have got to read this Bill and understand it, but, for heaven's sake, let hon. Members look at Clause 78, dealing with the withdrawal of workers in case of danger. Let us look at subsection (2, 
	<i>b</i>), which says—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should wait until we get to that Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blyton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will leave the suggestion with the Government, and hope they will see if they can understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My last point is this. What is to happen about ventilation in regard to inbye fans which are stopped at the week-end, as a result of which there is an accumulation of gas? What do we find? On the Monday morning when the pit starts operation, there is a vast accumulation of gas which has taken place over the week-end because the fans have been stopped. There is nothing more dangerous than stopping these fans and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1257</span>
allowing gas to accumulate in the working places over the week-end. We should like to know more about this particular problem. Are we still to have the problem of gas accumulating in the mine at the week-end, with the result that it has to be pumped out when the pit restarts? I would ask the Minister at least to give some indication to the Committee of the Government's point of view on this question of stopping the inbye fans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Raymond Gower</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like my right hon. Friend to deal with the suggestion that the wording in this Clause, as in other Clauses of the Bill, is not as good as the wording in the 1911 Act. That suggestion has been made repeatedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Neal) should have made the suggestion that because he heard a slight murmur from someone on this side of the Committee in about its 15th sitting, we were spoiling for a fight. I think that was quite unworthy of him. We are just as keen as hon. Members opposite that this should be a good Bill. On a number of occasions when we have thought something would be useful, hon. Members on this side of the Committee have supported the views presented on the other side.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bernard Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member explain, in the light of that statement, why hon. Members opposite have voted every time against our proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I thought that it was unworthy that because one Member opposite heard some slight murmur of disapproval in the 15th sitting of the Committee, he should attribute such motives to us on this side. On several occasions when my hon. Friends and myself have thought that we were in sympathy with hon. Members opposite on a particular matter, we have supported that view and spoken in favour of their Amendment. On each occasion that we have done so, the Minister has given an undertaking that he would reconsider the matter. That statement can be checked by a reference to the OFFICIAL REPORT of the previous meetings of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that in this, as in other Clauses, there is this great divide between
	<span class='label label-info column'>1258</span>
us as to whether what we want to do should be done by regulations or whether a maximum standard should be worded into the Bill. As I see it, the virtue of the 1911 Act was that the standards worded into it were so very good. I concede that. The weakness of the 1911 Act was that these standards could not be easily improved in changing conditions. I think that the Minister and his advisers want to avoid that weakness of the 1911 Act, and hon. Members opposite are afraid that we shall miss the virtues of the 1911 Act. I should like the Minister to deal with these allegations which have been repeatedly thrown across the floor of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that he will also deal with this particular matter, because I think that we agreed on both sides that there is room for some adjustment. Perhaps we should go further on Report to have the standard actually worded into the Bill. The Minister will have power to improve these standards by regulation if he provides that power in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have come nearly to breaking point—and when I get to breaking point, it is the breaking point. I have an element of sympathy with hon. Members opposite in putting their claims and sympathising with us. I also appreciate that they have once or twice persuaded the Minister to take things back. The difficulty is that the Minister is having too many things to take back, and when we come to the Report stage we shall have to accept them whether we like them or not. That is the fundamental issue. We know that we shall be definitely defeated when on Report and Third Reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say seriously to the right hon. Gentleman what I emphasised on Second Reading. We did not vote against the Bill then, but we expressed the desire that we should be able effectively to use logical arguments in Committee whereby the Minister would agree to a lot of things which we desire and so make this Bill a worthy 1954 Mines and Quarries Measure. Unfortunately, that has not happened up to now. I see the weakness of the Bill in comparison with the 1911 Act and that is my worry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have heard hon. Members opposite talking about ventilation and humidity. An hon. Member opposite who spoke
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1259</span>
yesterday said, "You haven't the difficulty of mosquitoes." In tropical countries the people have mosquito nets, but our boys in the mines have not got mosquito nets.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. L. Iremonger</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that my intervention yesterday was in no way intended to deprecate the hazards of mining. Perhaps I may say, in my own defence, that I have known things which are probably more uncomfortable and a great deal more dangerous than a coalmine.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apart from the dangers of military conflict, I have been in industrial conflict for too many years for my liking. Hon. Members opposite may go down a pit for a brief visit and feel that they are suffering from claustrophobia, but our boys have to suffer from that for more or less a lifetime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am very annoyed with the right hon. Gentleman when he says to my hon. Friends, "I am willing to reconsider our Clause if you will withdraw your Amendment, and then we will reconsider the whole matter and place our conclusions before hon. Members on the Report stage." I think that the right hon. Gentleman—and I sympathise with him—is going to have far too much to consider in far too short a time. So far as I am concerned, if there are not some vast alterations in the Bill, I shall endeavour to see that the Bill does not go through. I make no apologies for saying that, but we do not want to be accused of filibustering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to ventilation, I suggest that is one of the most important factors with which we have to deal. What is aggravating me is that litigation is coming far to the front. We are here dealing with a safety Bill. Throughout the whole of the Bill there are most important factors, apart from the possibilities of litigation. There are defects which concern our own people. The advantages are all on the side of the Coal Board. I wish that we could have an array of advisers from the National Union of Mineworkers similar to the Managers' Associations of the Coal Board. They have an array of talented advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1260</span>
Speaking for myself, I am not going to be one to minimise the regulation, and I want to see that our people toe the line and carry out the rules and regulations. But I am going to be equally insistent that there should be absolute duties on the employers, agents and managers, right down to the shot firers. I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter, and I think that it would be better if this Clause were deleted and redrafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Colonel C. G. Lancaster</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find myself rather puzzled. I cannot, after listening very carefully to the whole of the debate yesterday, see what precisely is actuating hon. Members opposite this morning. Is it the substance of this Clause, or that certain aspects of the Clause have not a great deal to do with the substance, which they are worried about?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am probably the only Member on this side of the Committee with practical knowledge of ventilation, and I frankly admit that my knowledge is not, in my opinion, sufficient to allow me to join in debating something as highly technical as ventilation. I am not certificated. I have only a general working knowledge of conditions in the pits, and I do not feel that I know more about the subject than the advisers to the Ministry who have helped to draft this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have listened to hear whether there was something in the Clause which was wrong so far as ventilation itself is concerned; either with regard to velocity, volume or the adequacy of brattice cloth screens or things of that nature. I have not heard that. I heard, however, considerable objections of a legal type, some of which were rather above my head, concerning legal proceedings, and I also heard a good deal of concern—and, I think, justifiable concern—about the particular phraseology in regard to the Bill itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite have my sympathy on that point. There is, no doubt, considerable reason, as I said on Second Reading, to have cause for concern about the phraseology of this Bill as a whole, as against the phraseology which eventually formed part of the 1911 Act. I have sympathy with hon. Members opposite in regard to that, but despite that, I cannot see what they feel

is wrong in this Clause in regard to ventilation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I recognise that there is concern—and, I think, unreasonable concern—that there is greater protection for the managers than there is for the men in carrying out the Regulations under this Clause. There are two points of view on that. We must get back to the important fundamental approach of this Clause. Is it that hon. Members opposite find that there is something wrong in regard to the rules and regulations which are to be laid down concerning ventilation? Let us for a moment leave aside the legal proceedings and respective responsibilities of the men and management, phraseology and the like, and get down to ventilation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is there something in this Clause as effecting the Regulations which is so wrong that it merits the request that the whole Clause should be withdrawn? I cannot see that myself. I should like elucidation on that point. No doubt, when the Minister replies, he will give his opinion in regard to this matter. Before I make up my mind on this point, I should like one hon. Member opposite to explain to me and to other hon. Members what is wrong so far as this Clause is concerned in the matter of ventilation. Are the rules and regulations inadequate to ensure that we get adequate ventilation and the type of ventilation which, in all the circumstances, will militate against disasters and troubles in the pit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that can be shown, then I, and, no doubt, other hon. Members on this side, will throw our weight on the side of hon. Members opposite. Until I am satisfied on that point, I cannot do that. I should like an explanation from some hon. Member opposite with regard to what is wrong with the substance of this Clause. If that can be done we shall not be unreasonable on this side of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ronald Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I at once take up the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for South Fylde (Colonel Lancaster) on that very point. We are discussing the Motion. "That the Clause stand part of the Bill." and we are asking the Minister to take it back. If he can give us that assurance we can get on
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
quickly; if not, then quite clearly we must vote against the Motion. This Clause has been amended, and so one must look at the whole Clause when we are discussing this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and gallant Member asked us what was wrong with the ventilation part of the Clause. I make no assertion that there is anything wrong with the provisions regarding ventilation if they stood alone, but that is not what we will be voting on. We will be voting on that and on ancillary matters. I put this to the hon. and gallant Gentleman, because when he puts a point of this sort he puts it with the utmost sincerity and I know he will not be in the least influenced on the subject by the fact that the Whips are on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that there are the soundest reasons for the Minister to take the Clause back for reconsideration. If he then produces a Clause relating only to the question of ventilation and excluding these other matters which form part of the Clause and to which we have taken objection, then we will have no case against the Clause. If he does not concede what we ask, then we shall have to vote against the Motion. This question of ventilation cannot be considered on this Motion in isolation, because it is not in isolation in the Clause. I hope that I have made clear to the hon. and gallant Member what the essence of our case is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Which other matters is the hon. Member thinking of?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to shorten the proceedings but I will mention the other matters. I do not want to deploy further arguments or repeat those which have already been made on various Amendments in this Clause. But the line which I draw is this. The hon. and gallant Member for South Fylde asks me what is wrong with the ventilation part of this Clause. If we are in agreement on the ventilation part of it, it then follows that the hon. and gallant Member must be asking us to consider it separately. If it is considered separately and forms the basis of an entirely new Clause, then the logic of the submission made by the hon. and gallant Member is that the Minister should take this Clause back for reconsideration, which he would not do if this were to go to a vote. The hon. and gallant Member has provided us with an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1263</span>
additional and cogent reason for the Clause being reconsidered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take two minutes on the point which I want to put against the Motion because of what I have said in reply to the hon. and gallant Member. Obviously hon. Members on the other side of the Committee have not fully appreciated the gravity with which we on this side of the Committee now view the whole Bill in view of what has been done on the Government side. It is a very sad state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me, as my first reason, point to a remark made by the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) who at the moment is not in his place. He gave the impression to the Committee—and I am quite sure, from my knowledge of the hon. Member, that he would not wish to say anything which might mislead the Committee at all—that he looked upon the Committee as a sort of round table conference. But when a point was taken sharply against him he voted against our proposals, and I understood him to say—I wish he were here to confirm this, although it will be within the recollection of the Committee—that that was when an assurance had been given by the Minister and we had not accepted it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that is not quite the case. As recently as last evening on the legal aspect of this Clause, in proposing a certain Amendment I submitted as strongly as I could that if the arguments could not be accepted, in view of the anxiety on this side of the House then at least the Minister should take it back and look at it again. It was not a question at that stage of accepting our Amendment, and although the Minister would not give us any assurance on the matter, the hon. Member for Barry and his colleagues voted as the Whips wanted them to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt about the hon. Gentleman's sincerity, but he must not give the impression to the Committee—I am sure the hon. Member will agree with this—that it is only when assurances are given from his side of the Committee and are not accepted by us on this side of the Committee, that he then votes against us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Gower</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Member will agree that what I said was in each case on which I spoke on an Amendment it just happened that the Minister did give an assurance, and that can be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1264</span>
proved by reference to the OFFICIAL REPORT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. Member is back, because in his absence, as will be agreed by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who were present, I paid tribute to his sincerity, and I was most anxious not to create a mistaken impression. I will repeat what I said for the benefit of the hon. Member. On the legal part of this Clause, no assurance came from his side of the Committee even though we asked that because of its complexity the Government would take a look at it to see if anything could be done to improve it. There was a vote, and the hon. Member for Barry and his colleagues voted with the Government side of the Committee while we voted with our side of the Committee. That does not in any way reflect on the hon. Member for Barry. It is an indication that a wrong impression could have been given to us this morning by what he said. I hope we understand the position perfectly now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with these two points because of the observations of the hon. and gallant Member for South Fylde, and the hon. Member for Barry, but the point I want to make in all seriousness to the Minister is that later in this Bill he is going to ask us to agree to a proposal that if a workman negligently omits to do anything necessary for securing the health of persons employed in the pit—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to quote details of subsequent Clauses. I am putting it as a principle. If a workman negligently omits to do something to secure the health of persons employed in the pit that workman is guilty of a criminal offence under the Bill. How can the Minister expect this side of the Committee to accept that situation, and then, when he is dealing with a Clause like this, sponsors various points by which the management is enabled to escape?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to the hon. and gallant Member for South Fylde that it is not a question of trying to drive a wedge. We are looking at the situation in relation to our own men in complete sincerity and with the knowledge of what is in the Bill. There is no "reasonably practicable" for the men when it comes to negligently
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1265</span>
omitting to do something necessary for securing the health of persons employed in the pit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the Minister, who after all—and I say this with the deepest sincerity—is a fairminded individual, must appreciate that this point is sharply in issue between us, and if the Government gave an indication that there was a slip or if something was to be done to meet our wishes in this matter, then that would be something to meet our point. Instead of that, we are being left to assume that the Government accept the Clause as it is despite the grave disquietude on this side of the Committee. Consequently, in the face of all these factors, including the fact that the Minister adheres to his view, and that there is nothing in the arguments which have been put sharply by us, I ask my colleagues to join with me in voting against the Motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Victor Raikes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for South Fylde (Colonel Lancaster) is any less befogged after the speech of the hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. R. Williams), but I confess that I am still utterly befogged. The hon. Member, in what I thought was a reasonable speech, pointed out that there is no great difference between us on the question of ventilation but in regard to the extraneous matters—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir V. Raikes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, extraneous matters in the Clause. Before the hon. Member for Wigan spoke I heard a number of speeches from the other side of the Committee which indicated that some hon. Members thought that we on this side were rather frivolous about ventilation and also that as it stands the Clause does not meet the ventilation question. I do not pretend that I am as expert on ventilation as my hon. and gallant Friend, the Member for South Fylde, but I should have gone as far as the hon. Member for Wigan in believing that it is reasonably covered in the Clause. Some speeches on the other side seem to show considerable confusion of view whether this is so or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then we come to the other point made by the hon. Member for Wigan which I think really comes down to this. We do not want any heat in these matters but we want to clear our minds and under-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1266</span>
stand what we are arguing about. I think the hon. Gentleman's point was that the Amendment which was inserted by the Minister last night gave in his view, and possibly in the view of hon. Members on the other side of the Committee, what they would describe as absolute protection to the manager. That, of course, has been tied up in a number of speeches by hon. Members opposite with certain other Clauses later on, to which it would be most improper for me to refer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Surely where it is necessary for an intelligent discussion on a Clause to be conducted, it is perfectly in order to refer in general terms to what is proposed subsequently in the Bill. What is not in order in my submission, subject to your Ruling, Mr. Bowles, is to quote the subsequent provisions and go into a sort of preview debate upon a Clause which is not yet the subject of debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first time that this arose was when the hon. Member for Houghton-le-Spring (Mr. Blyton) was talking last night, and I let him go on because he was making a comparison between certain liabilities on the workmen and certain liabilities—I think the word used in that connection is "escapes"—on the manager. I think the hon. Member for Garston (Sir V. Raikes) will be in order in referring to it as much as hon. Members on the Opposition side of the Committee have done. I think the Clauses in question are Clauses 88 and 89.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir V. Raikes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged, Mr. Bowles. I was anxious not to go too far into the future. I can sum up by saying that, as I understood it, there was a fear on the other side of the Committee that a high degree of protection is given to the manager in this Clause whereas, later on in the Bill, there is a differentiation between the position of the workmen as against the managers. If that is the objection to this Clause, surely it narrows and clarifies the difference of opinion here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the further point of the Amendment of my right hon. Friend last night, perhaps we had a tiny bit more heat than we sometimes have, but I know there was no ill-feeling on either side of the Committee. The Minister made it plain that he was not entirely happy with the words
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1267</span>
of his Amendment, but he felt that the Clause needed further Amendment to safeguard the position of the manager. He was not happy over the word "unforeseen" and, when we had the vote on that for want of better wording, I understood that it in no way way precluded what I gathered was, and still is, the intention of my right hon. Friend to consider whether it is possible to improve that rather difficult wording between now and the later stages of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not feel that it made a great deal of difference at that stage whether we inserted the words of the Amendment yesterday with the promise I have just referred to, or inserted something else instead at a later stage. The fact remains that the door is wide open for getting away from the word "unforeseen" if we can find something better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen a difficulty running through this Bill, and it has been brought to an issue on this Clause. It is the genuine difference of opinion which comes up time after time between the two sides as to whether the manager should have an absolute duty or whether that duty should be qualified. It is a question of principle to some degree, although the duty of the manager may be altered in different Clauses by my right hon. Friend. On this side of the Committee we have felt all along, and we have made it plain from the start—it has not appeared simply with Clause 55—that an absolute duty imposed upon the manager, by which proceedings can be taken against him if something which could not be foreseen happens, is wrong. If that were so there would be such a strait-jacket that it would be almost impossible to get men to take up jobs as managers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blyton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman does not want to be unfair to us. We have stated all through these Clauses that where a duty is placed upon the manager, he is entitled to have a defence for something which is not foreseen, but if he can foresee a thing we take the view that he should be obliged to do something, having foreseen it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we have offered to look at that point, recognising the difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir V. Raikes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friends would agree
	<span class='label label-info column'>1268</span>
that there is that distinction between what can be foreseen and what is unforeseen and it is carried a little further on the grounds of what is reasonably practicable. Where there has been a difference of opinion all through is on the point that it is necessary that the management shall feel that they have a reasonable degree of protection in regard to matters in which it would need genius to prevent any special form of accident. We feel that is necessary if this Bill is to become an Act, as indeed I still hope it will.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is saying that in no circumstances, so far as he can see, should an absolute duty be imposed upon the manager. Did I understand him correctly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir V. Raikes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not go so far as to say that under no circumstances should an absolute duty be placed upon the manager, but I do say that throughout the whole of this Bill he must be given a certain amount of protection against matters occurring against which it might be said he could not be expected to provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman seriously suggesting that the management in the mine should be in a privileged position as compared with the management in factories, where an absolute duty obtains in specified cases and where there is no defence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir V. Raikes</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am not, and, as I have made plain, that is not the position here. Hon. Members on both sides of the Committee realise that there are conditions in mines which raise entirely different aspects than those which can be raised in factories. However, I have risen to clarify—I have been too long over it—the real difference of opinion on this Clause, namely, that it is not the question of inadequate ventilation but that once again there has arisen a difference of opinion between the two sides of the Committee as to what should be the degree of the escape Clause for the management. That is the main issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite must clear their minds on one thing: are they satisfied that, with the escape clauses for the management on certain issues which we have laid down from the start, this Measure is inferior to that of the 1911 Act? If they take that view, they can
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1269</span>
stop this Bill, but I think it is the view of most hon. Members on both sides of the Committee that, even with these escape clauses, this Bill is an advance upon the 1911 Act even if it is not quite so well drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Mason</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that at last we have come back to the point at issue. Hon. Gentlemen opposite are right to feel worried because I am only rising to state briefly my protest at the callous indifference of the Minister on the light treatment of the management and men in the pits of today. We who are conversant with the pits have seen the obligations and absolute duties imposed on the men where, if there is a contravention of transport or support rules, or any of the orders given by the manager or any mine Regulations, they shall be guilty of an offence. That is quite clearly stated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, on the most important issues in this Bill, such as ventilation, we see that the manager has escape clauses provided even after we lave tried to place an absolute duty on him at the beginning of the Clause. For instance, it states quite clearly here:
	<br><blockquote><p>"there shall be held not to have been such a failure if it is shown"—</p></blockquote>
Then all the escape reasons are given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the last straw. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr. D. Griffiths) has said, this is the breaking point. We have discussed and discussed escape clauses for the management but none for workmen. We are hound to see now the difference in the attitude of hon. Members on either side of the Committee against the escape clauses that have been provided continually for management.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. F. P. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point of comparison between the obligations on the manager and the men, surely there is nothing in this Clause which relieves the manager of obligation for negligence? The only obligation that is imposed upon the miner by the later Clauses is a liability for doing something negligently or wilfully. That is all. There is nothing in this Clause, or elsewhere in the Bill, to relieve the manager from full responsibility for anything negligent in his conduct.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mason</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to enlighten the hon. Gentleman There is no point
	<span class='label label-info column'>1270</span>
in stating at the 'beginning of Clause 48, which deals with support, "It shall be the duty," and then later in the Clause stating in subsection (2)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"there shall be held not to have been such a failure if it is shown"—</p></blockquote>
and then later in paragraph (
	<i>a</i>)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"he was in possession of all information which it was reasonably practicable for him to obtain…"</p></blockquote>
and later—
	<br><blockquote><p>"that it was not reasonable to suppose that it was necessary to take steps.…"</p></blockquote>
In every instance where it is stated at the beginning of a Clause that "It shall be the duty," later in the same Clause we give all the escape routes that the manager requires. For instance, in Clause 40—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman could make his point on Clause 55.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mason</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The same applies, Mr. Bowles, in all the Clauses dealing with support, height and width of roads, and ventilation. It is important to notice later in the Bill in Clause 88 that all the rules are laid down for the workmen, that no escape routes are provided, and that it states briefly and clearly that he shall be guilty of an offence. That is the main point at issue. This is where we have to state on this side of the Committee that we are no longer willing to accept, with the comparative indifference that we have done previously, the insertion of these escape routes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Colonel Ralph Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand it, one of the principal causes of anxiety on the opposite side of the Committee is that greater obligations are imposed on the managers than on the men in the case of offences, and that the manager has certain escape routes if he makes a mistake, whereas there is an absolute duty on the mine worker. There is a certain amount of common sense in that.

After all, anybody set in authority is responsible not only for himself; he has to deal with the human element. One can only be absolutely responsible for what one does oneself. The mines manager has also to deal with the natural element. The hon. Member for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0645">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1271</span>
Wigan (Mr. R. Williams) asked why we could not treat a factory and a mine in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing of the kind. I asked an hon. Member opposite whether he was asserting that there should in no circumstances be an absolute duty applied to management in the pits, and whether he was saying that the management in the pits would be in a privileged position as compared with management in factories where, I put it, there were certain instances where absolute duty applied and there could be no defence whatever. That is a very different point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Colonel Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not trying to mislead the Committee. I think that my point was the same. We cannot apply the same standards when we are dealing with natural forces, as in the mine, compared with when we are dealing in a factory with matters which are under human control almost entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and gallant Member is putting the point in far too general terms. It was not put from this side of the Committee in that form at all. To put it specifically, is he asserting that if we have dangerous machinery in a factory we can have absolute liability, but we cannot have a similar liability in a mine? Is he asserting that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Colonel Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: To a certain degree, I am—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Dangerous machinery?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Colonel Clarke</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—because the machinery works within certain limits; natural forces do not. The mine manager is dealing with two factors—the human element and the natural element. Therefore, we cannot impose such absolute liability upon him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has often been said that it would be possible to have a perfect private soldier capable of obeying orders and carrying them out; but it is absolutely impossible to have any soldier above the lowest rank perfect, because his liability to error is so much greater. For that reason, I feel that to expect to be able to impose exactly the same standards on the mine manager as on the worker is really not common sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. W. Jones</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister will agree that from the first sitting of the Committee to the present moment there has been no trace of filibustering. This morning we have been at it for more than an hour discussing the Clause after what was said yesterday. The Minister must be impressed with the fact that the heat, anger and disgust expressed on this side this morning must be due to something very serious indeed. I want him to take advantage of the experience of these men. I do not agree with one of my hon. Friends who suggested that the Minister could be callous. If we on this side of the Committee had to choose a Minister of Fuel and Power from the opposite side, we should choose the right hon. Gentleman. That is our feeling towards him. There is nothing personal in his manner.

I make the appeal to the Minister to do the big thing so that we can proceed for the next one and a half hours to the other Clauses. Will he take this Clause back and have a good look at it?

We should like to continue to do so, because we should like to feel that the discussions were in the hands of those on both sides who really have special knowledge of the subject; but it seems to me that the Committee

If it were true that the Bill were imposing a different obligation upon manager and worker, to the disadvantage of the worker, I assure the Committee that we on this side would be as ready to take up that matter and to act upon it as would hon. Members opposite. If I am mistaken in my interpretation, we are still ready to be convinced that we ought to put pressure on the Minister; but I do not think that that is so. There is a different formula used in Clause 55 which imposes this liability on the manager. It is quite a different formula from that used later on in Clauses 88 and 89 which impose obligations upon the worker.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The obligation imposed upon the manager is in form an absolute obligation to start with. It says that it shall be the duty of the manager to do certain things. Then, having imposed the obligation in that form, it gives a way of escape if certain things can be shown. Surely, nobody can reasonably argue that, having imposed obligations of this kind upon the management, if legal proceedings subsequently follow owing to a failure, it should be a defence that the manager should be able to show that the cause of the trouble was an accident or breakdown—in other words, something for which he himself could not have been responsible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Member is addressing himself strongly to a point which the Government themselves are satisfied is entirely without substance. The Government themselves have introduced an Amendment. Since they are not satisfied with the Clause, does the hon. Member persist in his argument in this respect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bishop</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. R. Williams) is right when he says that an Amendment has been accepted and the question about unforeseen circumstances has been put in; but that does not alter the principle behind what I was saying, which is that the method adopted in the Clause imposing the liability upon the manager starts in form as an absolute obligation and provides a way of escape if the failure is due to something which was not his fault.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1274</span>
My purpose in mentioning the point was to compare that with the very different formula used later on when the obligation upon the worker in the mine is imposed. There is no formula of absolute obligation at all; it is a question of disobedience or something done negligently or wilfully. The obligation of the worker arises only if there is something negligent or wilful. As I said in an earlier intervention, there is certainly nothing in Clause 55 or elsewhere, as far as I have been able to see, that relieves the manager from full liability where there may be any negligence on his part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the argument of hon. Gentlemen opposite that there is in the Bill a different or higher obligation imposed on the worker than on the manager is sound. That was the point which I wanted to make. I still say that if I am wrong I, as strongly as any hon. Member opposite, should be ready to ask the Minister to see that the matter is put right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Albert Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to try to detach myself from any rhetoric or beat. While we do not want to engender any heat, we do not want to be cold, calculating machines. At least we want to be human.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We must all try to be human when we are dealing with a serious matter such as this. There has been reference to the 1911 Act as a model of clarity. It is difficult to reconcile that with the fact that for a long time we have been asking for new legislation. While there may be clarity in some respects, we have not got what we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must admit that ventilation in our mines is far better than it was 20 years ago, and there is no doubt that in the Bill there is a serious endeavour to go further. It will be seen from the 1947 Regulations, which cover coal mine ventilation, that cognisance is taken of all the difficulties caused by the introduction of electrically operated machinery. We must remember that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proper that we should be concerned about questions of ventilation, humidity and so on. What is disturbing the minds of my hon. Friends? Why should there be this feeling of discontent? I wish to address myself to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0647">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1275</span>
these matters because I am anxious that the Bill should go through, but we want the final result to be acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Merioneth (Mr. T. W. Jones) said, we have a Minister who is overflowing with the milk of human kindness, and naturally he wants to ensure that the Bill is acceptable to all concerned. It has been pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. R. Williams) that what is disturbing our minds is that we feel that the mineworker has as much right to justice as has the factory worker.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are anxious that the mineworker should get the right kind of justice. He should get the same kind of justice that a factory worker gets. If there is a machine in a factory and the fencing is faulty and a workman suffers injury, there is a case for common action and justice. These things do happen in mines, yet we are allowing loopholes for the manager to escape.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember the Creswell disaster, which was a terrible thing. I know that it may have cost the National Coal Board a lot of money, but that cost in money was not equal to the lives lost to the industry. Creswell Colliery had modern conditions, but it failed in one vital respect, which caused the disaster, and we are bound to agree that there was some negligence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just after the disaster, I approached a certain face, which had only one way in and a gate a mile and a half long. The return airway had almost collapsed, but the manager told me that I was trying to jeopardise his position. He said, "I think you are trying to damn this mine." I replied that I was not trying to get anyone into trouble, but I wanted to see that those men had a fair chance of escape if anything happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All we are asking here is that these men should have the right to common decency and justice, and I hope that the Minister will realise what is in our minds when he notices that our tempers have been somewhat frayed during the past 24 hours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1276</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. J. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Normanton (Mr. A. Roberts) has put forward very lucidly and calmly the same line of argument which I wanted to follow, and has tried to explain to the Minister and his advisers why we have taken up this attitude on this Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment to line 16 put forward by the Minister was the culmination of a series of Amendments putting words into Clause after Clause of this Bill in order to give escape loopholes to the manager. But it seems to me that, as a matter of fact, we are fighting for the management as well as the men in what we are seeking to provide, because we want to make the Bill foolproof, if it is possible to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remember that a few years ago there was a serious accident—though not in my part of the country—in which a number of men lost their lives because the management were concentrating on production. They were devising an airway, but, because of men being absent from their places, they withdrew men from where they were working to the place where they were driving the airway in order to fill the places of absentees, until it became a race between completing the airway and something serious happening. Of course, the danger should have been foreseen, but unfortunately the explosion came first and the men lost their lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and gallant Member for East Grinstead (Colonel Clarke) has said that it is not possible to compare conditions in the mine with the conditions in factories, but what is bothering us about this Clause is that we cannot hold the manager responsible for foreseen things. We might have the collapse of airways—not one, but many of them—which might be absolutely unforeseen, and the manager is not to be held responsible for that; but what we are concerned about is that phrase in the Clause which refers to dangers which are foreseen. Time after time in the Clauses of this Bill, these escape provisions are put in, and particularly in the case of the last Amendment of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger) spoke about mosquitoes. I have had some experience of mosquitoes. There is nothing more annoying than when one is under a mosquito net and a mosquito gets into the room and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1277</span>
goes buzzing around. It is not the bite but the noise that disturbs one. We have the same kind of thing going through this Bill, and I want the Minister to take note of the words he has used in regard to dangers that can be foreseen, but against which the manager could not reasonably have been expected to provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know if that will cover bad ventilation, because, as with the case of most of these difficulties in the mines, these things are progressive. There is a progressive deterioration which the man who is not completely used to the pit may not appreciate and possibly may not understand. But every mining engineer, foreman, overman and deputy knows that there is no mystery about the pit at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be a lack of calculation about movements of strata and that sort of thing, but in the ordinary daily working of the mine there is no mystery at all. Most of these things are of daily occurrence, as my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton, with his expert knowledge, will tell the Minister. They are happening every day and are not mysteries at all. Therefore, whoever advised the Minister to put in this Clause made a serious mistake. I would urge on the Minister that what we want is something concrete, and not just a kind word.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Noel-Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we have had a very important debate on Clause 55—a debate on which the fate of the Bill may depend. The Minister is about to make a very important speech, but I wish to say in parenthesis that I am beginning to doubt whether he will get this Bill this Session unless he takes the quarries out of it and puts them in a separate Bill. I think it is very likely that he may find it wise to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the warning which my hon. Friends have given this morning. We are beginning to feel that this Bill embodies standards of safety that are less satisfactory than those of the Act of 1911. As a statement of principle, it is not as good as what we have already got on the Statute Book, and we would rather stick to what we have than take this new version from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends are beginning to feel that the obligations of owners and managers in respect of health and safety are being hedged about with reservations
	<span class='label label-info column'>1278</span>
and escape clauses which ought not to be there at all, or, if there—and sometimes it may be necessary—ought to be phrased in language much more tightly drawn. My hon. Friends are beginning to feel, as so many of them have said, that the duties of the miners are all absolute, but their rights at law are weakened or obliterated by these escape clauses for the owners and managers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am perfectly certain that on the benches opposite there is a feeling that the obscurity of legal drafting—perhaps an inevitable obscurity—is making the matter more difficult for us than it ought to be. I admit that we have not got on our side of the Committee as high a percentage of trained barristers as there is on the other side, but we have on our side a higher percentage not only of men who have worked in the pits but of men who have seen this legislation working in the courts and who therefore understand the points that are going to arise in any legal proceedings which there may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that some of the phrases which we have found unsatisfactory do, in fact, give a stronger protection to the workers than we feel is the case, but we also have the conviction that their use will open the very floodgates of litigation to the great disadvantage of the workers in the pits. Clause 55 is vitally important of itself, because many hon. Members have said that ventilation is the lifeblood of the pit. There have been a great many failures in this matter in the past, and not even the National Coal Board could say that everything is perfect here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and gallant Member for South Fylde has asked what is wrong with the substance of Clause 55 about ventilation. Subsections (1), (2) and (3) as originally drawn by the Minister laid duties on the management, and we did not propose any Amendments to them, but subsection (4) knocked them to smithereens. Let me read to the Committee subsection (4) as originally drafted:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(4) For the purposes of any legal proceedings in which a failure by the manager of a mine to discharge, in relation to the mine, the duty imposed on him by subsection (1) of this section is alleged, there shall be held not to have been such a failure if it is shown—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(
	<i>a</i>) that the ventilation was interrupted or reduced in consequence of accident or breakdown;"</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1279</span>
The accident or breakdown might be entirely due to his negligence or failure to do his duty, and that simply knocks the first three subsections to pieces. We proposed to amend it, and I cannot understand why the Minister did not accept our Amendments. Sometimes in the earlier Clauses of the Bill, the Minister has made explanations which have led me to feel that, perhaps, our Amendments could have been better expressed or that the matter could have been dealt with in some other way, but in this case I can see why our Amendments could not have been accepted as they stood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We wanted to say that there should be held not to have been such a failure if it was shown first,
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the mechanical or other provisions for ventilation were at all times efficiently and adequately maintained;"</p></blockquote>
What can be wrong with that? We wanted to add, at the end of paragraph (
	<i>a</i>), words which would have made the paragraph read as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(
	<i>a</i>) that the ventilation was interrupted or reduced in consequence of accident or breakdown not caused by any neglect or default on his part."</p></blockquote>
What could be wrong with that? I cannot understand why it could not be accepted, and I hope that the Minister will explain his reasons again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, we cannot feel that the draft which was laid before us yesterday is satisfactory for dealing with these major defects in the Clause as originally drafted. Therefore, having tried to reinforce the warning given by my hon. Friends, I would end by asking the Minister to withdraw the whole Clause and to tell us that he will bring back a new draft after he has considered the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to begin by saying to the right hon. Member for Morpeth (Mr. R. J. Taylor), to whom I also listen with such care, that when he talked about the word "foreseen" and his difficulty in regard to that, I have already stated that we will see if we cannot improve these words. I shall have a word or two to say in a moment about our Amendment in which these words occur and the real intention of that, which bears on what the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Mr. Noel-Baker)
	<span class='label label-info column'>1280</span>
said. I should like to tell the hon. Member for Houghton-le-Spring (Mr. Blyton) that I am advised that on the question of inbye fans working during the weekend, in this Clause they must work during the week-end. I am glad to give him that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the question of the difficulty about the qualified and unqualified duties, and whether certain duties are put on the manager which are different from those put on the workmen, or that we are approaching these two classes of people working in the mines in a different spirit. The question of whether a duty is unqualified or not is not approached by us from the point of view of whom that duty falls upon, or has to be discharged by, but of the nature of the duty itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that in any particular case it is reasonable that the duty should be absolute, or that, in common sense, the duty should be qualified in a reasonable way. That being the principle, hon. Members will, I know, appreciate, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Grinstead (Colonel Clarke) did, the point, which, I think, was put very cogently by the hon. Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Bishop), that by the very nature of the position of managers and workmen, the duties of the workmen in most cases are duties which he himself can carry out and which are within his own control, because, obviously, his duties are simpler than those of the manager who has to control not only the pit, the workmen and all the junior officials of the pit, but has other duties for the carrying out of which he has to rely on many people to co-operate with him. It is because of that human factor which entering in, that, although the principle in which the matter is approached is quite the same, it is more often that the manager's duties have, in common sense, to be qualified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to the question raised about the escape clauses and the general question of qualification. I must again remind the Committee of the 1911 Act, which the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. B. Taylor) held up as something which was very good and a model of clarity. We have to remember that in one single subsection of a Clause in the 1911 Act there is more qualification done—because it qualifies everything in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1281</span>
whole Act—than in the 20, 30, or 40 more restricted qualifications, which apply only to particular points. It was in order to reduce the number of qualifications—and this point was made strongly by the National Union of Mineworkers—that we took out that general qualifying Section and decided to confine it in relation to particular duties. In this matter there was even an extra qualification in the 1911 Act itself. All that it said was that there would not be any contravention if it were shown that the ventilation was interrupted in consequence of an accident.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. R. Williams</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister is not suggesting that the National Union of Mineworkers made representations to include these qualifications. I take it that what he means is that they wanted Section 102 (8) out?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, I was merely saying that we have done this in an endeavour to meet that point of view, and I wanted to demonstrate clearly that although the phrase "reasonably practicable" appears more often in this Bill, it is, in fact, more restricted than in one single appearance in the 1911 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a general qualification in the 1911 Act with regard to ventilation and we have particular qualifications in the 1911 Act, in addition, with regard to ventilation, whereas here the qualifications are much more stringent. It is not merely the ones in paragraphs (
	<i>a</i>), (
	<i>b</i>) and (
	<i>c</i>), but the manager has to do every single one of them before he gets his escape clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here again it is easy to be misunderstood. The right hon. Gentleman referred to his own Amendment and he said, for example, what is in the present Clause, that if the ventilation was interrupted or resumed in consequence of an accident or breakdown, that accident or breakdown could have been due to the negligence of the manager. The purpose of his own Amendment was to deal with that point, which exists in the 1911 Act. That is also the purpose of our Amendment. If hon. Members will look at it for a moment—I will not say without unprejudiced eyes, but seeing what we are trying to get at, they will see that it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…to be adequate for the purposes mentioned…by reason…of an event which
	<span class='label label-info column'>1282</span>
could not reasonably…be foreseen or, if foreseen, could not reasonably…be provided against."</p></blockquote>
Our intention was to make quite clear that there was a proper duty on the manager which he would have to perform, and that before he got any escape he would have to show that he had done his very best to keep the machine in proper order and that any failure was not due to negligence to maintain the machine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was for that reason that I suggested that all the Amendments concerned with this problem should be left on one side for the bigger thing, because they were really trying to do the very same thing. I think that hon. Members will see that, although they may not agree with the Clause, when. I took the line I did last night, it was not through some emergence of the spirit of evil in me which led me to propose what I thought was a bargain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should, perhaps, say a word or two on the issue of damages. The position there is that under this Bill damages will be claimable in a court of law. Using a layman's phrase, damages will be obtainable if negligence is proved. That would be the case not only with regard to the Amendment but everything else. It is a general principle of the law of England that one cannot claim damages unless negligence is shown to exist. I do not know whether hon. Members opposite wanted to establish a different principle, but, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General said, to establish something different and to take a different attitude on this point would be going far beyond the confines of this Bill and doing something which would be changing the law of England in principle. That is a position which I cannot take up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the question of ventilation, I think that the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. A. Roberts) was quite fair when he said that there had been good progress made in ventilation in the mines during the last 20 years. What I think the Committee has not appreciated or dwelt sufficiently upon is that, while there has been good progress made in ventilation, there is still one very important matter which requires to be improved further, and that is the matter which, in fact, has caused the majority of explosions in pits in recent years—the accumulation of dangerous gases in waste or disused workings. Most of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1283</span>
explosions in recent years have not been due to the failure of the ordinary standard of ventilation, because that has been going very well; but they have been due either to a fall of baromatic pressure or a fall of rock or stone in the disused workings forcing out accumulations of gases which have not been noticed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the 1911 Act, there is no obligation for the ventilation of these disused workings. In the existing state of the law, which hon. Members opposite, I think, are ill-advisedly holding up to us as a model in this matter of ventilation, we have something which ought to be changed and improved. In this Clause we do so. We say that either the disused workings shall have proper ventilation so that they cease to have any inflammable gas, or they shall be stopped up. That is a very big improvement. I think that hon. Members will agree that this is a very important matter and that it is very satisfactory that we should be making such a large advance in this matter of the prevention of explosions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the accumulation of fire damp, the incidence of explosions in the last few years, in spite of the greatly increased number of shots fired, has been reduced. It is not only a matter of there being a fall in the barometric pressure, but sometimes it is a question of not taking proper precautions in firing when fire-damp is present, and, of course, in firing we may get separation in the stones or rocks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. The point I am making is this. Whereas we are all delighted to have a great reduction in the number of explosions that have taken place in recent years compared with earlier periods, it has thrown up the fact that one of the great remaining dangers is the accumulation of fire-damp in the waste, and we are seeking to deal with that by a novel and extremely stringent obligation which is laid upon the owners and which, I think, everyone will be in favour of. We want to make what I hope will be quite notable progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one further matter which I should like to mention. I was rather hurt by the charges levelled against me by the hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. D. Griffiths) who is usually so fair. He said that he was surprised that I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1284</span>
was not conciliatory in meeting hon. Members opposite. I do not think that would be the general view. He went on to say that I hope to make so many changes in the Bill that they would be too heavy to deal with on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. D. Griffiths</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to infer that, and if I did, I am sorry. I know that the right hon. Gentleman had given way, although not as much as we would have liked, and I said that I thought that he was taking too many things back which he would be unable to consider in the circumstances on the Report stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I misunderstood the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member for Wigan (Mr. R. Williams) said earlier, "Cannot the right hon. Gentleman just look at this?" When I say I am going to look at something, it is not just looking; it means that there is a presumption that I hope to be able to do something; and, therefore, when I have given these undertakings I have only done so after consideration. I have never permitted myself to say that unless I had a definite hope that I would find a way out which would be satisfactory to hon. Members opposite. It would be depreciating the currency of such assurances unless that was the attitude I took, and that is why I cannot give assurances too easily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has genuinely been my desire to do everything I can to meet the point of view of hon. Members opposite, while, at the same time, having the very considerable advice and experience behind me of the Department in these matters. I should like to point out that in this Clause not only are we making a very considerable advance, to which I have drawn attention this morning, but the Clause will, I think, meet hon. Members opposite in their anxiety with regard to the minima laid down in the 1911 Act, and I assure them that I hope to be able to do something about that on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Harold Finch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put one point because reference has been made to Section 102 (8) of the 1911 Act. Does the principle of absolute liability apply in this Bill as it does in the 1911 Act? That is the contention between us.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1285</span>
The right hon. Gentleman says that we are not doing anything to deprive workmen of any damages in the case of negligence, but under the 1911 Act we have no need to prove negligence in order to obtain a claim for damages where there is an unsafe method of working. We are worried because this Clause seems to deprive the workmen of the right to claim damages where a person is injured and where there is an unsafe method of working.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member's intuition is working correctly this morning. What I was proposing to the Committee was instead of placing so many qualifications and conditions to be fulfilled before an inspector can take action with regard to a requirement that there should be an improvement, I was proposing that it would be better if it were done in the general considerations of the inspector. It would be nonsense to require him to do all these things. The record would

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blyton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment deals with the question of ventilation. We want to lay down that there are to be supplementary means of ventilation for mechanical apparatus like large fans, and also shafts where ventilation is not obtained by natural means, in the event of the mechanical methods breaking down.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 41, line 20, after "fire," to insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or compressed air."</p></blockquote>
We want to raise this question of compressed air because we know from our experience that on occasions where there has been gas in a place compressed air has been added and the gas has been diluted not by natural means or by ordinary ventilation but by the compressed air pipes. We want it put in the Bill that this kind of method, which we know goes on, ought to be stopped, because it is bad pit practice. We do not mean to stop compressed air driving fans or being used for other mechanical purposes that help ventilation, but we want to stop diluting inflammable gas by these methods. The reason we want this put in the Bill is so there will be no ambiguity about the matter and those responsible will know that these practices are controlled by the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are absolutely in sympathy with the object of the hon. Member, but we cannot accept the Amendment because we know, as everybody knows, that compressed air is needed for certain things. It is required for a certain kind of power and so on. There is one matter of a scientific character which must give us some cause for hesitation. When we were considering the question of the hot mines the other day, there was reference to a possible scientific and technical development by which compressed air might be used for cooling effect, which is not direct ventilation. That is not done at the moment, but it is possible that it will be done in the future, and we would not want to prevent some progress of that kind which we might do if we inserted these words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to define and make quite sure that compressed air should be used for its proper use and not used improperly. We are very anxious to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1953-1954V001P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1289</span>
prevent that, but we feel that this matter is so complicated that it is better dealt with in regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Neal</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister intend to prevent the irregular and unauthorised use of compressed air?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noel-Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What about the case the Minister referred to of compressed air being used not for ventilation but for cooling?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be used half and half.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. T. Brown</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to say a word on this, because the Minister appears to be somewhat concerned about the words in the Clause. We want it laid down in the Bill that compressed air is not to be used for ventilation purposes. There is the question of cooling, and it may be very desirable to cool a place, but I have always taken it as bad pit practice to use compressed air for the removal of obnoxious gases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was taught that in my early days, but a practice has developed of driving a heading with a pneumatic pick driven by compressed air, and in that heading the man is face to face with an accumulation of gas. He may be tempted to use compressed air to remove the gas, but it is bad pit practice and it is not common sense. Therefore, we are anxious that there should be something in this Bill to prohibit the use of compressed air for removing that gas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Compressed air is sometimes used in a venturi tube to some good purpose. The hon. Member for Ince (Mr. T. Brown) has pointed out that it is bad pit practice to wipe out fire damp or any other gas by compressed air. First, there is always a danger of static electricity and, secondly, it is laid down that the ventilation shall be such as to render it harmless. If compressed air is used for driving coal cutters, boring machines or pneumatic picks, the Clause will not be sufficient as it stands. I hope the Minister is taking note of what I am saying, because these Amendments may sometimes give an impression to hon. Gentlemen opposite that we do not know what we are talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1290</span>
If the Minister can give us something in place of this Amendment that will give us what we are after, I say on my own responsibility that I think the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Neal) and the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Mr. Noel-Baker) will be satisfied. We want to prevent workmen using compressed air to remove CH

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be absolutely frank with the Committee. We are entirely in favour of getting rid of bad practice and the wrong use of compressed air, but we do not want to put something in the Bill which would prevent the good use of compressed air. The Amendment might even prevent a compressed air engine being used for ventilation. Those are the troubles we get into when we have to write an Act of Parliament, but I will see if I can find a way of prohibiting this practice in the Bill. I have taken certain advice, I have been told that it is exceedingly difficult and that we are not at all sure that we shall succeed. So this is an assurance on a rather different basis from my previous ones, because usually when I say that I will look at a question, it means that we can do it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Fuel and Power (Mr. L. W. Joynson-Hicks)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a reasonably practicable hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, as my hon. Friend says, it is a reasonably practicable hope. I will try, but there are real difficulties in the drafting of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. A. Roberts</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister has difficulty, will he consult this side of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Lloyd</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Most certainly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Blyton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister that we are not trying to prohibit compressed air going into the venturi tube and we are not trying to stop the use of compressed air engines. We are trying to ensure that where there is not sufficient ventilation to dilute the inflammable gas, the practice of diluting it with compressed air will be stopped. Since the Minister is prepared to look at it and see if he can meet us on this point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
