	<section>

	<div class='title'>OFFICIAL REPORT</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Teaching Council (Scotland) Bill the Committee do meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at half-past Ten o'clock.—
	<i>[Mrs. Hart.]</i></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the first Amendment, I would draw to the attention of the Committee the fact that there is a Financial Resolution in connection with this Bill which is available in the Committee Room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I should like to say a word or two about Amendments. Adequate notice should be given of any Amendment proposed. There are a number of starred Amendments on the Notice Paper and we may, in the course of our meetings, receive manuscript Amendments. The disadvantage of such Amendments is that they give inadequate opportunity for Members of the Committee to study them before the Committee meets. I shall use my discretion whether or not to call starred or manuscript Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Myer Galpern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if there could be some consideration given to there being a wider interval of-time between the selection of Members to serve on the Committee and the calling of the first meeting? The time has been rather short. If Members could be given a longer notice, they would have better opportunity to consider Amendments. I did not know until last Friday that I was to sit on this Committee. The time available to Members to submit or study Amendments is rather short. I wonder whether attention could be given to our having longer notice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for his remark, which, I am sure, will be taken note of in the appropriate quarter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for perpetrating several of the starred
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Amendments. I think it only fair to say that those Amendments were posted to the Public Bill Office last Thursday. I hope that that fact will be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Clause 1 ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>

	<section>

	<div class='title'>Clause 2.—(STANDARDS FOR ENTRY TO THE TEACHING PROFESSION.)</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 16, to leave out "standards of education" and to insert" educational qualifications and".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee that with the first Amendment we should also discuss Amendments 2, 5, 10 and 11 in the right hon. Gentleman's name:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In page 1, line 16, leave out "and fitness to teach"; in line 19, leave out "those standards" and insert "educational qualifications and training"; in page 2, line 3, leave out "education" and insert "educational qualifications and"; in line 4, leave out "and fitness to teach".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If anyone objects to their being taken together they can be taken separately.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The experience which we have had in the past has often been spending almost the whole of the first morning on Clause 1 of a Bill, but in this case the Committee has been right to pass rapidly over Clause 1 and get down to the more important parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of these two sets of Amendments is the same: to avoid confusion and doubt at later stages. The purpose behind the words which are the subject of these Amendments is reasonably clear, but we have had experience in other cases where things which were clear enough to Members of the Committee on a Bill often became the subject of considerable debate, argument and friction when a few years later the particular words concerned came to be interpreted. It is my opinion, and that of several of my hon. Friends, that the expression "standards of education", though reasonably clear in its meaning, could indeed lead to those sorts of doubts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0121">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
What in fact do "standards of education" mean? They obviously can vary considerably from one part of the country to another, from one school to another, and so on. If somebody at a later stage complained that the Council had not taken proper account of his standards of education there could be a good deal of confusion and doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For this reason I would suggest to the Committee and to the hon. Lady who is in charge of the Bill this morning that she should agree to substitute the phrase "educational qualifications", which would mean that this doubt would to a great extent be removed. Then the educational qualifications could be laid down in a way which everybody could understand—so many passes in the appropriate examination, such and such a degree, or whatever it might be. It would clear the air and make it easier for the Council to be seen to be using consistent standards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second Amendment raises a similar important point. The words used in the Clause are "fitness to teach". I am not quite certain what the hon. Lady may have in mind in using that phrase. Does she, perhaps, mean that "fitness to teach" in this sense means that the teacher has a certificate so that he or she is entitled to teach? If so, then perhaps this expression might be better used. But once one comes to an expression like "fitness to teach", one gets down to purely personal qualities, ones which can be and often are the subject of considerable debate. It is at least open to two interpretations, one by the headmaster and one by the children who are taught, as to whether the person concerned is fit to teach them or not. Perhaps that is taking it to the extreme, but it is none the less true that when one is laying on the Council the duty of keeping under review standards of education, training, and fitness to teach, it is laying on the Council a task which I am not certain is really the Council's job if by "fitness to teach" we mean all sorts of personal qualities—religious views, political views, capability of keeping order in class, and other things. Therefore, it would be of benefit to this Bill, and I think would be the wish of many Members of the Committee, if we were to clarify what we mean, thereby, perhaps, saving a great deal of argument at later stages when the Council comes
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to discuss these points in relation to individual teachers. These are small points, but they are important ones.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has raised some interesting points. Definition is always a problem. It does not matter what occupation one is dealing with. One may criticise the term "standards of education", which seems to me to be a not euphonious phrase, though one cannot judge merely on sound effects. Personally, I like "educational qualifications" better than "standards of education". But if we drop "standards of education" and substitute "education qualifications", then what advance do we make in understanding? Just as standards vary, so do qualifications vary just as much. I do not know what step forward we have made in defining those qualities which go to make up a teacher and to enable a person to teach. The phrase "fitness to teach" is also one which is of tremendous importance, and yet again is something which one cannot adequately define in a Bill by any manipulation of any given form of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday a young lady who had been teaching in one of Glasgow's prominent secondary schools returned lo the university. She was endowed with all the qualifications which a teacher ought to have; she had a degree, and had been trained so as to fit in to the requirements of subsection (2) of this Clause. Yet she went in front of a class of girls aged 15 and found that control of the girls was something quite beyond her. The girls knew it immediately. So, after many heartbreaking days, she realised that, apart from the academic qualifications which are necessary, there is that qualification which can never really be tested till the qualified person is faced with the problem of teaching the boys and girls whom she has been certified to teach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not unusual. I do not say that the examples are numerous, but I myself once had a woodwork teacher who came in under a special scheme which allowed persons with certain qualifications to be ' taken on as teachers. For woodworking, he could not have been better qualified; what he did not know about woodworking was not worth knowing. At the end of his first day I said to him, "How did you find things? Do you like the job?" "Oh", he said, "I wish I had
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0122">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
known about this years ago—this is money for nothing." I said, "I hope that is always your view." At the end of the week I asked him into my room aid said, "What do you feel about your class? "He said, "I wish I had some of these boys as apprentices on the job. I would be able to deal with them as I want to."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He was qualified in the sense that he had all the attainments which appeared to be necessary. He was able to control the apprentices who worked with him on the job. He had all the necessary knowledge. Yet, when placed in front of a class, his only idea was that the one thing he lacked was the physical power to put boys in the place where he would have put them. In other words, fitness to teach was shown to be entirely lacking. I am sure that some of my colleagues could give similar examples.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It all boils down to defining, or trying to define, or finding a form of words which will enable use to define, what is almost indefinable. Even if "fitness to teach" is deleted, I cannot think that any form of words or any juggling with words would improve matters. I would prefer "educational qualifications, training and fitness to teach". I cannot think of any form of words which will be better than "fitness to teach".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cynic may argue that teachers can show their value only in the experiential sense. It may be argued that we should wait and see how a teacher manages to fit himself into what we recognise is a very difficult environment, even if he has the highest qualifications. I remember another case of someone who left Glasgow University with a first class honours degree. A month of teaching sent him back to the University. One would have said that, if anyone was qualified, he was. I believe that he became very distinguished in Scottish life in later years, but evidently he was not fit to teach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a sufficient difference between the meaning of these phrases to justify discussion. They are quite capable of being given entirely different interpretations. One can visualise a situation in which a person had been given a certain standard of education without having educational qualifications
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
as they are generally understood. It is a question of deciding what is desirable. Should we have people entering the profession who require to sit some examination, whether it be for a degree or some other kind of examination, before they are allowed to teach, or can the Council in its wisdom accept people who may have had education up to a standard without having acquired any kind of qualification by examination? This is an important point. I hope that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will clarify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that "fitness to teach" is probably a good form of words to express something which is rather difficult to contain within words, because "fitness to teach" must imply fitness to be a teacher in the first instance. These words must imply an individual's ability to teach, and physical fitness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) has expressed the point of view which I hold. Those who have had considerable concern about what it would be out of order to discuss in detail now, what qualifications a teacher should have, would greatly prefer the Bill to have as great a clarification in the early Clauses as possible. If we leave the Clause as it stands, with "standards of education", we shall allow a greater margin for discussion about what standards of education should be. "Educational qualifications" would make it clearer and would simplify the requirement. It may be easy for us here to envisage standards which would be acceptable as standards of education, but it is much more arguable in the realms of those equally concerned with teaching but less familiar with the detail of argument which we use here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Under-Secretary's view, do the words "educational qualifications" imply holding a degree? I should think that it is likely that it would be agreed that they imply holding a degree. In view of later Clauses, it would be, perhaps, a wise move to put in this implication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am perhaps more concerned about the expression "fitness to teach". Those who have had difficulties in the past with discipline by teachers know that the question of discipline frequently arises, as I think the hon. Lady will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0123">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
agree, on the very question of fitness to teach. Many of the difficulties start with a lack of fitness to teach, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) said. In borderline cases, where an authority responsible must determine whether a teacher should continue, the rules of discipline which apply and, which we shall discuss later, do not always cover the problems. The problems are embraced in personal qualities and outlook, as the hon. Member for Govan has outlined. It would be definitely unwise to retain the expression "fitness to teach". This implies someone's judgment and personal standards. This, in turn, gives rise to the question, whose judgment and whose personal standards? Some of us would agree that it would be difficult to arrive at a common view on this, certainly not one measured by a slide rule. As the purpose of argument at this stage is to clarify what is contained in the Bill, I very much hope that the hon. Lady will feel disposed to look favourably on these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Clause contains three important stages in the life of a prospective teacher. In the first stage, the Council will lay down the standards of education—that is, the basic, prerequisite, educational qualifications for candidates for admission to training colleges. If I am correct in this view, I agree with the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) that it would probably be wiser to substitute "educational qualifications" for "standards of education".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thinking particularly of students coming from abroad. This problem used to arise in the old days on the provincial committees. We had to decide whether we could accept a student on the basis of his proffered qualifications. We had to make extensive inquiries and sometimes we had to decide that the qualifications were not up to the basic requirements for teaching in Scotland. This is why I believe that it would be safer to accept the first Amendment. The training of teachers will be the most important part, whereby the Council will indicate to colleges of education the content of the curriculum for teachers. I do not have any quarrel on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Argyll wishes to delete the expression "fitness to teach". I disagree with him on this
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
point. As my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) said, difficulties sometimes arise in classes. This is not the fault of the teaching college, nor of the individual. During their period of training students undergo practical teaching experience in schools. They are under the supervision of masters who are there for the express purpose of seeing how the prospective teacher conducts himself in front of a class. At the end of the day, if the authority takes the view that the individual is incapable of maintaining discipline, it is not unknown for the award of a certificate to be withheld, purely on the ground that the individual is not fit to teach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great difficulty arises on the question of the award of the parchment. After the completion of training, there is a period when a teacher is serving a period of probation. It is important that the teacher should be able to satisfy the examiners as to his fitness to teach. A very important part in the life of a teacher is his post-college of education days when he is qualified. It is essential that the new Council should be given the power, acting on reports collated and opinions expressed indicating a certain line of failure in front of a class, to withhold the parchment. The Council should be empowered to prescribe certain levels of attainment to this end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would be a difficult matter, I agree. We can hardly lay down regulations saying that a teacher must show this, that or the other. On the other hand, the personal conduct of a teacher, apart from his teaching qualifications, can come into question. He may enter a college and train as a teacher and it may afterwards be found that he has been guilty of some misdemeanour at some time. Something may leak out and his personal conduct in the class may come into question. I believe that it is therefore most important that the words "fitness to teach" be retained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened with care to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern). There was a great deal of wisdom in what they had to say, but to some extent they misunderstood the purpose of the Amendment. "Fitness to teach" is an essential quality in deciding whether a person should be a teacher, but it is impossible for the Council or any other body to lay down standards of fitness to teach. This is a purely personal matter to be decided in each case. The hon. duced the right solution when he suggested that this was something to be decided when considering whether the parchment should be given after there had been some practical experience of the person concerned as a teacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We cannot lay down standards for consideration, but if the inspector reported adversely on some aspect of the teacher's conduct before a class, that should be sufficient for the Council to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: An individual may be a fit person to be a teacher, but that can be decided only by experience of him as a teacher. During the war, the Services had a similar problem in connection with the selection of officers. Everybody connected with the selection of officers for the Armed Services knew what officer-like qualities were, but, although many attempts were made to define them, there was no success. Everybody knows what is required in the way of fitness to teach, but I do not think that anybody, however wise, can lay down in advance how such a quality should be defined. The Amendment would leave the inspectors to decide at the time whether the person concerned had that quality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mrs. Judith Hart)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be convenient to the Committee if at this point I make clear some of the thoughts which were in our minds when we drafted the Bill in this way. Although many of the arguments from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have been very persuasive I must make it clear that we feel that it is essential to keep the wording of the Clause as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
To take the arguments in turn. First, "standards of education". It is interesting to note that the Wheatley Report—which we have followed in the drafting of the Bill wherever possible—in paragraph 7, dealing with the powers and functions of the Council, uses a number of phrases—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the determination of standards of qualifications for entrants to training … the standards to be required … standards of admission … entrance standards".</p></blockquote>
The Wheatley Committee showed no particular inclination to restrict itself to "educational qualifications", or to anything which could not be best summarised in these words, "standards of education". That, of course, is a wider definition than "educational qualifications", but it is to be preferred because it is an inclusive term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must make it clear that it will be for the Council to decide how to determine the standards of education which it regards as necessary for various purposes. In other words, it will have to determine the educational qualifications which measure up to the standards of education which it regards as necessary. We are giving the Council the responsibility of deciding what educational qualifications measure up to the standards which it selects as suitable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is important, because in our discussion of these Amendments we are dealing with fundamental attitudes to the whole Bill and the whole concept behind it. We are discussing the relationship between the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the powers and the duties of the Council itself. What the Bill proposes to do is to arrive at a correct apportionment of functions between the two. In using this wider definition of "standard of education" we are clearly imposing on the Council a responsibility which we believe that it will take seriously, while recognising the realities of the situation which will face it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The passage in the Wheatley Report mentioned by the hon. Lady refers to "standards of qualification". Those are rather different from "standards of education". This is the point we have tried to make in the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What I was trying to explain was that in this part of its Report the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0125">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Wheatley Committee used several phrases which had only one thing in common, the word "standards", not the word "qualifications".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, that is so, but the Wheatley Committee was not producing a Bill, but speaking in general terms. The hon. Lady should try to explain to the Committee what difference she sees in the Council deciding on the standards of qualifications which make up the standards of education and accepting our Amendment which enables the Council to do exactly that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In our view, the Bill gives the Council functions which should correctly be those of the Council. The Amendment would require the Council to keep under review the educational qualifications and training required for registration and to make such recommendations to the Secretary of State about educational qualifications and training as it thought fit. As I have tried to show, the expression "standards of education" was deliberately chosen to give the Council fairly wide scope in considering the requirements which it would recommend in terms of the kind of education which a person should have as a preparation for becoming a teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the right hon. Gentleman is trying to do is to accept the Bill while keeping all the powers to the Secretary of State, powers which the Bill seeks to give to the Council. He must be quite clear about his motives in this. Either he accepts that we have reached the point when teachers have a right to have self-government in those matters which they should correctly determine and for the Secretary of State to give them powers which it is correct that they should exercise, while retaining to himself the overall responsibility for education in Scotland, or he must reject that, which is what he is doing in his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has nothing to do with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has everything to do with it, because in support of his Amendment the right hon. Gentleman is saying that our phraseology gives the Council a wider degree of power and responsibility than he thinks suitable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend lays down standards, everybody will
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
have to conform to them. There will be many occasions when it will be difficult to equate these educational qualifications to those of someone coming from New Zealand or from Jamaica. Provincial committees have spent hours trying to equate the qualifications of teachers from abroad to those required by the teaching profession in Scotland. Would it not be far better to leave the provision broader, so that when these odd cases arise which do not strictly conform to the standards we could consider the educational qualifications required and then judge the cases on their merits? In such circumstances "educational qualifications" would be a better phrase than "standards of education".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only wanted to ask whether or not my hon. Friend agrees that if the words "training qualifications" were inserted the effect would be directly opposite to that suggested by my hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a certain amount of merit in that. The exceptional case, such as that mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) would be dealt with under Clause 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It remains true that "standards of education" is the broad term within which the Council can define the educational qualifications which it requires, and these will be embodied in regulations to be made under the Bill. It is not that the regulations will lay down standards of education. They will lay down educational qualifications which will be defined by the Council in terms of the power which this Clause 2 gives the Council to determine standards of education. It is because this is a more inclusive term that it seems to my right hon. Friend and to myself to be a better phrase. It clearly expresses the degree of responsibility which one intends the Council to exercise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are now to have a situation in which standards of education have to be laid down and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0126">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
educational qualifications will still persist, but those educational qualifications may or may not measure up to the standards of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is under a slight misapprehension. Subsection (1) of the Clause says that it shall be the duty of the Council to keep standards of education under review—not to make regulations but to keep under review, The power to make regulations, which will relate more specifically to educational qualifications, comes later, although it is derived from this Clause, This subsection is fundamental to defining the extent of the Council's responsibility. To the extent that one limits it and uses terms which are exclusive rather than inclusive, one limits the responsibilities and powers of the Council, which is what we do not want to do. We wish to establish the full extent of the duties and responsibilities of the General Teaching Council and not limit them by using more restrictive phrases than we have used.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next argument concerns "fitness to teach". It is intended by these words to cover both the physical and other aspects of health, for one thing, of the prospective teacher. It is fundamental to the argument that if these words were excluded there would be no power under regulations for the Secretary of State to exclude anyone from entering the teaching profession, other than on qualifications, the results of examinations, the results of his training course. Although it is a situation more often found in the past and not likely to be common in future, there would be no power, if the Amendment were accepted, to exclude the prospective teacher who had tuberculosis, the teacher with a contagious disease, the teacher who would be a danger to health. Regulations can be made, as the Bill stands, which would not permit a teacher, who might threaten the health of the children, to teach. If the phrase is excluded, we are left with only the standards of education and training and we could do nothing about the physical or even the mental health of a teacher.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hon. Member mentioned discipline in class and my hon. Friend the Member for Shettleston rightly pointed out that this was the sort of thing which Her
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Majesty's Inspector would keep his eye on during a probation period. The capacity of a teacher to control a class and the ability of a teacher to teach are rather different from the fitness of the teacher and are matters which would arise during the probation period and they are not under consideration now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Miss Harvie Anderson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. Lady agree that the question of physical health emerges through the superannuation scheme, even in cases where a teacher is not superannuated? In all cases the local authority responsible for education has some scheme particularly designed to deal with all aspects of physical health. In any case, in practice, it would not come under a phrase such as this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, it would. It is never a good thing to evade one's duties under one piece of legislation by referring to residual powers in other legislation, In any Bill one must say what one means, and in this Bill we feel that it is necessary to state that among the considerations which the Teaching Council may take into account in deciding what recommendations to make to the Secretary of State, and in making regulations to admit people to the teaching profession, physical health should be capable of being included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At an earlier stage the hon. Lady asked how one would define fitness to teach. She indicated, quite rightly, that it was difficult to put into writing in regulations the personal qualities which are required of a teacher. One of her hon. Friends then pointed out that in this country we are familiar with selecting people for various jobs, such as officers for the Army, staff for the Civil Service, and so on. It is clearly understood that the personal interview by one or more people is a way of determining quite a number of things about a person. It is for the Council to decide what methods it wishes to use, and I come back to the point that if one is approaching the Bill with an attitude that seeks to limit, to constrict, and to constrain the Council in what it may do, and how it may make its decisions, one is revealing a reluctance to give to the Council the responsibility which the Bill is seeking to give to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to end the discussion on these Amendments. I wish at this stage
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0127">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
merely to make it clear why we feel that it is essential to maintain the phrasing in the Clause, and to make it clear that the form of words in subsection (1) expresses the attitude to the Council, and the responsibilities of the Council, which my right hon. Friend and we as a Government seek to express in bringing forward this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. N. R. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Lady has properly pointed out, the point at issue here is the choice of words in an Act of Parliament. After all, it is one thing to publish a Report, as Lord Wheatley did, naturally, in general terms, but another to translate those recommendations into an Act of Parliament which may be subject to the scrutiny of the courts. Whatever the Government's intentions may be at any time, unless those intentions are translated into a proper drafting they may be frustrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries my right hon. and hon. Friends and myself, and, I think, some hon. Gentlemen opposite, too, is that the form of wording here is not appropriate to an Act of Parliament, because it is in far too general terms. I accept that the Council must have in mind standards of education; I accept that the Secretary of State must have in mind standards of education; and after all, what is being criticised here can apply equally to Clause 7, which we have not reached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To deal with the point made by the hon. Lady about restricting the powers of the Council, and blowing up the powers of the Secretary of State, the criticisms on this Clause apply equally to Clause 7. What are these criticisms basically? They are simply, how can one 
	<i>ab ante</i> make recommendations, or how can the Secretary of State in advance make regulations on so vague a concept as standards of education? Suppose it should happen that those regulations were challenged—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman refers to Clause 7 he will see that the regulations to be made under that Clause do not refer to standards of education. It prescribes the requirements as to education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Lady. I had in mind fitness to teach,
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
because that aspect is even graver than standards of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose recommendations are challenged, or the regulations are challenged, and it is said that it is not known what is meant by "standards of education". I can see fearful difficulties arising when this is examined under a magnifying glass in court, and I am sure that nobody wants that to happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see how anything is lost by defining more closely the powers under subsection (1). It is not only a responsibility to keep under review, but a responsibility also to make recommendations and what I am concerned about it whether recommendations can be made on such a vague concept as standards of education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the hon. Lady really has in mind is what we have submitted in the Amendments. She really has in mind educational qualifications, because, as hon. Members have said, educational qualifications can be defined in precise terms, and the recommendations embodying educational qualifications can be defined in precise terms. I am concerned about the vagueness of the Clause's phraseology. To use my right hon. Friend's words, it is too nebulous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the words "fitness to teach" are most inappropriate in an Act of Parliament of this nature. What constitutes fitness to teach? The hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) put it very neatly when he said that this was an attempt to define something which is indefinable. There must be a residual power in the selecting body to decide in an individual case whether the person concerned is fit to teach, and there is that power under Clause 6(2,
	<i>c</i>). What I cannot envisage are regulations or recommendations being made in advance as to what constitutes fitness to teach. How is it to be done? Will it be done on a negative basis in the regulations or recommendations? Will they say, "The following categories of persons will not be suitable to teach: those who suffer from tuberculosis; those who are unable to maintain class discipline; those who drink to excess; those who beat their wives"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will this be tackled? This applies to the Secretary of State as well. It is not a question of distinguishing the powers of the one from the other. The Secretary of State is invited to make regulations as to fitness to teach. Quite frankly, I do not see how it is possible to deal with so general a concept either by regulations or by recommendations, and for that reason I strongly submit that these words "fitness to teach" should be left out, because I am sure that if an attempt is made to exercise powers of recommendation, or powers of making regulations on the basis of such a general concept, we shall run into trouble in the courts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has painted a frightening picture. I should have thought that the regulations governing the things he has mentioned, fitness to teach, entry into colleges, and so on, were extant. They are all there. The standards are already laid down. Unless I have misunderstood the spirit and purpose of the Bill, its intention is not to give power to alter such regulations and conditions. We are setting up a General Teaching Council for Scotland and asking it to keep things under review for the purposes of better teaching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill does not say that the Council must incorporate in its recommendations everything which is extant in the colleges of education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The words are quite clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was slightly puzzled by what the hon. Gentleman was trying to put to the Committee. He seemed to be saying that we were setting up this new Council but it could not do anything, and it could not change anything, because everything was already arranged. That seems a most extraordinary argument. That may not be what he meant, but that is what he said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I said that. I said that there were in existence known standards for entry to colleges, such as fitness to teach, and so on. These are known to the teaching
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
profession, and Parliament has laid them down. The right hon. Gentleman has had to administer these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main purpose of the Bill is to give the teachers a greater say and influence in matters, and to give the Council the power to review and to make recommendations for changes, but any substantial changes, or any hard and fast proposals, will still require consideration by the Secretary of State and by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be the duty of the Council to keep under review standards not only of education, but of training and of fitness to teach required of persons entering the teaching profession. The Council will be required to make recommendations, as it thinks fit, to the Secretary of State. The Council is not given power to alter regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that my hon. Friend is right in her argument. It seems to me—and I hesitate to use the word—that this Committee is arrogating unto itself the power to lay down in detail the qualifications and standards required for entry into the profession. This is not the purpose of the Bill. In view of the arguments which I have heard, I am wondering whether, as there seems to be so much misunderstanding of the whole situation, we shall be sorry that the Bill was given a Second Reading. I would be satisfied with the words as they stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that I disagree a great deal with my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan). Big discussions sometimes start from very small beginnings. My intervention was related solely to the particular duties which had to be assigned to the Council. I did not quarrel with the idea that we should retain the provisions about fitness to teach or standards of training. I quarrelled with the usefulness of not changing from "standards of education" to "educational qualifications". Even after my hon. Friend's helpful intervention the distinction between the two phrases seems to me to be only a hair's breadth.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that such a remark is always received in silence, but that silence does not paralyse me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the subsection generally because it gives teachers a passive power to keep matters under review. Whether we decide to keep under review "educational qualifications" or "standards of education" is a matter of taste, and my taste inclines to "educational qualifications".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also welcome the power to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. I challenged this point in my Second Reading speech. In the end, power resides with the Secretary of State. He may or may not accept the recommendations of the Council, because he has the power to make the regulations laying down requirements as to education, training and fitness to teach. Here we have no quarrel about words. We may have a quarrel about the words in Clause 7, because there is no reference there to "educational qualifications" or "standards of education". There is a mere reference to "requirements as to education". When it comes to doing the actual job of laying down regulations permitting the registration of persons who have entered the profession under Clause 2, that simple reference is sufficient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is strange to think that a person can enter the profession under the terms of Clause 2 but that once he has entered he can be registered only under Clause 7. We must wait with patience till we reach Clause 7 before we can know what the exact position is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Having listened to what has been said by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee I am convinced that they are two sensible Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary tried to draw a red herring across the trail when she said that I was seeking to limit the powers of the Council. My hon. Friends and I are
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
trying to do nothing of the sort. The hon. Lady gave the position away completely when she said that the Council will have to make recommendations to the Secretary of State and for that purpose will translate "standards of education" into "educational qualifications". Of course it will. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Wylie) has said, we cannot conceivably make sensible regulations with a phrase as wide and all embracing as "standards of education".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not, as the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr. Hannan) suggested, trying to lay down what educational qualifications the Council should consider; that has not even been mentioned or thought of, at least by hon. Members on this side of the Committee. All that we are trying to do is to help the Council so that it can make recommendations which are sensible and which will avoid the difficulties that can arise. This matter affects the lives of many children in Scotland, and I hope that it will affect a great many more as they come into the teaching profession. They should know exactly where they stand, and the matter can be clearly and simply laid down if we accept the words "educational qualifications".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of the phrase "fitness to teach" has also been referred to by hon. Members on both sides, and has probably been queried by a majority of hon. Members on this side. The hon. Member for Govan and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Shettleston (Sir M. Galpern) made quite clear the quality which we all have in our minds. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) spoke about the problem in connection with the selection of officers. We all know how difficult it is to define this, and that it often becomes apparent that a teacher is or is not fit to teach only after he has had several months' practical teaching. It is not something which can be laid down in regulations or recommendations, except in respect of the one point which the hon. Lady made, namely, health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If she is prepared to alter the wording to "educational qualifications, training and health", at least she has a good point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am surprised to know that there has been any change in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0130">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
physical qualifications. Every teacher has a strenuous medical examination to survive before he is admitted to the profession, and if any physical or functional disorder or disease is discovered, according to my experience, that teacher is recommended not to try to enter the profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree. I was merely picking up the only point made by the hon. Lady in opposition to our belief that the phrase "fitness to teach" should be deleted. If—which might happen in the event of new medical discoveries—the Council wanted to recommend that certain diseases or physical defects should debar teachers from time to time, it might be argued that the deletion of this phrase would mean that the Council would have no powers to make such recommendations to the Secretary of State. That might be so, but it is quite irrelevant to the general thinking behind the Amendments, which is that we should not burden the Council with words which do not limit their powers but which make it almost certain that their decisions will cause trouble, inconvenience, heartburning and all the other things, including, possibly, subsequent law suits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the right hon. Gentleman apply his mind to the question of moral disqualification? If certain facts became known about an applicant, would the right hon. Gentleman leave the situation over till something happened which could be dealt with by the disciplinary machinery, without making a judgment beforehand?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is worried about the same problem as that which worried his hon. Friend. A moral defect might appear in an individual teacher.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: An applicant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When H.M.I. or the local authority heard about it the case could be considered and a decision could be arrived at and action taken accordingly. But this is not the sort of point which can be laid down in regulations. For instance, we cannot bring in a regulation that any married teacher who goes off with some other girl is automatically unfit to teach. We are thinking in terms of indi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
vidual cases where difficulties may arise in connection with laying down categories concerning unfitness to teach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment seeks to take this question out of the general powers of the Council, because we do not believe that it is possible to deal with anything in general terms—except, perhaps, certain questions of health—so as to cover all the individual cases we are thinking about. If this power is given to the Council it will cause difficulty and trouble. It would be much better to ignore this aspect of the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman seemed to be confusing entrance to the profession with steps to be taken after a teacher was already teaching. He was relating his argument to teachers already in the profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It applies to both. I am referring to the first beginnings of a teaching career. The Council is to make recommendations which are to be embodied in regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference. Once a teacher is teaching, many of the things which the right hon. Gentleman is talking about would be matters for the local authority—his employer—to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what I said in reply to the point made by the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson). This is exactly why we do not think that, with the exception of the health question, there is anything in what the hon. Lady said in respect of what the Council needs to recommend before a teacher becomes a teacher. The hon. Lady has talked about health. There is nothing else. The other things appear afterwards, with experience either of a man's life outside school or his behaviour in school. These words would be much better left out at this stage. We can deal with the question whether or not they should come in at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, but I find the arguments of the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. and learned Friend rather unconvincing. Let us consider for a moment the question of moral defects. I would prefer to call them psychological difficulties. Most of us would agree that many moral defects are psychological difficulties. I am not concerned with the powers of the employing authority to deal with a teacher after he is in the job
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0131">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
—it has powers to do that—but I would be very worried to think that anybody with psychological difficulties which made him clearly and eminently unsuitable to be in charge of a class of children, even for two or three months, should be able to enter the profession without somebody—the college authorities, for instance—at some stage having the power to say that that person does not possess the qualities of fitness to teach. It would be difficult to express that in narrower terms than "fitness to teach". The right hon. Gentleman has not suggested any phrase which might adequately take the place of "fitness to teach" and which would would meet the terms of the health qualification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must remember that the regulations themselves will not attempt to set out defined standards and precise definitions of fitness to teach. What they are likely to provide is that students leaving colleges of education must come up to what the college authorities judge to be reasonable in terms of the qualities likely to be of value in a classroom and, negatively, the qualities likely to be harmful in a classroom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) may agree that if the phrase "standards of fitness to teach" were not included the Council would have a duty to keep under review any regulations providing for the quality of education. Should a college of education say, "We do not believe that this student is fit to teach", that college would be exposing itself to possible law suits against it unless it was acting on some regulation which provided for it to have the power to make that judgment of a student in relation to the sort of question which follows from the powers contained in this subsection (1).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are not these discretionary powers precisely the kind of powers narrated in Clause 6(2)? It provides that a person shall be entitled to be registered if
	<br><blockquote><p>"he has been duly recommended by the governing body of a college of education".</p></blockquote>
Then in subsection (2,
	<i>c</i>) we find:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in the case of a person who is not entitled to be registered under either of the two foregoing paragraphs, his education, training, fitness to teach and experience are such as, in the opinion of the Council, to warrant his registration".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
My point is that that is the kind of discretionary power which, over broad considerations and broad terms such as those, is entirely appropriate. The Council has already powers under Clause 6(2,
	<i>c</i>) to exercise discretion in regard to education, training, fitness to teach and experience. I would not quarrel with that because these are discretionary powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hannan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. Is it right that the hon. and learned Gentleman should be able to discuss a later Clause, Clause 6, now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. and learned Member is taking rather too long with his interruption. I would ask him to cut it short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:. It arose out of what the hon. Lady asked me. I was saying that there are discretionary powers in Clause 6(2) which are appropriate to deal with this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we come to deal with Clause 6 we shall find the power relates to the exceptional case and has nothing to do with the matter in hand. I am ready to have another look at this on Report, though I must confess I do not at the moment hold out any high hopes that we shall be able to meet the desires of the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends; but perhaps, with the understanding that we shall do our best to look at it, we might decide to consider the matter again at a later stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One hates looking a gift horse in the mouth, but I would press the hon. Lady a little further. We have made our points from this side of the Committee and the hon. Lady's hon. Friends have made exactly the same points from their side of the Committee. Therefore, when the hon. Lady says that she will look at it again, I hope that she will look at it meaning to do something about it—at least to change the words which are at present in the Clause to other words, even though they are not our words, which define something which can properly be considered. If all she means is to take the debate off the Floor of this Committee and then come back with exactly the same words on Report, this would be a little dishonest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Gentleman is being a little excessive in what he is asking of me. I remember
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
many occasions in this Committee when he or his hon. Friends have given an undertaking to look at something again. Clearly, in looking at a matter one must look at it genuinely, but one cannot commit oneself to a total change in one's attitude or of one's mind. I think that I am being extremely generous. If the right hon. Gentleman cannot accept the undertaking I am giving, that we will genuinely look at it again and see if we find ourselves able to meet the point but with no commitment that we shall necessarily be able to accept his form of words or a form of words nearer to his own arguments this morning, then this in itself would be something far beyond what is normally expected in Committee. I am being generous, and the right hon. Gentleman should accept the fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My disagreement is not with "fitness to teach". I certainly readily accept my hon. Friend's assurance that she will take another look at the question of "standards of education". I am quite willing to withdraw anything I said. I did not indicate how I was going to vote in any case. I accept her assurance unequivocally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean to be ungracious, but merely wished to point out that the words which the hon. Lady used were not those normally used on these occasions—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: They were honest words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:—by my hon. Friends when they were on that side of the Committee offering to take something back and to have a look at it. She went much further than the usual phrase of, "Of course I cannot give a guarantee". She said, "I do not think we shall be able to do anything about it at all." However, if the hon. Lady is genuinely going to try to find a way round what is a small but important difficulty, then with pleasure I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman wish to move the following Amendment?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I imagine that the words the hon. Lady used cover the consequential Amendments. Therefore, I imagine that I do not have to move them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Amendment No. 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, in page 1, line 17, to leave out "entering the teaching profession" and to insert "for registration under this Act".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This Amendment also relates to a small point and is for clarification. I think I am right in saying, certainly from everything one has read in the Wheatley Report, that what the Government intend in this Clause—and this line—is regulations for those entering the teaching profession in the State schools. I do not think the hon. Lady wishes to say that the Teaching Council will lay down regulations which must be observed in Edinburgh Academy, or in private schools, or in other parts of the teaching profession. If I am right in this, my Amendment, which merely changes "entering the teaching profession" to "for registration under this Act", makes the position clear and will probably be acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is probably reasonable to regard this Amendment as to a considerable extent fitting in with the Amendment which we have just discussed. If one talks of "standards of education" it is reasonable to talk of "entering the teaching profession". If one talks of "educational qualifications", it is reasonable to limit the phrase a little more in terms of "for registration under this Act". If the right hon. Gentleman is agreeable, it would be convenient to me to look at this in conjunction with the Amendments which he has just moved.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate that as this is a starred Amendment the hon. Lady has not had time to look at it and study it, but in fact it is nothing whatever to do with the first two Amendments. It is merely a question of whether the Teaching Council should control every person who wants to become a teacher in Scotland, whether he or she is to teach in a private school, in Edinburgh Academy, or in some new type of teaching institution which may spring up; or whether the Teaching Council is dealing, as the Wheatley Committee intended it should, only with people entering the main stream of teaching in State schools. It has no relevance to the other Amendments at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Norman Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order. I think there is some importance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0133">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
in this Clause. I do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman, but as this is a starred Amendment, could it be left to a future meeting of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say that we have to take the Amendments in order, and so I cannot accede to the hon. Member's request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of clarification, let me say that the registration provisions will govern the position of teachers in any school, whether it be public, grant-aided or independent; they are not limited to education authority schools. This has some bearing on whether one uses the phrase "entering the teaching profession" or the more limiting phrase suggested by the right hon. Gentleman. It is important to see that this is fairly widely drafted, leaving the detailed prescription of the precise qualifications for registration to be dealt with under the regulations under Clause 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised this point when I was speaking, and thought that I had pointed out that there was a fundamental difference between this Clause 2 and Clause 7, in that this Clause controls entry in a passive way without any power to act other than recommend. Registration is a power which belongs to the Secretary of State. That, so far as I understand the Bill, does not enter into this Clause 2 with which we are now dealing. I agree with the suggestion of my hon. Friend that we might leave this for discussion with the Amendments which have already been relegated to my hon. Friend for further thought. In view of this fundamental distinction, it would be wise to have a little time to think over this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This raises a far more fundamental question than the right hon. Gentleman imagined when he was moving the Amendment. There is something in what he said; it is something which we have got to look at and consider. I am not sure whether we shall have any future opportunity to discuss this if we do not discuss it now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Clause now stands it suggests that it would be the duty of the Council to keep under review the standards for entry to the teaching profession. This would include everyone entering the teaching profession. But if the words
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
were changed to the words "for registration under this Act" it would not prevent from entering the teaching profession people who were not registered. The crucial point relates to the entry of people to the profession without registration—the employment of people as teachers who are not on the register. If the Committee leave the words as they are in the Clause, the recommendations of the Council cover everybody entering as a teacher and would not just deal with the question of registration. This ties up with some other points which will follow later. This is fundamental to the whole matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst I realise that this is a starred Amendment and that she has not had time to do the necessary homework on it, I hope my hon. Friend will tell us a little more about the intention of these words. Are the words "persons entering the teaching profession" put in in order that no person who is not on the register will be allowed to teach? Does it mean the exclusion of all non-registered people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps my hon. Friend would like me to answer that point straightaway. We have to be quite clear that in this subsection we are giving the Council powers to keep certain matters under review. The matters which we require to ask the Council to keep under review are deliberately broadly expressed so that we do not unduly limit the Council by restrictive phraseology. Therefore, the phrase "entering the teaching profession" is a broader phrase than the other one which is suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With due respect to my hon. Friend, the Clause does rather more than charge the Council with keeping certain matters under review. It also charges the Council to make recommendations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not this part.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed. The Clause says this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and to make to the Secretary of State from time to time such recommendations with respect to those standards as they think fit."</p></blockquote>
This is the beginning. This is where regulations begin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to see the powers of the Council here and the application of the regulations. If a regulation were made
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0134">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
by the Secretary of State upon a recommendation of the Council after it had conducted a review under the Clause, and if it applied to everyone entering the profession, I take it that this would apply equally to persons on the register and to persons not on the register. It would have the effect, if the recommendation were accepted of excluding all non-registered teachers from teaching. This is a possible interpretation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like to keep on intervening in my hon. Friend's speech, but it may help him if I point out that the regulations will not be made under subsection (2), which refers to Clause 7. It is under Clause 7 that the regulations will be made. I cannot stress too highly that what this subsection does is simply to give the general powers to review matters which it is thought the Council ought to have under its remit. It is nothing more than that in the most general terms. It is at a later stage, in Clause 7, that the power to make regulations comes up, which could deal with the matters about which my hon. Friend is talking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect again to my hon. Friend, this goes beyond review. It includes the power, the only power the Council has, to recommend. The second part of the subsection says
	<br><blockquote><p>"and to make to the Secretary of State from time to time such recommendations …"</p></blockquote>
It is upon those recommendations, which will be accepted or not accepted by the Secretary of State—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point my hon. Friend must get clear in his mind at this stage is this. Is he against the Council making recommendations. After all, recommendations can be either accepted or rejected. If they are rejected, my hon. Friend has no complaint. If they are accepted, the regulations will be made. They can be prayed against. We would then have an opportunity to debate the matter. Here the power is to keep under review. This is purely hypothetical: the house is merely being built; it has no substance, no bricks. Does my hon. Friend want completely to nullify any good the Council could do with a review?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has missed the point entirely. The Council is
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
to solve all education problems in Scotland, we must remember: all education problems are to be solved by the Council! Yet the only power it has is a power to recommend, which is given to it under this Clause. How far is it to be allowed to recommend? Will the recommendations, which might be accepted by the Secretary of State, affect everyone who enters teaching, or will they affect only those who apply for registration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all respect, I think my hon. Friend is misleading. The Clause speaks of standards required of persons entering the teaching profession. We are not dealing at this stage with the finished product. We are dealing with those proposing to enter the teaching profession. In this respect it would be wrong to delete the words it is proposed to delete. We are not dealing with the teacher. We are saying to people, "Before you can enter a college of education in Scotland you must have the standards and satisfy the requirements as laid down". My hon. Friend is blowing this matter up into something which is not contained in the Clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that speech. I do not think that he has got the point at all. I think he is misrepresenting me and missing the point of this very important Amendment. This is critical. If the Council, under the Clause makes a recommendation which has to apply only to the registration of teachers and not to entry into the profession, it may be a very dangerous thing to accept the Amendment. I want to hear what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has to say. I want to know the extent to which the recommendations will apply. Will non-registered teachers with none of these qualifications still be able to teach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robertson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the Clause, if the Amendment were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we should not let this go without very full discussion. I am apprehensive about it. I do not want us to set up a Council which is supposed to give teachers status if at the same time we leave a loophole so that all the unqualified people can enter the profession. I agree that they would not be registered, but there would be nothing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
to prevent a local authority from employing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A provision that the Council's powei is to regulate entry to the profession would give the Council the right to exclude non-registered people from teaching. I do not want this issue to be shirked. I want the issue to be discussed. This is why I feel so upset about the whole Bill. I think that people just have not been sufficiently open about its purposes. There are two conflicting issues. In terms of this Clause, teachers see it as meaning that the Council will make recommendations for entry to the profession. As I read other speeches, this is not the interpretation placed upon it by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, by the Scottish Office or even by the Wheatley Committee. They see it merely in relation to registration, with the Council laying down qualifications for registration but saying nothing about the employment of non-registered teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) is right. An important matter of policy arises. If the words "persons entering the teaching profession" are retained, it is at least arguable that the Bill means that the jurisdiction of the Council extends to all teachers. It would mean on that interpretation that no one could teach in Scotland as from the coming into force of the Bill who did not satisfy the requirements of the Council as translated into law by the Secretary of State by regulations.

I should have thought, reading the Bill as a whole, that this is not intended. Because it is doubtful whether this is intended, it is equally doubtful whether this is the interpretation which would be placed upon it. We must be careful. It is not a case of the scope of the powers. It is the jurisdiction of the Council. Is it the Government's policy to extend the jurisdiction of the Council, in so far as it can make recommendations, beyond the category of persons who are to be registered, or is it the Government's intention that the Council's jurisdiction is to be restricted to that category of persons who seek registration—that is, in respect of State schools.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to labour the point. There would be some difficulty about taking the broad interpretation of this,
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
in view of the rest of the Bill. One of the main functions of the Biff is clearly the establishment of a register and the substitution of the present arrangements for certification of teachers by a system of registration. The core of the Bill is registration. To satisfy the requirements for registration we are thrown back on to the regulations made by the Secretary of State, the recommendations made by the teaching body, and the review made by the body prior to making those recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is at least arguable that, despite the wide term "entering the teaching profession" in the context of the Bill, this applies only to persons seeking registration. If this is so, I should have thought that for the avoidance of doubt alone it would be advisable to accept the Amendment. In the last resort it seems to be a question of policy. I should be interested to know precisely what the Government's policy is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Sir M. Galpern</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot follow the line of reasoning advanced by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Wylie). He is jumping the gun. After all, we are at this stage considering Clause 2 only. Subsequently we may reach a stage when the type of school for which registration is essential and unavoidable will be established. We have not yet reached that stage. The burden of the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument is that a person will not be able to teach in any type of school, not even in a private school or kindergarten, unless he has received the hallmark of registration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask hon. Members to consider what the practical effect of the Amendment would be. If the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"for registration under this Act"</p></blockquote>
were inserted in place of
	<br><blockquote><p>"entering the teaching profession"</p></blockquote>
the practical effect would be that colleges of education would have two streams of students—those who had announced their intention of becoming registered and those who had announced that they had no intention of becoming ultimately registered teachers. This happens in the faculty of law. Not everyone who enters the faculty intends to practise as a solicitor. If the Amendment were accepted, we should open the door to there being two categories. One category would say,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0136">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
"We shall not ask for entry. Therefore, all the regulations, recommendations and qualifications do not apply to us". It passes my understanding why anyone should at this stage wish to delete the essential part requiring all these standards to be prescribed for those wishing to enter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The last thing I want to do is to take up the time of the Committee. Every Amendment I have moved I have moved as quickly and as simply as I could merely to ask for some clarification. The point of the Amendment was perfectly simple and I genuinely believed, as did my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Wylie), that the Teaching Council was limited to a consideration of the problems of State schools. We did not believe that it was the Government's intention that the same procedure, regulations and thoughts were to apply to schools like Gordonstoun and Edinburgh Academy or the universities, which are also part of the teaching profession. All I asked for and hoped that I would get was immediate clarification of the position which everybody who had read the Wheatley Report thought to be the position, and which was that this would apply only to State schools. I expected the answer "Yes", when I would have withdrawn my Amendment at once. I beg the hon. Gentleman to realise that it is not my fault that that was not the answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The biggest bird nuisance in the world is the cuckoo, which always wants to lay its eggs in someone else's nest. That is what the right hon. Gentle-
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
man has been doing. He has come into the middle of my speech to make a speech of his own. He has done it with the simple eloquence of the individual caught in the act. "I wasn't trying to kick the ball that way at all, but to kick it back on the field" is his attitude; innocence beaming all over his face while destruction is hidden in his mind. The right hon. Gentleman knows it. I shall not give way again to allow him to make another speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issue is as simple as it looks. Here is a provision which has one purpose and one purpose only. It is to give the Council, mostly teachers, the power to review all the things which we have been discussing. Do we want the Council to have this power? Nobody shakes his head now. This is the simple function of the Clause and the other matters which the right hon. Gentleman has sought to insert are matters already pertaining to the powers of the Secretary of State which will be discussed when we reach Clause 7.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of us who want to see these recommendations enforced and this power in the hands of the Council will want to see that every teacher teaching in Scotland is a registered teacher. To include any reference to registration in the Clause at this point when, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, we shall have ample time and opportunity to discuss the issue on Clause 7, is simply to hinder the progress of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can clarify the issue to some extent, although I cannot altogether allay every anxiety which has been expressed, because so many different and opposing anxieties have been expressed. Let me first clear up the extent to which registration by the Council will affect the employment of teachers in different types of school. For permanent employment in an education authority or grant-aided school, a teacher must be certificated and we expect that in future he will have to be registered. All this is a function of the Secretary of State under his power to prescribe standards for education authorities or on governing bodies under the 1962 Act. It is nothing to do with the Bill. These powers are already in existence and will still be in existence when the Bill is passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
At present, there are no similar requirements in relation to independent schools, for example, the Edinburgh Academy or others one can think of. In such schools it is open to the governing bodies to employ such persons as they think fit. The Secretary of State has no direct power to require them to be certificated now, or registered in future, but he may, if he chooses, revoke the registration of an independent school under the Registration of Independent Schools (Scotland) Regulations, 1957, if he is dissatisfied with the qualifications of a particular teacher, or thinks that the school is misusing its powers in this respect. The proprietors of the school would have the right of appeal to the Independent Schools Tribunal. I hope that makes that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That there are no powers in the Bill in terms of the employment of certificated or uncertificated, registered or unregistered teachers, but that these powers are already in the hands of the Secretary of State, deals with what my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley (Mr. John Robertson) was saying. We need not be concerned one way or another about this phrase "entering the teaching profession", because the Secretary of State already has these powers under other legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are anxious not to prescribe limits to the matters which the Council may consider it proper to look at and on which to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. We want the matters to be kept under review to be as wide as may be compatible with the Secretary of State's responsibility for education in Scotland. We believe that "entering the teaching profession" is a phrase slightly wider than that proposed in the Amendment. It gives the Council power to look at the general educational position in Scotland and to consider what needs to be done and to make any recommendation it chooses to the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (1) defines the whole purpose of the Bill and does so in terms which the Government regard as expressing their concept of the division of responsibility between the Secretary of State and the teachers as a profession. The Bill does not seek to give the teachers more than it is suitable that they should have the power to do in the light of my right hon. Friend's responsibility; nor does it do less. We believe it to be the right balance. "Entering the teaching profession" would give the Council power to keep under
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
review matters which are suitable to it. There is not much between us on the argument, but the balance lies with the words as they are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is right, it appears that the Council has a jurisdiction to make recommendations under subsection (1) which is wider than the Secretary of State's power to make regulations, having regard to those recommendations, under Clause 7(1), because Clause 7(1) specifically states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Secretary of State may make regulations prescribing the requirements as to education … to be fulfilled by a person in order to qualify him to be recommended by the governing body of a college of education to the Council for registration."</p></blockquote>
This is the hard core of the scope of the Secretary of State's powers. If the provisions of Clause 2(1) relate to recommendations over a wider respect, not confined to registration, then the Council will have power to make recommendations on matters about which the Secretary of State has no power to act, and I cannot regard that as satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty is that in the interpretation Clause there is no definition of "teaching profession". In any event, that might be a useful Amendment to be considered later, but as it stands it is at least open to argument that the Council can make recommendations having regard to standards of education required of persons entering the profession, and on the face of it that would apply to people who did not seek registration and who had no intention of teaching in State schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. and learned Gentleman is under some misapprehension. Clause 7(1) relates to regulations which would qualify somebody to be recommended to the Council for registration. Clause 2(1) asks the Council to keep under review various matters concerned with entry to the profession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And to make recommendations on these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am coming to that. I give a hypothetical example, hoping that the Committee will recognise that one of the dangers in doing so is that this might be regarded as an indication to the Council of what we hope and expect that it would do. The Council might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
recommend to the Secretary of State that there should be another college of education, another institution for training the particular kinds of teachers needed. That would be covered by Clause 7(1). It would be perfectly proper for the Council to make recommendations and for the Secretary of State to take action within his other powers simply to build a college of education or to have approaches made to a university to provide certain courses, or to consult his colleagues in the Cabinet about whether money might be made available for such purposes. All of these things could be covered by Clause 2(1) and would have nothing to do with Clause 7(1). These are all matters which are highly relevant to the standard of education and the training required by persons entering the teaching profession on which we would hope that, exercising its responsibilities in these matters, the Council would feel it appropriate to make representations to my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the hon. Lady tell me under what statutory powers the Secretary of State could effect recommendations of the Council covering non-registered teachers?

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not expressing it very well. If the purpose of the Bill is to regulate conditions of registration, but the Council is to have power to make recommendations on standards of training for everyone entering the profession, has the Secretary of State power to enforce recommendations about that category of teachers who are not registered and have no intention of being registered under the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman's question is somewhat tautological. He is asking whether the Secretary of State has power to make regulations for the training of people who are not going to be trained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not going to be registered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: But registration would imply the satisfying of certain standards of

training. Therefore, if a person proposes to be registered, the assumption is that he has satisfied standards of training.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was covered by a reply to an earlier question. Under the Registration of Independent Schools (Scotland) Regulations, 1957, the Secretary of State has power to limit the employment of uncertificated teachers now—that is, "unregistered" in future—in the independent schools if he chooses to use it. At the moment, there is no need to suppose that he would, but if he were dissatisfied, the powers would be available to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This raises a question covered in the Bill under Clause 8, with this exceptional circumstance under which teachers with qualifications acquired abroad might be registered by the Council. It is for the Council to decide. If one is talking about a teacher in an independent school, who is an English graduate, to be registered by the Council, there is nothing to prevent that teacher from being so registered if the Council decides that his training and qualifications make him suitable for registration.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, an education authority and a grant-aided school stand in the same position here in that teachers in them at present must be certificated, and in the future we expect that they will be registered for permanent employment. Under the 1962 Act the Secretary of State can limit the powers of an education authority in relation to temporary employment as against permanent employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have said enough to indicate that "entering the teaching profession" is a phrase which gives the Council power to review matters concerning training which might not result in recommendations which would eventually be followed by regulations to be made by the Secretary of State, but might result in recommendations concerning the Secretary of State's powers in other fields to establish the means of training, to increase the amount of training, to put up buildings, and to spend money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recommendations of that kind could be made if we left the subsection with the phrase "entering the teaching profession". To the extent that we limit it as for registration under the Bill, to that extent we reduce the capacity of the Council to consider these broader questions and to convey its thoughts and recommendations to the Secretary of State. On that basis, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw his Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again the hon. Lady speaks one way and wants me to do the opposite. It is clear that the Amendment has at least had the advantage of smoking out something which was comparatively unknown to members of the Committee beforehand.

The hon.

I am glad that now it does not apply to those who enter independent schools. The intention is that it should not.

I do not accept the hon. Lady's view about giving the Teaching Council the widest possible powers to discuss school buildings and whether the Secretary of State is doing his job in the Cabinet or

not. I do not believe that this is the function of the Council, but, as she believes that it would help her if I were to withdraw my Amendment, I shall do so.

I am obliged to you, Mr. Brewis, for calling these Amendments even though they are starred, and I should like to repeat my apology for having with such little warning foisted on the Committee, and on the hon. Lady, certain Amendments which seem to me to be of substance. As I explained, this was due to a mishap on the part of the Post Office. At the same time, however, perhaps I might point out that when we considered the Bill in principle I gave the hon. Lady notice of my intention to move Amendments along these lines.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At that time it seemed that the Bill was a useful one, and a step towards achieving self-government in the teaching profession. I said that it was only a step, and that I had some misgivings about it. Since then I have given a good deal of thought to this matter, and I feel much more strongly about it than I did before. It seems to me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
that the provisions in this Clause for conferring powers on the Council are not a useful step at all, but are merely a hollow sham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, the Clause as drafted is a whited sepulchre of all the hopes and aspirations of the teaching profession in Scotland to look after their own affairs with regard to entry into the profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have here a series of platitudes giving the Council powers to do things which are the prerogative of every citizen in the country, and that is to think about the various aspects of the education of teachers, and so on, and to make recommendations to the Secretary of State. Anyone can make these recommendations to the Secretary of State, and there is nothing in the Clause or in any other part of the Bill which obliges the Secretary of State to accept them. It seems to me that we are setting up a high-powered Council and giving it no power to do anything whatever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I seek to do, particularly by Amendment No. 8, is to put upon the Council fairly and squarely the initiative in making regulations for controlling the education and training of teachers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tam Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would I be right in thinking the hon. Member relates these Amendments to those to Clause 7?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not a bit. We are not discussing Clause 7. We are discussing Clause 2, and the Amendments which have been called relate only to this Clause. The hon. Gentleman ought to know that at this stage it would be out of order to discuss any Amendments to Clause 7. Even though those Amendments might require further Amendment at a later stage, I think I am right in confining my remarks to the Amendments now before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the previous debate I referred to other professions. The medical profession would be horrified if the Minister of Health, or any other outside authority, were to lay down regulations affecting the medical profession. The B.M.A. has complete authority to regulate the terms of entry to that profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to the solicitors' branch of the legal profession. The Council of the Law Society, both in England and Scotland, makes regulations for admission to the profession. They
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
are professional people who have knowledge of the needs of the profession. They have complete autonomy, subject only to this, that in the legal profession the Lord Chancellor of England and the Lord President of the Court of Session have a right of veto in the public interest. That is what I am proposing for the teaching profession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are going to a great deal of trouble to set up a high-powered body representing all facets of the teaching profession, but we are clipping its wings and giving it nothing except power to make recommendations which any person in this country can make. The effect of the Amendment is to put the initiative on the Teaching Council to frame the regulations and submit them to the Secretary of State. After all, they are the people who are really in touch with the teaching profession and its needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my view it is wrong for the Secretary of State to sit in an ivory tower in Whitehall and use dictatorial powers, which he may justify as being in the public interest, to disregard entirely the practical feelings and needs of the teaching profession. This is a learned profession to which we are seeking to give status, and there is no reason why we should not give it status similar to that given to the medical and legal professions. It is for that purpose that I move the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman can say that it is possible for the Secretary of State—to use the hon. Gentleman's words—to disregard entirely the views of the teaching profession. Even arguing in terms of the advantage of the affirmative resolution over the negative resolution, as outlined in Clause 7, it seems that there is some matter of substance about which to argue, but it seems a rash generalisation, and one without foundation, to say that the Secretary of State can disregard the views of the profession entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman need not apologise too profusely for the lateness of the Amendments on the Notice Paper, because during his Second Reading speech he gave me good warning that he had these thoughts in mind, and I was not totally unprepared for them to appear today.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0141">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
The Amendments are radical indeed, radical in a regressive rather than a progressive sense, in that they are designed to recast the functions of the Council. The hon. Gentleman explained that he had no doubt about the effect of the Amendments, or about his intentions. He wishes to change the relationship between the Council and the Secretary of State. He wishes to bring about a different sort of relationship from that which the Bill embodies at the moment. He wants to leave it to the Council, subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, to make regulations on qualifications for registration and for various other things which follow from his Amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the Bill could have been that sort of Bill. It could have been one which gave power to take action to make regulations subject only to the approval of the Secretary of State. As I say, it could have been that kind of Bill. It could have been the kind of Bill which gave teachers many of the powers which some other professions have in their own fields.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But that was not the basis recommended by the Wheatley Committee. If the Committee had felt that that was the kind of Council for which the Bill ought to provide, it would have said so, but it rejected the hon. Gentleman's concept of what the Bill ought to be. The Committee discussed at some length the arrangements which other professions have made throughout the years. It discussed the arrangements which now exist in medicine, in law, and so on, and assessed what it thought ought to be the functions and the limitations of a teachers' council. It did this in the light of its consideration of what had happened in the other professions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman knows, the requirements for entry into the medical profession are not entirely open to the medical profession itself to determine. They are subject to the approval of the Privy Council. In many cases of professions controlling their own standards of entry there is written in somewhere a power vested in some part of the governmental body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

What did the Wheatley Committee say about this? Perhaps I may quote from paragraph 47. It said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many members of the medical and other professions are self-employed and are bound only by a contract"—</p></blockquote>
this is highly relevant in this week—
	<br><blockquote><p>"to render certain services to those who choose from time to time to make use of their professional skills. In the teaching profession, however, virtually all teachers are employed persons, who have entered into a contract of service with their employers. Both because of the nature of this employment, which lays on the employers the onus of guaranteeing to the general public that they are qualified practitioners, and because of the vital importance of education to modern society, it is clear that there are interests other than the profession itself which are closely concerned with its standards. Thus the public, the employing authorities, and the Secretary of State and Parliament cannot be expected to divest themselves of their interest, and may reasonably claim the right to a say in what might be thought to be largely, if not solely, a matter for the teaching profession."</p></blockquote>
It was on that basis, having made a comparison with the other professions, that the Wheatley Committee recommended that the Council should have the functions given to it under the Bill. Those functions are clearly laid out in the Wheatley Report and are embodied in the Bill. Certainly the Wheatley Committee was clearly anxious to see the Council have as much scope as possible for taking initiatives, but it recognised that the public interest required that the Secretary of State should have effective powers of final control.

It is interesting to note that this morning we have had from hon. Members opposite two proposals which move in totally different directions. The first tried to circumscribe the Teaching Council, in spite of the allegation by hon. Members opposite that that is not what it would do. Its effect would have been to circumscribe and limit a little more the powers of review, the duties and responsibilities of the Council. Now they are going in a different direction. They want to take from the Secretary of State some of his powers. I submit that in the light of our discussion this morning the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble) and the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pent-lands (Mr. Wylie) are going in totally different directions.

I submit that what we have in the Bill and what we had in the Wheatley

	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
Committee proposals are a realistic assessment of how the responsibilities should be shared, where the duties and powers should lie, and how much residual power should lie with the Secretary of State, since he has responsibility for education in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the Wheatley Committee which recommended that the Council should put its proposals for the various requirements for registration in the form of recommendations to which the Secretary of State could give effect by regulations, unless he thought it inexpedient to do so. The rest of Clause 7 follows, laying down the means by which, if the Secretary of State thinks it inexpedient, he conveys his reasons and his intentions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that the Amendment is the heart of the matter, and that it is the most important Amendment with which we have to deal. I agree that teachers have a right to as much self-government as possible. But when my hon. Friend says that the Council has complete power within the profession, does she not agree that the Council is broadly based, and has a minority of practising teachers, so that the Amendment is more moderate than it appears? In fact, it is not seeking complete control by the profession, because it is a balanced Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Wheatley Committee pointed out, that is often the case with councils for other professions. They are not always entirely composed of people from the professions themselves. Sometimes they include people from outside bodies. My hon. Friend is raising the question whether one identifies the relative responsibilities of the Secretary of State on the one hand and the Council on the other in terms of the functions provided in the Bill or in terms only of the membership of the Council. It seemed to the Wheatley Committee that it was not enough simply to try to distribute the powers and responsibilities in terms of the membership of the Council, but that they should be distributed also in terms of responsibilities, powers and duties both of the Council and the Secretary of State. That is what the Bill does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is what the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West would seek to
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
modify, and we feel that we must strongly resist the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dalyell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of the record, will my hon. Friend confirm that the reference by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) to the Council as being a sham is completely off beam?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I was so unaccustomed to hearing such a term from the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) that I did not fully appreciate that he had used it. I confirm what my hon. Friend says; indeed, my view was confirmed in what I said earlier, when I resisted the Amendments in the name of the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary has suggested that the Bill follows the recommendations of the Wheatley Committee. Will she confirm that the major recommendation of the Wheatley Committee on the relative powers of the Council and of the Secretary of State respectively—as contained in paragraph 103 of the Wheatley Report—is that the Secretary of State should not be able on his own initiative to put forward proposals, and that that recommendation has been removed in the Bill? There is a great deal of confusion as to what powers the Bill provides. Some hon. Members, and perhaps some bodies in the teaching profession, have sought to persuade themselves that the powers contained in the Bill are greater than they really are. The Wheatley Committee did not recommend the provision of very great powers. The principal power was the suggestion, contained in paragraph 103, that the Council alone should have power to initiate recommendations of this sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important to correct the hon. Member on one point. Paragraph 103 spent much time in talking about the way in which initiatives should be taken by the Council, but the hon. Member apparently has not read the last sentence, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such an arrangement, however, should not debar the Secretary of State from drawing problems to the attention of the Council and inviting it to consider and recommend on necessary courses of action."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it says that the Secretary of State should have power to bring
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
matters to the attention of the Council. We appreciate that. But it is another thing to say, as the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum says, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Secretary of State is empowered to make regulations for the education and training of teachers, either on the basis of recommendations from the Council or on his own initiative."</p></blockquote>
That suggestion is quite apart from any recommendation contained in paragraph 103. There is a great difference between saying, on the one hand, that the Secretary of State should have power to bring matters to the attention of the Council and, on the other, that he should have a complete right to initiate regulations and new proposals of any sort without their first having come from the Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my opinion the Bill is right and the Wheatley Committee is wrong. I think that it would be unwise to remove the right of the Secretary of State to initiate regulations, and to that extent I support the Bill, but it is wrong to try to pretend that the Bill's provisions are the same as were recommended by the Wheatley Committee, because on this major proposal they are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Clark Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a certain amount of sympathy with what my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has been trying to do, but I do not think that the time for it has yet come, and I cannot go all the way with him. The medical profession is more or less independent, but the Privy Council has certain rights over it. In the legal profession the Bar Council is the supreme body, and it does not contain any outside people. This profession works extremely well. I hope that one day the teaching profession will be developed on the same lines.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In answering the arguments the hon. Lady has overlooked the last of the Amendments, which provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such regulations shall have no effect unless and until they have been approved by the Secretary of State."</p></blockquote>
He must have an overriding responsibility, in the public interest. I appeal to the hon. Lady, however, to put the profession on a par with the medical profession and the solicitors' branch of the legal profession, where the Lord Chancellor in England and the Lord President in Scotland have the right of
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
veto. She herself says that in the medical profession the right of veto is vested in the Privy Council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked her to equate the teaching profession with the other professions, which is right and proper, no matter who the employers are. After all, the principal employer of the medical profession is Her Majesty's Government. It may be that the Amendments are badly worded, or that they go a little too far at present, but I plead with the hon. Lady to give thought to this question to see whether she can go a step further at a later stage and give the teaching profession a further lift towards achieving the status to which it is entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 6, in page 1, line 19, to leave out "think fit" and to insert "deem advisable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that we could also discuss Amendment No. 15, in Clause 3, page 2, line 9, leave out "think fit" and insert "deem advisable" which deals with the same point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it be convenient to the Committee to take Amendment No. 15 at the same time? So be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wylie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very small point, and I shall not lose any sleep if the hon. Lady cannot accept the Amendment. The words "as they think fit" are really appropriate to the exercise of executive power. One finds those words repeatedly in modern legislation such as the planning Acts, and we had them again and again in our last Bill, but the Council does not have executive powers; it is a purely advisory body. It is there to make recommendations, but it does not have power to take executive decisions. It would therefore appear that the words "deem advisable" would be more appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Hart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall have time only to begin to argue against this very tactfully moved Amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. and learned Member says, it is not very substantial. The words to which he objects are the usual and accepted words when it is intended to reflect the discretionary powers of a responsible body. Here we are in some
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V004P0I0144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
difficulty in getting over to the Committee a real understanding of the nature of this body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly not an executive body, but it cannot appropriately be described as an advisory body. We appear to be falling into the trap of trying to use words when no precise words exist to describe the functions and duties of this Council. It is something between an advisory and
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
an executive body. If we used the word "advisory" we should be limiting it to its advisory capacity, whereas if we used the words "think fit" we should be more clearly expressing an in-between view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
