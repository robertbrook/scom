	<div class='legislation'>Draft Castle Vale Housing Action Trust (Area and Constitution) Order 1993</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Tony Baldry)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Castle Vale Housing Action Trust (Area and Constitution) Order 1993.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the agreement of the Committee, it will be convenient to discuss at the same time the other order before us, namely, the draft Tower Hamlets Housing Action Trust (Area and Constitution) Order 1993.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be for the convenience of the Committee if I briefly introduced the two instruments. Designation orders for other housing action trusts have recently been made and the principles of housing action trusts have been well set out. I shall be happy to respond to any questions that members of the Committee would like to ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is considering the designation of two further housing action trusts at Castle Vale and in Tower Hamlets. Both designation maps are straightforward, unlike the one that we considered in relation to the Liverpool housing action trust, which included most of the tower blocks in Liverpool. The Castle Vale housing action trust covers the area immediately surrounding the Castle Vale estate, with the exception of one privately owned warehouse. Apart from that, the whole of the Castle Vale estate, which was built on a runway during the 1960s, is part of the housing action trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbett 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some good news for the Minister. The former hangars, which he described as a warehouse, have been razed to the ground and the headquarters of Betterware now sit on that site. Those headquarters will be occupied from next January and will offer the prospect of local jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is excellent news. The site is clearly shown on the map as being outside the designated area, to which I referred, and it will not form part of the housing action trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I am sure members of the Committee have seen, the trust area in Tower Hamlets includes several tower blocks. The three estates in Bow—Lefevre Walk, Monteith and Tredegar Road—contain 1,600 dwellings in a combination of high and medium-rise blocks. There are no houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, we are agreeing the designation of the two areas, which will, in due course, be transferred from the local authority to the housing action trust once the homing action trust boards have made their proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have asked me to give assurances that sufficient funding will be available to the housing action trusts throughout their lifetime. I shall certainly give that assurance. Housing action trusts have been extremely
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
successful. They produce corporate plans annually, covering the forthcoming three years, and the finance limits for housing action trusts are set on the basis of those plans. An external finance limit is set for the first year and indicative finance limits are set for the subsequent two years, and then confirmed. The funding for housing action trusts is not top-sliced. It comes from a separate vote and there is no question of a housing action trust not receiving grant aid for any year. We also appreciate that the profile for funding housing action trusts will not necessarily be the same during the trust's lifetime. In the early years, not so much might be spent; then there will be a peak in spending that will tail off towards the end of the trust's life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another cause for concern is what happens at the end of the trust's life—when it has completed its work and the estates have been refurbished and rejuvenated. As members of the Committee will know, at that stage, tenants on an estate will have a choice about whether to return to the local authority or to have an alternative landlord, such as a housing association. Many may have bought their homes under the right-to-buy scheme or the rent-to-mortgage scheme in the interim. A range of options are available to tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
HAT have commanded substantial support from local residents, so I hope that the Committee can make speedy progress today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tenants in Castle Vale and Tower Hamlets voted for their HAT to be established by clear majorities of 92 per cent. and 65 per cent. respectively. From my visits to Castle Vale, I know that, now that the HAT has been set up and the tenants have chosen their board the tenants are keen to get on with the job. They are enthusiastic about the opportunity that has been provided by the Government through HAT. The order, which makes the designation, is a further step on that route. I hope that the Committee will agree to it speedily, so the work can be got on with and be done with as quickly as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.37 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Battle 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Leeds, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Committee's principle objective were merely to tackle the problem of the need for substantial repairs and investment in local authority housing in these two areas, I should hope that there would be no division in the Committee. However, before the Minister starts to wax too lyrical, in the past tense, about how extremely successful HAT have been, I remind him that the designation for Hull and Liverpool was only established on 2 February. The only other HAT is in Waltham Forest. I suggest to the Minister that, at this stage, it is a little premature to say how successful HAT have been.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
HAT are proving to be a Hobson's choice for tenants. I am sure that my hon. Friends and the Minister's civil servants can spell out in detail the reasons why, if the Minister needs an explanation. Local authorities have had their housing investment programmes cut every single year, by 50 per cent. at a time, since 1979. They have not been given the resources to do the job themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall go through the figures soon, but I want to pick up the Minister on something that he said. He said that the money is guaranteed for HAT because it is "top-sliced". That means that a bit is chopped off everybody's—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I made it clear that the money is not top-sliced. There is a separate vote for HATs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0400">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that, then, a separate vote within the overall kitty for the whole of housing in Britain, which is separate from every housing investment programme? Or is the money clawed back from the housing investment programme?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be clear so that there is no doubt about it. The funding for HATs is not top-sliced. It comes from a separate vote. Public spending provision for HATs for this year is £87 million; for next year, £88 million; and for the year after that, £90 million. It is clearly set out in the public spending survey. The programme is not top-sliced. The vote is entirely separate. That is why there is no question of HATs not receiving the resources that they require.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that clarification. I shall return to those figures in a moment. It amazes me that HATs are not top-sliced because practically all other housing programmes are. In the competitive city challenge scheme, local authorities propose schemes and are told that they did very well, and that their proposals looked good, but because so many entered the competition, people were unable to get the improvements that they wanted. In other words, housing money is top-sliced. That has undermined proper programmes and investment for the renewal and improvement of local authority housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more positive note, the Government were forced in the other place some time ago to concede that the option for housing action trusts ought to be tenant-led—the tenants ought to have a say. When the Government proposed the idea several years ago, many people will recall that there was great resistance to housing action trusts because tenants were not happy, to say the least, to believe that the management of their homes could simply be shunted into a separate body which, at the end of the process, might pass them on to an independent body without tenants being consulted. The Government were forced to accept that tenants should have a ballot and Labour Members campaigned very hard for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understood it, Tower Hamlets has been allocated, according to press reports, between £70 million and £85 million to be spent over five to seven years. Will the Minister clarify those figures? How will the programme look? There is a big gap between £70 million and £85 million. In Birmingham, press reports have suggested that £130 million will be spent. But again, we are not told whether that will be over five or seven years. In analysing those figures in terms of the number of properties involved, we need to know the detail of what improvements tenants will receive. Will tenants obtain improvements for the whole house or only for basic refurbishment? I should be grateful if the Minister would spell out the budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What impact will the amendments have on the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill, which went through the House last night? I also have questions about representation. What will be the structure and the level of representation on the board? We know that the boards in Liverpool, Hull and Waltham Forest have differing degrees of tenant and local authority representation. Will council representations be 20 per cent.? Will tenant representation be 40 per cent.?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Spearing 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newham, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the major criticisms, especially in east London, of such organisations is that they are feared
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
to be a possible replacement for council or municipal provision? The Conservative party boasts that this measure is assisting housing. It will put the appointees of the board, whom the Minister mentioned, wholly into the hands of, theoretically, the Secretary of State. But in fact other persons, whom we cannot mention, will advise the Secretary of State. The Conservative party is centralising government in a way which is the very opposite of its boasted intention—to say nothing of the 20 pages of legislation which set up the housing trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend. His point is especially relevant to the Tower Hamlet proposals. We need to know the precise details of what will happen if and when, hopefully, the properties return to local authorities. We do not know what mechanism will enable tenants to get back into local authority housing once they have been moved out. In Tower Hamlets, all the tenants involved might be new tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like assurances on the record that tenants in the housing action trust will still have secure tenancies and that they will not lose their rights to repair and to be consulted. Tenants also have the right to a clear timetable so that they know when the work will be done and what work will be done. Tenants need a clear view of the decanting arrangements—when they will be moved out and where they will be moved to—which need to be tied in with the budget as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise particular issues related to the Tower Hamlets HAT. Technically, the designated estates and the tower blocks remain under local authority administration and part of its responsibility. The HAT has not yet been set up. As I understand it—the Minister might be able to confirm this—Tower Hamlets is keeping the blocks empty and allowing no one else to move into them so that, in effect, there are fewer tenants there than is usual in the programming for a housing action trust area. In other words, it seems that empty blocks will be done up, despite the fact that there has been a ballot—notably, a lower ballot in Tower Hamlets than elsewhere in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want assurances that the proposals for the HAT in Tower Hamlets are not simply resulting in people not being allocated houses there because houses are effectively being declared derelict. More importantly, that is putting pressure on Tower Hamlets in terms of homelessness, because there is no alternative provision and the problem is astronomical. There are 3,500 homeless families on the local authority waiting list and that is generating an intense problem of stress and homelessness in neighbourhoods. I want the Minister to tell me whether the Tower Hamlets HAT will operate just for empty properties. How many tenants will be there? Will other tenants be decanted? That is important for what happens in the end.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During discussion on the Housing and Urban Development Bill, which is now the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill, we pressed for assurances that tenants who voted to go into a housing action trust area because they felt that they could not get the resources to improve their properties in any other way ought to have the right, not to go to any landlord decided by the Government, but to return to the local authority. The Minister said that that would be done. Despite that assurance, which we welcome, I am still not clear what will happen. Will there be public meetings and a new ballot? Who will vote in the new ballot, especially in Tower Hamlets? If all the people there are new tenants, that makes
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
a difference. Given that the purpose and the policy of the HAT is to "diversify tenure", to quote the Government, it seems that the Government are trying to squeeze properties currently under local authority control—through the HAT board and out of the local authority sector with, effectively, no practical right of return.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What will the Government consider proper arrangements under which local authorities could have the resources to take these properties back and to maintain them? There is also a larger connected issue: rents. What will happen to rents in the housing action trust programme? It is generally suggested that they will be frozen for the duration of the housing action trust programme. Will rents increase as each block in Tower Hamlets is improved or will tenants face a massive rent increase in one blow at the end of the programme?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to ask about local employment. When we discussed the Liverpool housing action trust, the Minister made great play of the fact that the programme was about social, economic and environmental improvement for people—that included providing local employment and training opportunities. Was that a theme that was suggested for Liverpool but not for the other HATs? It was not a feature of the Hull and Waltham Forest HATs. If the Government are trying to suggest to tenants that they might be involved and that local labour will be employed, I would be encouraged, but I have yet to see a mechanism by which the Government propose actually to do that. When some of us have argued for it in the past, the Government have thrown back at us the argument that they do not agree with contract compliance and that we must leave matters to the market. I am interested to know whether the Government are moving towards contract compliance for the HAT proposals. There are as yet no suggestions that that will happen in either Castle Vale or Tower Hamlets. I hope that the Minister will suggest what the Government's policy is and what their intentions are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, we shall look hard not only at tenants' participation and involvement but at the arithmetic. By that I mean the budget for the HATs, which we shall compare with what would have been the budget had local authorities been given a proper housing investment programme and been able to tackle the work themselves. In recent years many local authorities have developed dynamic, imaginative and participatory models to involve tenants in the management of their estates. I hope that the Government are not suggesting that all the eggs must be crammed into the HAT basket, as for many tenants, there are no other options because the Government have cut off the resources. That is why HATs are proving to be a Hobson's choice—they are all that is on offer and, at the moment, they seem to tenants to be the only way in which they can get repairs done in their lifetime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will understand that HATs are not the answer. I hope that they reconsider their approach and their attitude to local authority housing, and that, rather than marginalising residualised local authority housing by cutting back on housing investment programmes, they will realise that we need to get away from the phrase used by the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Thames (Mr. Lamont)—short-term thinking. We need proper, programmed renewal and repair, but that would mean a major shake-up in the way in which the Government budget for housing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.51 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Robin Corbet 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Erdington)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) is perfectly right to put the orders in the context of the Government's housing policy. My hon. Friends and I—and, I hope, Conservative Members—know from the experience of advice bureaux that the preponderance of housing cases during the past decade has risen dramatically. They account for approximately 90 per cent. of my constituency case load, and the problem represents the most enormous misery for growing numbers of people—young families trapped in one-bed flats at the top of tower blocks and families expected to bring up small children on the top deck of maisonette blocks with four flights of concrete steps and related problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the virtues of the HAT programme, the Minister and his colleagues should acknowledge that we have a major housing crisis which, sooner or later, must be dealt with. I am not arguing for a moment that all, or even the main, responsibility for solving the crisis should rest with local authorities—I believe that there should be a mix of provision. But the problem must be solved because it contains social dynamite: denying people what I consider to be one of the basic rights of life—the right to a roof over a person's or a family's head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of the Vale gave a thundering welcome to the housing action trust. In a ballot in which 74 of every 100 people used their vote—about the turnout for a general election—92 of every 100 said yes and eight in every 100 said no. That means that about 3,400 people voted yes, with 290 against. That vote was about more than the prospect of getting a better place to live, although that is important in an island state where 55 per cent. of tenants live in tower blocks, 10 per cent. live in low-rise blocks and 7 per cent. live in maisonettes. Many of those residents are expected to live like vertical battery hens in sky blocks, where the lifts are unreliable and foul, where damp causes ill health because of the way in which the blocks were thrown up and where a few people find it easier to behave as bad neighbours than as good neighbours. Of course they want and deserve better housing. But that is only the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hallmarks of the Vale are its poverty, poor housing, poor environmental conditions and the joblessness of 40 of every 100 people of working age. At local primary schools, 36 of every 100 children come from families so poor that they qualify for free school meals. At secondary schools, 29 per cent. qualify. Almost seven in 10 tenants have incomes so low that they qualify for housing benefit. I hope that the Minister does not expect people of the Vale to feel any gratitude to the Government, which have helped to put and keep them in that condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housing action trust is the tenants' decision; their demand and determination to work together to build a better life with better housing, better transport, better facilities, a better environment and, hopefully, training to give them a better chance of taking up local jobs when developments in the neighbouring Birmingham Heartlands urban development corporation get going. I hope that the Minister will tell us—my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West referred to this—that the Birmingham TEC and the Government's training and other agencies will get alongside the HAT, Birmingham Heartlands and local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
employers to ensure that training is available so that people of the Vale can obtain the training they need in order to secure local jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to pay tribute to Derek Waddington, the city of Birmingham's director of housing, and to his team, to councillor Stan Austin, who chairs the city council housing committee, to John Northover and local Department of the Environment officials, who have all worked so hard to persuade the Government and enable the HAT to be offered. Several of us had anxious moments in the days before the Budget when it seemed that public spending cuts might at least delay, if not extinguish, the go-ahead for the HAT. I want to pay special tribute to Mrs. Carol Rafferty, the determined person who chairs the community action team, which helped to organise the tenants and residents in the run-up to the HAT ballot. It is all too easy to expect there to be little local input in run-down areas, such as the Vale, where understandable apathy and acceptance is the rule rather than the exception; not so on the Vale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like all other communities, the people of the Vale have among them those with great, unused and mainly unknown strengths just waiting to be tapped. That is not to say that there have not been rows, arguments, walk-outs and fall-outs as people try to work together—and there will be more, although hopefully fewer, as people learn more about the skills of working together for a shared and common purpose. I congratulate Mrs. Rafferty, Mrs. Joan Lawrie, Mrs. Joyce Curtis and Mr. John Newton on their election as the four resident representatives of the HAT board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should tell my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West, who raised the important matter of resident representation, that the original offer was that residents should have two representatives. They were determined to have five and have ended up with four because better sense prevailed both in Whitehall and town hall. The CAT determined the method of their election, although I might say, now that it is all over, that I would have preferred a postal ballot, as was used when tenants were asked earlier this year whether they wished a HAT to be established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it perverse that the Department would not assist in enabling the 3,500 residents of owner-occupied houses and flats on the estate also to have a say in a separate, parallel ballot. That gave the impression, which I know was not meant, that those residents were nothing to do with the HAT. That is, of course, true in terms of transfer of ownership from the city council to the HAT, but the experience, skills and help of owner-occupiers is needed just as much in the development of the new Vale as those of tenants, as I have tried to make clear to them. Building the new Vale is a job for everyone who lives there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to funding HATs. I understand, and perhaps the Minister will confirm, that £130 million has been mentioned as the likely spend during the five to 10 years of the Castle Vale HAT's life. Does that allocated sum have to be spent in equal amounts over the years of the redevelopment? I heard what the Minister said about the need to understand that, in such matters, it is not possible to achieve level spends. The Minister will recall that on 11 June, in his reply to a question about city challenge funding, he made it clear that spending was subject to the annuality rules. I assume that the same will apply to HATs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
The Minister went on to say that underspends in one city challenge area are offset by speeding up programmes in other city challenge areas. Would that also apply to HATs? If so, will the Minister reconsider that matter? On 11 June he told me:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are considering whether further flexibility is possible."—[
	<i>Official Report,</i> 11 June 1993; Vol. 226, c. 
	<i>356.</i>]</p></blockquote>
The Minister knows—as we all do—that developments over these long periods do not lend themselves to equal annual spending amounts. Often there is a budgeted underspend in the first two years, an overspend in the next two or three years and an underspend against the annual flat allocation in the remaining years. That is known to have happened in the case of city challenge. The Minister has acknowledged that that is known to have happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why cannot this fact be recognised so that city challenge winners such as HATs are not penalised when they cannot sensibly spend an allocation in a particular year? As with local government spending, such a penalty can lead to less than vital spending towards the end of the financial year, simply to stop the money returning to the Treasury as an alleged underspend would probably affect the following year's allocation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will comment on those matters, or that he will write to members of the Committee about them later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made it clear that I welcome the Castle Vale HAT order. I have pledged my total support to the people of the Vale to help them to make the proposal a reality and to turn theirs into an area in which they would be proud to live, work and prosper. However, the Government, hon. Members, the city council, and members of the housing action trust need to understand one truth: the residents of the Vale are now in charge. Then-voices and views should and must decide what happens and when. The residents—the families and children—together will make a success of the new start that the HAT for the Vale will mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be churlish not to welcome the money that is being spent in Castle Vale in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Corbett). I congratulate him, the officers of Birmingham city council and his constituents—the residents—who have worked for many years to make the scheme a reality. In his reply, I ask the Minister to reflect on the effect that such projects have on the rest of the people in cities such as Birmingham.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent constituency neighbouring that of my hon. Friend. My constituency has not been fortunate enough to win a grand prize. Such as a housing action trust or a city challenge scheme. The inner city of Birmingham has a city challenge scheme. It is all right for the Minister to say that money for HATs is not top-sliced. Money for HATs is, however, awarded within the context of diminishing resources for public housing throughout Birmingham, Tower Hamlets and the nation. The only way to obtain money to repair housing is to go for one of those high-profile projects.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it an excellent idea to channel resources into an area to make a good job of problems that exist there. What better way to turn around an area than to direct resources into employment prospects, training prospects and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
housing? I welcome what is being done, both in New Town under city challenge and in Castle Vale under the housing action trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, for the rest of Birmingham's citizens, there are no resources left for the city council to spend on then-houses. Constituencies such as mine have pockets of real deprivation, need and suffering that never quite add up to enough to enable us to go for one of the big projects. Areas such as Castle Vale always draw those resources because deprivation is on a large scale and covers a large area. I am concerned that HATs will draw money from other pockets of resources within the city council—I am sure that that will happen in Castle Vale. The money will come from the Government for HATs and there will be an understandable tendency for the city council to concentrate other resources, such as those for education, to make a good job for Castle Vale.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Wyre)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow what the hon. Lady is saying. Is she saying that, because of HATs, her local authority will have no money for other projects? She appeared to say that in her earlier comments, but later she said that the money which would normally be available for those projects will be drawn towards HATs. Surely the opposite is true?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms. Morris</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was thinking of money that would be available from other departments, such as social services, which has urban renewal money to adapt private owner-occupier houses for the disabled. When I saw the director of housing last year to ask about money that would be available in my constituency for housing, I was told that beyond day-to-day repairs, all the money was going into the prestige projects in Castle Vale and in New Town. That is the reality for constituencies like mine that have real need but do not have the glamour of a HAT title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has to bear in mind that the Government's decision to direct resources to specific areas of need—I would not dispute the need in Castle Vale—within the context of diminishing public resources for public sector housing means that other areas of our great cities will be left resourceless in future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regrettable but understandable effect on residents is that as people suffer more and more, my constituents will turn to those in Castle and Vale and ask, "Why them and not me?" I find it difficult to explain to families in my constituency who live in tower blocks that need renovating, and to those who still have toilets outside the house, why millions of pounds of earmarked resources will be spent in Castle Vale and not in their constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I stress that the answer is not that Castle Vale should not get its money and that my constituents should get some instead. Hand in hand with the attempt to rejuvenate Castle Vale, which I welcome, the Government should ensure that sufficient public resources are given to Birmingham city council to cope with the growing needs of my constituents, who also need adequate housing, better jobs and more social services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Lynne Jones 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Birmingham, Selly Oak)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse the remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Ms. Morris). It was in Castle Vale that a two-tonne piece of concrete fell off the side of one of
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
its many tower blocks. That, together with similar incidents across the country, was a sure sign of structural problems in many of the non-traditional housing stock built in the 1950s and 1960s. When those problems were being uncovered, the Government saw fit dramatically and yearly to reduce the money that was available to local authorities. I am talking not about Government money, but about the ability of local authorities to raise their own finance, which is repaid through rental income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that the residents of Castle Vale, once they had the support of the local authority and had received reassurances that they could opt back into the local authority if they so wished, overwhelmingly endorsed the HAT. Residents wanted the money that should have been spent over the past decade to be used to deal with the structural problems and the modernisation that is needed on the estate and across the city. We should not, perhaps, have reached this state, had the £500 million which would have been available to Birmingham city council if spending been maintained been deployed as the council thought fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister knows that, for the past two years, Birmingham city council suggested a restricted and realistic programme based on the fact that it is not possible suddenly to gear up to spend dramatically more. Nevertheless, even given the restricted programme suggested by Birmingham city council, only about one third of the capital allocation was made available. Letters from the Department of the Environment quite rightly stated that Birmingham, as a local authority, was well ahead of the field in innovation and in its housing policies. If so, it worries me that local authorities such as that in Birmingham, which is a well managed authority—it has a low void rate and a good record on arrears—are forced to deploy resources in bidding for prestige projects such as housing action trusts, city challenge, estate action or safer cities projects. The Government introduce such projects to try to give the impression that they are actively dealing with the real problems of housing and inner cities. Why not allow a council such as Birmingham's to get on and do the job?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the chief executive to perform an exercise—I do not have the figures with me as I did not realise what format the Committee would take—which showed that tens of thousands of pounds' worth of officers' time has been taken up in bidding for prestige programmes, which are often in conflict with one another and which are often suddenly stopped. For example, the safer cities programme operated in my constituency, an out-of-city area with problems similar to those of Castle Vale. That project was successful. In a recent Question Time in the House, the Minister proclaimed that burglaries had been reduced by 90 per cent. He got the area wrong. That success was achieved not in the constituency of my right hon. Friend for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) but in mine. Despite the 90 per cent. reduction, the project suddenly stopped when the work had been carried out on only half the estate. Much time is spent on trying to gear up to such programmes but, suddenly, the Government pull the rug from under our feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good that Castle Vale will receive extra resources, but Birmingham has more than 400 tower blocks. I have a few in my constituency and I am trying to find out when the work that will probably be needed will start. When I last received a reply, the full survey had not been completed. It was claimed that there was no point in doing the full survey because by the time that work began matters might have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0404">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
changed dramatically. So Bimingham city council is concentrating on palliative repairs and regular checks to ensure that occupied buildings are kept safe. We still have no idea when work on hundreds of tower blocks in cities such as Birmingham can be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other housing worry is that, in recent years, projects on estates have generally led to faulty systems built or to inadequately designed properties being demolished. I guess that in Castle Vale there will be a loss of stock available for rent. When I first became a councillor on Birmingham city council, the housing stock numbered about 150,000; it is now 100,000—a dramatic decline. Many of the best houses have been sold and many properties on estates such as Castle Vale have had to be demolished. It is important that we consider replacing some of that rented stock. I know that the housing associations are doing a good job but their resources are completely inadequate for the task in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Erdington mentioned families who live in tower blocks. Their situation is growing worse. Because of the stock loss, Birmingham City Council has had to put families with very young children back into high-rise blocks. For the past 10 years, the council has had a policy of not allocating high-rise flats to families with children. That policy has now changed. Last year, about 500 homeless families with children—most of them aged under five years—were offered flats in high-rise blocks, which are totally unsuitable. As a result, single people have no chance of obtaining rented accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister assure the Committee that the level of resources that has been considered appropriate to put into Castle Vale will be made available to local authorities in other areas that are just as much in need of such investment? It is nonsensical that local authorities are having their capital programmes limited by bizarre Treasury rules that count spending that can be adequately financed from rent pooling and rental income against the public sector borrowing requirement; whereas a private company would not be treated the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Minister to use his influence on his Treasury colleagues to secure more resources for housing in general. In the long term, that would be beneficial to the public sector borrowing requirement and to employment. The high level of unemployment is another factor in estates such as Castle Vale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister at least assure the Committee that he is trying hard to put some common sense into the Treasury?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
As to the specific issue of HATs, as the hon. Member for Erdington said, they have been given a thundering welcome by the tenents concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding tenants' rights under HAT, the hon. Member for Leeds, West knows only to well—we have covered this subject before—that their rights are clearly set out in the Housing Act 1985 and in the tenants charter. The rights to security of tenure and the right to buy will continue under a HAT scheme. As to rent, in a joint statement the HATs made it clear that rents would be frozen until any improvements to tenants' homes had been carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition know well what happens at the end of the HAT. From previous debates, they know that the tenants involved will have a range of options—the right to return to the council, the right to buy, low-cost home ownership, transfer to a local housing association or setting up a tenant co-operative.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How will that be done? Will it be done by public meeting and by ballot, in the same way as the original HAT was set up?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baldry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman served on the Committee that dealt with the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill and he will know that under that Bill's provisions, the tenant in a single house will have a choice. That is straightforward. In the case of multi-dwelling buildings, a ballot of tenants will be carried out to establish their preferred future landlord. That ballot will be carried out on a block-by-block basis. The freehold of the bocks would be transferred in line with the preferences of the majority in each. With due respect, we covered that aspect recently when we considered the Liverpool housing action trust. Tenants will have the fullest opportunity possible to determine their future landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no fixed statutory lifespan for a HAT. By definition, HATs deal with especially difficult housing stock. We want to ensure that the task is done well and, as I have made clear, the money is available to do that. The £130 million is an illustrative figure that was proposed by Birmingham city council for all works on the estate, including the city's investment in non-housing activity. We estimate from a feasibility study that £74 million will probably be required to carry out housing refurbishment. Likewise, in Tower Hamlets, the figures of £71 million to £83 million refer to a range of options. Of course, it will be for the HAT board to tell us which option it prefers after full consultation with the tenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The indicative figures and the figures that I gave for the HAT public spending vote show that substantial sums of money will be invested in HATs. We are determined to ensure that HAT boards make provision each year to enable that money to be spent properly during the lifetime of the trust. The hon. Member for Erdington raised a question about annuality. We have already made it clear that no one expects a HAT to spend exactly the same amount of money each year during its lifetime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, tenant participation in HATs is essential. Much of the policy behind HATs is about empowering tenants, but the Secretary of State is answerable to Parliament and to the taxpayer for the large sums that will be used on such estates. It is therefore reasonable to expect HAT boards to maintain a balance. There are 11 places on the Castle Vale HAT board. Five of them will be taken by people nominated by the Secretary of State, four by people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1992-1993V010P0I0405">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
nominated by tenants and two will go to councillors. Indeed, one of the tenants' representatives is an owner-occupier, to reflect the diversity on the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Likewise, on the Tower Hamlets HAT board there will be four tenants, one representative of the local council and five others. Each estate will have a representative. We should bear in mind the fact that the composition of the boards was fully considered by tenants when they determined whether they wanted a HAT on their estate. As the hon. Member for Erdington said, the proposals for Castle Vale received a thundering welcome and the proposals for Tower Hamlets received a resounding welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the Committee's consideration of these matters, I have repeated the assurances and reassurances that were given on previous occasions. Local people want HATs to go forward as quickly as possible. The orders will facilitate the next step in the process of HAT area designation. They will bring substantial investment to two areas in which there is run-down housing. We are determined to refurbish and regenerate those areas as quickly as possible, just as we are determined that people in every other part of the country should have a decent home in which to live. I hope that the Committee will approve the orders so that designation can take place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.23 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was interesting that the Minister would not let me intervene when he loosely tossed across the Floor the idea that the Opposition do not want to debate housing. If the Minister checks the diary, he will see that we have had only three or four Opposition days in the House since the Government managed to clog up the House of Commons for some nine months with the Maastricht debate. During those Opposition debates, we have been forced to debate the pit closures, the shutting down of post offices and, more importantly, the economy. I remind the Minister that the Leader of the Opposition's speech on the economy put the need for decent housing at the heart of that debate and reminded the Government—as we shall continue often to do—that 147,000 families in Britain are statutorily homeless, 68,000 families are in temporary accommodation and thousands of people are homeless. That comes back to the demand that we made even last night for more rented housing, which is precisely the point that my hon. Friends have made in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may think that I am ranging far from the narrow remit of the orders before us, but we must put them in some context, which is exactly what my hon. Friends have done. Although I do not want to be abusive to the Minister, I feel that there is almost a touch of arrogance when he speaks—the Government know it all, or are doing it all or have done it all. Sometimes, when I hear this Minister speak in public, I almost feel the need to suggest that there is a housing problem in Britain, because he does not believe that there is one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
When I pressed the Minister on how the estates will go back to local authorities, he gave an interesting reply which tied up with what my hon. Friends have said about government by piecemeal initiative—fragment, do it in bits, but do not have a policy. The Minister said that tenants would individually have a right to choose what to do. In practice, that would undermine tenants' and residents' organisations and associations. It would no longer be a collective act, as it was with the orginal ballot to decide whether to go into HATs. The Government's proposals will get tenants into the HAT, fragment them and send them back in different directions. The Government will then tell us that they favour tenant participation, tenant action, tenant say and tenant ownership and control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends have spelt out the matter eloquently. One of my colleagues used the phrase, "government by high profile intitiative". The two schemes are further examples of piecemeal, high-profile initiatives. I suggest that one, two or four HAT schemes do not constitute a strategy. As more initiatives are introduced, they expose the Government's threadbare housing policy. That is why my hon. Friends have spelt out the need for wider thinking about housing and a wider strategy. The Minister is keen to say that the scemes are all pilot schemes. We hear that about every scheme that is introduced by the Government. As the former Chancellor has suggested, the pilot light is on for 36 hours only.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are keen—as was the former Prime Minister—on homely, domestic, household images. I hope that the Minister listens to this debate and thinks about my hon. Friends' comments. We are not opposing the housing action trusts. We are not going to press this to a Division and vote against these orders. But we want HATs to be firmly placed in the context of a need for a housing strategy. We cannot cook a meal on a pilot light. Tenants are getting a rough deal from the Government because the Government do not have an overall strategy. We shall continue to demand one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
