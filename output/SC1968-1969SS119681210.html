<br><br><!-- lb -->
I very much doubt whether the great public outside will appreciate the significance of this Amendment, but this is the way we often do things in Committee. We start with a paving, drafting Amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
ment. The point made by myself and several hon. Gentlemen during the Second Reading debate was that we believed that the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State already had the powers for which he was asking, under the 1954 Act. This was strenuously denied by the Under-Secretary, although it is not unfair to say that he did not altogether carry the Committee with him. He maintains that the present Law Officers have advised him that the Bill gives the Government an authority which they do not have. Although this is contrary to the advice once given to us, it is a matter which we must accept and I will not say any more about that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Four positions have been taken up over this Bill. There is first the Government position. They wish to retain the present system with such an insignificant change, that is, the change described by the hon. Gentleman, flowing from this Bill that one has to split hairs to find and understand it. Secondly, there is the position of the Under-Secretary of State, which is different from that of the Government, because he quite clearly wants to fix 1973 as the appointed day, with no reservations. That is his personal wish about possible postponements. Thirdly, there is the position taken up by the R.S.P.C.A., which is unable to accept any of those balancing factors put forward by the right hon. Gentleman in 1965, and by several hon. Members on Second Reading. The R.S.P.C.A. wants the date of 1973 advanced, with no reservations. Lastly there is the position of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, which dislikes the Bill because under it the Secretary of State can advance the date of the ban without an alternative trap necessarily being available. The N.F.U. wants Clause 2(1)(
	<i>b</i>) made much more positive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not surprising that there are widely differing views on a matter which has been before Parliament, either in debate or Parliamentary Questions, many times over the last twenty years. Every Secretary of State during that period has had it before him and each has taken an identical line. In saying that, I include the present Secretary of State, so far as his most recently expressed view in Parliament goes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an endeavour to reach a workable compromise, entirely in line with all
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
that has been said by Government spokesmen in the course of six Parliamentsâ€”until the hon. Gentleman deviated from that line a fortnight agoâ€”we have put down these seven Amendments, all of which are closely linked. Without its companions, the intention of each one is destroyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be of benefit to the Committee if I make clear what it is we want to amend. The Bill proposes that the power of the Secretary of State to make an order, as he can and does, authorising the use of the gin trap for the catching of foxes and otters anywhere in Scotland, shall cease in a little over four years' time, on 1st April, 1973, subject always to the Secretary of State receiving the consent of Parliament to withdraw the Order before then, or, and this is a point which made a very much more severe impact upon the Committee, to postpone the withdrawal of the Secretary of State's powers indefinitely. On Second Reading, Clause 2(1)(
	<i>b</i>) got a pretty substantial mauling. Through these Amendments we seek to be much more positive and practical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been entirely consistent thinking during the last twenty years by all right hon. Gentlemen who have dealt with this problem, beginning with the right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) and coming down to the present Secretary of State. All have said that the only obstacle to following the lead set by England in 1948 has been one of geography and topography. As the present Secretary of State remarked three years ago, the banning of the gin would cause serious losses on our hills and sheepland, and he said that these factors had to be balanced. I am in complete agreement with that. I find it surprising that the hon. Gentleman departed from that doctrine on Second Reading by declaring his total indifference whether a humane alternative will replace the gin in 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments 2 and 3 would restrict the Secretary of State's authority, for permitting the use of the gin, which he at present uses in respect of the whole country, to the crofting counties and to the livestock rearing lands of the northern counties. It would no longer be permissible to use the gin for otters, but only for the catching of foxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Amendment No. 4 defines what are the crofting counties and it is unnecessary for me here to go through the list. It also defines the meaning of livestock-rearing land. This is well enough known in farming circles, but I might say that it is defined statutorily as land which consists predominantly of mountain, hill and heath. It therefore takes in those wide spaces of hill land which are outside the crofting counties but in which, to gas, shoot or snare foxes is an almost impossible proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 would have the effect of terminating the Secretary of State's right to authorise the use of the gin in the whole of the west of Scotland, that is, in the whole of Lowland Scotland, south of Argyll and Perthshire and Angus, as well as on the low ground of those northern counties, as from 1st April, 1970, rather than 1st April, 1973. It is perfectly practicable to do that in country which is more like the English countryside, where it is already banned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 6 removes the powers given to the Secretary of State in the Bill to advance or postpone the appointed day. As Amendment No. 5 advances this by three years, we think it unnecessary to allow for a further advance beyond that. Nor do we think that within the Lowlands of Scotland there is any need for postponement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendment to the Title is entirely consequential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen may ask why we are asking for the retention of the gin in the areas in the north till such time as the Secretary of State feels able to remove it. It is solely in order to retain the balance of the various factors involved, the killing of livestock by foxes on the one hand, the pain suffered by foxes in a gin on the other. It is the balance to which the right hon. Gentleman referred in 1965. There is no doubt that since he uttered those words things have got worse and the balance has gone further out of adjustment. I would have no quarrel with what the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel) said on Second Reading, that everyone can see that the fox population has increased since the Secretary of State said how important it was that we must keep the gin because of our geographical features.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
There are those who regard myself and others as last-ditchers, trying to hang on to the gin trap, if not in the whole of Scotland then in the Highlands and in the hills. We approach it from the other angle, and want to forbid its use over as large an area as possible, and to retain it only where absolutely necessary. My calculations have led me to understand that the effect of the Amendments would be to limit its use to an area of no more than half the land surface of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. W. H. K. Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to support these Amendments, and I wish to address my remarks specifically to Amendments Nos. 3 and 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the problems which we have to face is the undoubted increase in the population of foxes. I have some figures which will be of interest to the Committee and will reinforce my hon. Friend's argument. My first figure relates to the kills of adult foxes and cubs in Aberdeen, Banff and Kincardine from 1962 to 1967. The North Eastern Agricultural Committee runs a fox destruction scheme, and the figures for each year are from 1st April to 31st March. In 1962â€“63, the number of kills was 588. In 1963â€“64, it was 748. In 1964â€“65, it was 694. In 1965â€“66, it was 798. In 1966â€“67, it was 900. In that period of five years there has been an increase in the number of killings of no less than 65 per cent., and I should have thought that that was a measure of the increase in the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also obtained a breakdown of the killings of foxes in Banffshire. These Amendments refer to the crofting counties and livestock rearing land. From the figures that I have been given, I cannot delineate the livestock rearing land in my constituency, so I have done it on the basis of parishes. That gives a rough and ready measure of the kills in that part of the county, as opposed to the lowland part. In 1963â€“64, the total kills in Banffshire were 283. On the livestock rearing land parishes, if I may so call them, there were 193 kills, or 68 per cent. of the total. In 1964â€“65, the total was 199. The number in the livestock rearing parishes was 139. In 1967â€“68, there were total killings of 312, of which 253 were in the uplands. The percentage in each case was 68, 70 and 81.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
It would seem from those figures alone that the foxes are being driven from the lowlands to the uplands. That may be an over-simplification of the problem, but it looks as if that is what is happening. I should also point out that, in the lowland areas in the northern part of the county, parts are still keepered. Most of the ground in the centre of the lowland area is adequately covered by this means. I think that those figures underline the necessity for the Amendments, especially Nos. 3 and 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Archie Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Looking at the position realistically and recognising that the results of accepting the main group of Amendments is to divide Scotland, I think that they should be rejected. We cannot contain foxes in this way. I cannot say for certain, of course, but from my own observations it is clear that there has been a very large increase in the fox population in the southern counties of Scotland. I know Ayrshire best, and undoubtedly there has been a great increase there. Whether it has been even greater in the crofting counties, I cannot say. I accept that there has been an increase, and I know that the increases in the southern counties can be easily proved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the basis of the figure of killings which the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) gave the Committee, I do not think that he will claim that all were from the use of the spring trap. Many were shot, which is the commonest method and, I think, the best. There are other methods which may kill the odd fox or two, but people who are keen to prevent suffering among all animals are seriously perturbed by the intention of hon. Gentlemen opposite to divide Scotland in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will have received a letter from the Central Council of Societies in Scotland for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. It is dated 6th December, and I think that it should be put on record. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Agriculture (Spring Traps) (Scotland) Bill. Further to my letter of 19th November, this Council notes with concern the tabling of an Amendment to this Bill which, while it would ban the trap completely in the South of Scotland, proposes to allow its continued use for foxes in the crofting counties and Highlands until an effective substitute can be found."</p></blockquote>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reading what is in the letter. Hon. Gentlemen opposite cannot complain about this. If their Amendments do not convey common sense to knowledgeable people outside, it is their own fault. The letter goes no:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Humane Traps Panel has spent ten years in trying to find a suitable substituteâ€”with no success. It is surely unlikely that one will be found in the near futureâ€”if at all."</p></blockquote>
I do not think hon. Gentlemen opposite would want to ban it if a substitute were not found.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Amendment providing for the gin trap's continued use in the north of Scotland would condemn foxes there to deplorable suffering indefinitely. It would thus defeat the main object of the Bill, which is to enforce a complete ban throughout the country of a trap, of which the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland said in the Scottish Grand Committee on 26th November, 'â€¦ it is not right to continue this excessively cruel method of capture when there are other ways of taking and getting rid of foxes'. The Council earnestly hopes that Parliament will support the Bill's proposal to ban the gin trap completely and that the effective date of this total ban will be not later than two years after the passing of the Act."</p></blockquote>
That is a body of opinion which should not be dismissed too lightly as coming from a set of people who are soft-hearted, or anything of that kind. There are some very distinguished people in the ranks of that organisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that we have to control foxes effectively, but there are large areas of hill country in the north where I do not know whether the gin trap is being used. Foxes are shot, and terriers are used to kill them. In certain areas, the trap is not relied upon to the extent that hon. Gentlemen opposite would have us think.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Amendment were successful, I do not think that it would restrict the hunting of foxes with hounds accompanied by frenzied people who want to be in at the kill and get the tail. I think in many ways that that encourages the breeding of foxes. Successful meets are held in the southern counties and attended by a large number of people who are more likely to be friends of hon. Gentle-opposite than of ours. We do not ride horseback much, anyway, even if we did when we were younger. I understand that there is a thrill in it. However, I doubt whether the fox finds it very thrilling. If this Amendment were accepted, it would
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
allow foxes to multiply in the southern counties where fox hunting is indulged inâ€”and it is an indulgence. It is not indulged in in the crofting counties, so far as I know. In the upland areas, there is more natural ground for foxes, but I do not regard this Amendment as providing any solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will accept this group of Amendments. Taken together, they give him an opportunity to introduce some sense into the Bill which, as it stands, is not the proposal which many people outside the House think it to be. I do not think that many realise that the Bill proposes simply that spring traps, including the gin trap, should be abolished in Scotland from 1973 or possibly some date thereafter. Although I recognise that it is the Minister's hope that it will be abolished completely in 1973 and possibly before, the Bill does no more than give the Government power at some uncertain date in the future to abolish the trap. We are not discussing a proposal which is designed to remove a trap which we all dislike at an early date. It is important to make that clear, and it is all the more important to understand it because only then do the Amendments take their proper perspective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments would have the effect of getting rid of the gin trap in a large part of Scotland in 1970. From the point of view of humanity, surely the Amendments are infinitely preferable to the vagueâ€”sometime in the future, if everâ€”content of the Bill. It is proposed that the traps could continue to be allowed as a legal instrument on high ground. Much as I regret the need for that, it is a real need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister would clarify even more than he did on Second Reading the progress which has been made in the development of some alternative method of controlling foxes. There has been a lot of talk about what the Minister referred to as reproductive inhibitors, which were called simply "the pill" in our proceedings. The Minister made it clear that the development of any method of this kind was a matter for the future. I look at the proposal with a good deal of disbelief. In the first place, if some sort of pill for foxes is to be developed, how will it be administered? Are we to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
scatter pills round the Highlands for them to devour? Might we not discover that, by accident, the reproductive inhibitor for foxes has the same effect on ewes? The right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) suggested that, in time, foxes might come to understand that the pills were good for them and would be only too willing to take them when they were administered to them. At that point, I made my only intervention, and I asked him how one would get the fox to the clinic. The point of that intervention is, that if one has to catch a fox to give it a pill, surely it would be easier to hit it on the head.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This extraordinary talk about pills for foxes has taken us down an avenue of fruitless discussion which has wasted a lot of time and raised false hopes. Surely we should consider controlling the fox population by methods such as shooting, gassing, hunting or trapping. There is no other real alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the extreme cruelty of the trap. I was reading "Country Notes" in the December issue of "Scottish Field". This article by "Fieldsman" is about the gin trap, and it was written without any knowledge of the Government's intention to introduce this Bill. He describes evocatively what the trap can do. He mentions that eagles, buzzards, ravens, dogs and cats are sometimes caught in them. He goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I have seen a working collie caught in a gin like this, during the course of its proper, legal, everyday work. I once found a roebuck clanking along with a gin on his leg, and tried unsuccessfully to shoot him. I have found a roe fawn dead in one. Footless pheasants, maimed hares, limping dogs, and cats with three legs and a fore-stump are often ex-victims of a gin. I know a cat that had two fore-stumps, having been caught twice. It was a cottage cat that had been mousing on the wrong side of the garden hedge."</p></blockquote>
Of course, this terrible cruelty continues, and therefore I am glad that one effect of my hon. Friend's proposals would be to get rid of it completely and quickly in a large part of Scotland. They are a real advance in terms of kindness and humanity over the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: It makes nonsense of nothing. The Amendment puts sense into the Bill. It is the Bill as it stands which is nonsense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A letter written by the National Farmers' Union of Scotland, which all hon. Members have received, shows why it is necessary to continue the use of the trap, horrible though it is, in the hill lands. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The fox is a very difficult animal to control, and the gin trap has proved the most effective method, especially in the Highlands, where it is found that a gin trap used in an island set is the best means of keeping down fox numbers."</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman's intervention suggested that we were advocating kindness in the lowlands and cruelty in the Highlands. We are suggesting the end of cruelty in the lowlands and the maintenance of this instrument in the Highlands for a very real need. In the Highlands, in particular, where sheep and lambs are at the mercy of foxes, there is no proper method of control of foxes yet. If we remove what the farmers regard as the most effective form of control the fox population will multiply even more than it is now. Cruelty, and damage to the land also, will increase. It is difficult to balance forms of cruelty, but the agony caused to the lamb attacked by the fox is possibly no less than that caused to the fox caught in the gin trap.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The Minister now has the opportunity of going at least some way towards meeting the argument rightly advanced outside the House for some way of reducing the cruelty of this instrument. I very much hope that he will accept the Amendments, which will have the effect of abolishing the gin trap over the larger part of Scotland, and very much sooner than the Government's most optimistic forecast. They would have the effect of continuing its use in the Highlands, just as it might be continued under the Bill. It is very likely that by not accepting the Amendment the Government might find themselves obliged to continue the use of gin traps in Scotland through the lack of development of an alternative method of control. On balance, therefore, the Amendments are on the side of humanity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) was rather apologetic in moving the first Amendment, to insert "(1)". He said that people might not realise its significance, but we have had very interesting debates here even on inserting commas, which have been rather important, and we have been able to talk profoundly about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today's debate suggests that this is quite an important series of Amendments. As I said on Second Reading, it is clear that everyone recognises that the gin trap is a cruel means of catching foxes, but there are difficult problems in connection with its abolition. When the Bill was referred to the House, the House approved it. In other words, it decided that we should do something to abolish the gin trap, and we must, therefore, ask ourselves whether we should do so over the whole of Scotland. I have listened to the debate carefully. There have been three speeches in favour of this, none of which has dealt with the fact that the gin trap has been abolished in England and Wales for a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are areas in England and Wales, especially in Wales, where conditions are almost akin to those in areas in Scotland. Nobody has said, "Here we have had an experiment carried out for ten years. These are the results." That would have been an important argument. I have often argued that one reason why
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I believe it is a good thing for Scotland to have its independent legislation is that it allows different courses to be pursued north and south of the Border. One can compare the results, with Benefit to England, which might wish to copy what Scotland is doing, or with benefit to Scotland, which might want to copy what England and Wales are doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows that one thing I deplore is repetition. This was fairly fully dealt with on Second Reading.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a separate debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was said on Second Reading was not to the effect that the evidence was overwhelmingly in favour of the retention of the gin trap. I think that what was said was that there was an increase in the number of foxes. But there is an increase in their number in Scotland in spite of the gip trap, so that is not an argument for retention. We have an increase in one case with the gin trap and in another without it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One probable reason for the increase is the lack of vigour with which the fox is pursued. I do not want to go into all the reasons. It is not necessarily that the fox is preserved, but many animals in rural areas are not pursued with the same vigour as they were at one time, and birds of various kinds are not pursued. Pigeons were shot right, left and centre at one time, but now one cannot move for them. The reason is the changing habits of the rural population. I know of no case where men in pursuit of animals have not succeeded in almost exterminating them. This is one of the problems of the world today. We have wild life preservation societies of every kind to preserve the few remaining specimens of different species.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your Ruling, Sir Myer. I was mentioning rabbits to reinforce a point I wanted to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting thing about rabbits is that, I believe, it is illegal deliberately to spread myxomatosis. In other words, we have tried to prevent something which we consider to be cruel, although everyone knows that it is the most effective method yet devised of dealing with rabbits. In spite of its effectiveness and the damage done by rabbits, the House has decided that that method should be illegal. That is very relevant to my point that because the gin trap is effective that does not mean that we should not abolish it. We have taken our stand in the case of myxomatosis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to try to divide Scotland into two. Either we abolish the gin trap or we do not. The House having decided to abolish it, we should accept that that should be accepted all over Scotland. I know the problem of the Highlands, that there are areas where it is difficult to deal with foxes, but we should not try to divide Scotland. Foxes do not know which is the "livestock rearing land". The hon. Gentleman spoke about the difficulty of teaching foxes how to use the pill. But it would be equally difficult to teach them the difference between ordinary and livestock rearing land. This is nonsense. With determination and willingness to spent a little time, it will be possible to deal with the fox as other animals have been dealt with.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our Amendment gives the right hon. Gentleman half what he wants.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Willis</div> <!-- member -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Having made the decision, we should stick to it. It might encourage a much more virile pursuit of the fox and cause a greater concentration of thought to keeping the fox population down. That would result in much more vigorous steps being taken to keep the fox under control than are now being taken. Therefore, it would be wrong to try to divide Scotland in the way suggested, particularly when it comes to defining the livestock rearing lands. I know that that term would include most of the counties mentioned, but the Highland area is a specific area, and this definition of other areas is not very well known. It is wrong to make such a division in a relatively small country like Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us do one thing or the other. Let us abolish the gin trap and see what happens. I would not support the Amendments unless there were much more evidence than has been adduced in the Committee that the effects of abolition have been disastrous in England, that after ten years' experience England is now thinking of reintroducing the gin trap. That would be a very effective argument, but nothing of the kind is happening. I hear of no great pressures in England and Wales for its reintroduction. Therefore, those countries must have solved the problem in areas which are very similar to Scotland.

If the people involved put their minds to it and give the energy and time the problem deserves, we could do the same, and everyone would be glad to see this cruel method of catching foxes abolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The powers already exist under the Agriculture (Scotland) Act and the Pests Acts for the Secretary of State to abolish the gin trap whenever he likes. Therefore, we would get rid of the gin trap by 1970 in at least half of Scotland and the Secretary of State could abolish it in the rest of the area at any period he likedâ€”before 1973, if necessary.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Gentlemen opposite have complained about the idea of dividing Scotland in this matter. Scotland has already been divided by God geographically and geophysically. It is the geographical considerations with which we are concerned today. Because the terrain in parts of Scotland is wild and rugged it is more difficult to control foxes. This is a good argument for abolishing the use of the gin trap as soon as possible over large parts of Scotland which are in many respects similar to parts of England, where the gin trap has already been abolished and where I have discovered, from my inquiries, there has been virtually no lobby to try to bring it back. If these parts of England can survive and control fox populations without the gin trap, places in the north of England and the Lake District, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
parts of Wales, we can do the same, particularly in the south of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why hon. Gentlemen opposite who argue the humane point of view should appear at this stage to oppose the Amendment, which seeks to remove the gin trap from a large area of Scotland sooner than would otherwise be the case under the Bill. Why do they want the whole fox population in the south of Scotland to go on suffering from the gin trap? Do they wish to produce some sort of unity among foxes?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's Amendment is a sensible and humane Amendment which will do what most of us want to do earlier than the Bill proposes, and that is to get rid of the gin trap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There has been a great increase in the fox population in the southern counties. Had I been arguing for the retention of the gin trap, I would have argued that it was more necessary to keep it in the southern counties, although I do not, of course, agree with that way of controlling foxes. However, there are more sheep to the acre in the southern than in the Highland counties and I suggest that some of the hon. Gentleman's farmer friends would not agree with the case he is making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Earl of Dalkeith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not absolutely convinced that the hon. Gentleman is mathematically correct in saying that there has been a large increase in the fox population in the south. His argument might apply to certain parts of southern Scotland, perhaps in areas where there are large Forestry Commission woodlands, but over large parts of which I have intimate knowledge the fox population has declined, I would say, rather than increased in Dumfriesshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk. This has come about not so much as a result of the gin trap but because of more efficient methods such as gassing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to the question of considering alternative means of doing the deed and reducing the fox population. I believe that gassing is more humane. Reference has been made to shooting foxes as an alternative, but we must be careful when considering this method. I have seen innumerable foxes in the process of dying of gunshot wounds, suffering from gangrenous infection and so on.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
It is probably no exaggeration to say that for every fox shot outright, six or seven are wounded. From my own observations I think that is a fairly reliable figure. Foxes are very tough animals with very tough fur; bullets do not penetrate it easily, and one must shoot fox either in the head or neck to kill it outright. This raises the question of whether shooting foxes should be forbiddenâ€”that is, unless there is some way of ensuring that marksmen qualify as shooting straight; because I honestly do believe shooting can cause almost as much suffering as the gin trap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If hon. Gentlemen opposite insist on keeping the gin trap for the length of time they seem to want to keep it, there is a strong case for the Minister introducing stricter regulations for the inspection of gin traps. Much suffering is caused to animals because of the length of time they remain trapped. Does the Minister intend to introduce regulations to ensure that anybody who sets a trap must inspect it within a certain number of hours? I do not know whether this would be feasible but it is something the Under Secretary should look at.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a townsman I hesitate to intervene in the discussion. I have been brought to my feet because, having listened to the arguments of hon.

In my innocence I thought that the Bill was designed to abolish the gin trap altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
However, two views have been expresed: some hon. Members want to abolish the gin trap while others wish to delay its abolition. If there is a principle involved in banning the use of the gin trap, it surely cannot be right to ban it in one part of Scotland and allow it to continue, albeit for a certain time, in another. It should either be banned entirely or allowed. It has been banned south of the Border and I have not heard great demands for the gin trap to be reintroduced. It therefore seems wrong for hon. Gentlemen opposite to table this sort of Amendment, bearing in mind the practical difficulties involved and the atrocities which foxes suffer as a result of the use of this instrument. We should not forget that not only foxes but domestic and other animals are caught in gin traps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How can it be cruel to use a gin trap in one part of Scotland but not cruel in another? Are we being kinder to one set of animals? This reminds me of the comment of a former hon. Member, recounted by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart), who wondered whether foxes could read notices.

There is no great principle involved in the Bill. It is simply a matter of policy.

So is the Bill, despite what he said. Abolition will take place in 1973 whether or not other approved instruments are available. The hon. Gentleman knows as well as all hon. Members that the Clause is a saving provision similar to provisions in most Measures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever the pros and cons, why cannot we make up our minds one way or the other? Either the trap must go throughout Scotland or it must stay. Whether one talks of cruelty, preservation of anything else, it cannot be right to retain it in one part of Scotland and abolish it in another. Hon. Gentlemen opposite should have the courage to say that it should be abolished throughout Scotland in 1973. A certain interim period must be allowed before it is abolished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hutchison</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to see the gin trap abolished throughout Scotland immediately. Tomorrow would not be soon enough for me.

A former hon. Member of the House, who represented Ayr Burghs, Sir Thomas More, was against the gin trap. One day in the House he demonstrated the use of a more humane instrument for killing animals. He held the instrument in his hand and pointed it at his temple, whereupon a wag on the Opposition benches, Will Crookes, exclaimed, "My God, he's missed." The Opposition, by tabling this series of Amendments, are doing precisely the same thing. They have missed the point of the argument. I deplore Scotland being divided in two in an effort to retain a weapon which all humane people should want abolished. Hon. Gentlemen opposite should either agree to its abolition or have the courage to say that they want the gin trap retained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Whether or not a principle is involved, would the hon. Gentleman explain the difference between England and Scotland in this matter? In 1948 the Government of the day abolished the gin trap for a part of the United Kingdom. The whole of Scotland was left out of that abolition because it was considered geographically unsuitable for abolition purposes. My hon. Friends and I wish to do no more than extend the principle which was begun in 1948, and the hon. Gentleman must surely support our desire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman compounds his discourtesy to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an extremely serious problem in the Highlands, and it is one about which I have received a great many representations. The right hon. Member also represents a Highland constituency, and I hope that he will give us the views of the Highlands, as he interprets them. The debate has demonstrated that there is no principle in the group of Amendments that we are discussing. The Opposition are prepared, when speaking to one set of people, to recognise the cruelty of the gin trap in one geographical context, but not to regard it as an overwhelming argument in another geographical context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not an argument of principle, and I regret that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) should have put his name to the Amendment. He seems to have done so under the misapprehension that it has the advantage of bringing closer the end which he desires. It seems, from my reading of the Bill, that the Amendment waters it down in that it does not set a date for the final abolition of the trap throughout Scotland. On Second Reading I questioned the wisdom of introducing a Bill with a permissive Clause, allowing the Secretary of State to postpone the date four years in advance of the appointed day. I adhere to that view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Bill has an importance, it is its effect in concentrating the minds of those seeking to devise alternative means of killing upon the need to do so quickly. I would regret it if the Bill were passed in an amended form, because it would mean that the gin trap would continue to be used widely throughout an area considerably more than half the total area of Scotland. The seven crofting countries alone constitute 47 per cent.; of the land mass of Scotland. If one adds Moray and Nairn, Banff and Aberdeenshireâ€”</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect, not the counties, but the hill areas in those
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
counties. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I went to the trouble of taking out Whitaker and adding up the area county by county. The answer is almost 50 per cent. of the land mass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that the total land mass of the seven crofting counties plus the counties of Moray and Nairn, Banff, Aberdeen and Perth is not more than half the land mass of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will repeat what is not in the Amendment. It is the hill areas of those counties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This requires clarification. Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the addition of the land mass of the Highlands, plus the hill areas of these counties, add up to 50 per cent. of Scotland? Can he break down the figures, because he has confused the Committee, just as these Amendments have confused it, utterly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Alick Buchanan-Smith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nonsense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would entail going into a very great amount of detail. I have a list here of the areas, as extracted from 
	<i>Whitaker's Almanack</i> of the counties. I have done an admittedly rough calculation of how much of the counties to which the livestock area referred, is livestock area. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the answer is not far from 50 per cent. It is not exactly that figure, but it is very nearly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that derogates from the general line in my argument, which is that this is driving a considerable wedge into the principle of the abolition of the gin, if we are to retain it indefinitely throughout even 50 per cent. of Scotland. I find it rather difficult to accept this, knowing the size of the counties involved and the amount of agriculture carried on there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more substantial objection to the group of Amendments is that they have not been proposed on the basis of any scientific evidence. On Second Reading it was acknowledged that the fox is a peculiarly serious problem in the Highlands. I was interested to hear the figures given then by the hon. Member for Banff (Mr. W. H. K. Baker) about the numbers of foxes for which payment has been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
made by the Highland Agricultural Executive Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Baker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures I quoted on Second Reading were for the three counties 
	<i>in toto</i>. The figures in detail which I gave this morning were for the county of Banff alone.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maclennan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Member for Ross and Cromarty (Mr. Alasdair Mackenzie) gave figures for two counties during the Second Reading debate. One set was for the county I represent. There is certainly a serious problem, but what has not been shown is the position in the counties which it is proposed to exclude. In the absence of rather more scientific evidence there is no substantial case for dividing Scotland in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that there is some explanation, which the hon. Member for North Angus and Mearns (Mr. Buchanan-Smith) would advance, for the exclusion of Kincardineshire. I cannot see why Stirlingshire and Clackmannanshire have been left out. We have heard of the serious problem in both these areas. This is rather an illogical series of Amendments. I take exception to them on the grounds that we have not had sufficient evidence that this group of counties has a problem very different in scale or kind from that prevailing in, for example, the south-west, in Galloway, and certain other Border counties, or in certain agricultural areas in the centre of Scotland. Secondly, I believe that it derogates from the principle of abolition in the listed counties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The merit of the Bill is that it provides a terminal date for the operation of gin. It should have the effect of concentrating the minds of those who seek to devise a humane trap, of those who may gain commercially by doing so. I hope that we will reject this Amendment on those grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Small</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the Amendments, which if carried would be restrictive on geographical grounds. I am thinking of the term "gin trap" and the term "spring trap" but they are all spring traps. I do not see why we should not change over from one word to another and make that legal. Take for example the Forestry Commission. Its personnel may find themselves in some difficulty in that they may be allowed
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
to use the trap in certain areas and not in others. We are talking about policy, as the right hon. Gentleman said. This is a process of selectivity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Forestry Commission does not use the gin trap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Small</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was reading the Report of the previous debate, which dealt with the Commission's range of activities. I am pleased to hear the Commission is not involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this was abolished ten years ago in England and Wales, the principle of universality adopted without any selectivity, save for the exemption of Scotland, then it is reasonable now to have universality of application throughout Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been an extremely interesting discussion. To some extent the number of points put forward by hon. Members opposite do not indicate a very enthusiastic desire on their part to ensure that the Bill receives a speedy passage. I suspect that some of the Amendments reflect this, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite have put themselves into a logical difficulty. The intention in the Amendments is to extend the powers of our first Clause which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"After the appointed day it shall no longer be competent â€¦"</p></blockquote>
They would have it read that after the appointed day it shall no longer be competent to authorise this trap in a series of areas. By the second part of their Amendments they would wipe out the last half of the Clause, which establishes the power to withdraw it. The two things are, as James Joyce used to say, mutually exclusive. The Amendments would leave the Clause in a contradictory state, by providing that, from the appointed day the Secretary of State could authorise the use, in stated areas, of traps other than approved traps, while at the same time removing from that day the power enabling him to grant such authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are more basic difficulties. I agree with those who say that a case has not been made out for creating a distinction between two areas of Scotland. I thought that our common aim in the Second Reading debate was to end
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
cruelty. I cannot agree that there is no principle involved here. It is that we should abolish cruelty, on basic humanitarian grounds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Bill, as it stands, does not abolish it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will come to that in a moment. We are not doing this for efficiency or convenience, but on humanitarian grounds. We all recognise that there will be practical difficulties. This is what the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) meant this morning, in his rather inaccurate and slighting reference to what I had said earlier, namely that I was not concerned whether a humane alternative was discovered. I was saying that whether or not one were found we were all, I thought, agreed in principle, that on humanitarian grounds the gin trap should be abolished. If that is not principle, the Amendments drive a horse and cart through it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They say that in areas where this would create difficulty, abolition should not take place. This is not the principle upon which the Bill is founded. It is founded upon the principle of abolition for humanitarian reasons, whether or not difficulties are created. Therefore, there must be a basic difference between us on principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am surprised that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) was seduced into supporting the Amendments because of the introduction of the year 1970 in the easier areas. I accept that he is concerned to see gin traps abolished now and that he welcomes the Amendments because they provide for abolition in parts of Scotland, but, with respect, he goes wrong in welcoming the abolition in the smaller area of Scotland now as opposed to waiting for three to four years for abolition in the whole of Scotland. Three or four years is not all that long after such a period of time, if it means total abolition then rather than partial abolition now. The problem has been with us for a long time, and it is apparent from the Amendment that there is no intention to extend the 1970 abolition to other areas of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Brewis</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to take that as an undertaking that the gin trap will be
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring to the two Amendments that we are discussing. My attitude about 1973 is to be challenged forcibly by an Amendment which has been put down by my hon. Friends, and it will be discussed later. I am arguing that it is a poor bargain for those who want total abolition to accept 1970 as the date for dealing with the lesser part of the problem and in exchange, to discard the possibility of abolition of the trap in the greater area of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the possibility of abolition by 1973, and that confirms what we have been saying all morning. This Bill is extremely vague in contrast with our Amendments, which provide for the abolition of the trap in much of Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sticking to the Amendments, in which the abolition of the gin trap is effectively prevented in that area of Scotland where the problem is greatest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In what way do they effectively prevent abolition, when for those areas it maintains the 
	<i>status quo</i>, meaning that the Secretary of State can order abolition at any time?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That pushes us to the point of discussing whether there is any need for this Measure. I thought that the view of hon. Gentlemen opposite was that they still thought that they were right and that legislation was not necessary, but that, if the Government felt that it was, they would accept the point. Indeed, they have accepted the point that legislation is needed by putting down these Amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our aim is to try to clarify the hon. Gentleman's mind. I was unable to be present when we discussed this on Second Reading, but I read what hon. Members had to say about it, and almost everyone disagreed with the Minister in his interpretation of what the Bill meant. In spite of that, the Government have produced the same Bill for consideration in Committee. In view of that, we are bound to assume that the Government believe that they are right, and to act on that assumption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Gentlemen opposite ask why we decided legislation was necessary when their advice when they were in office was that it was not necessary. There are two points that I would make, in reply to that. The first is that a Government must not only listen to advice, but make decisions based upon that advice. It may be that, when hon. Gentlemen opposite were in office, they made their own decisions. My second point is that they know that I have no means of assessing the nature of the advice that they received. If they made that decision, we think that they were wrong. We cannot accept their decision as being sacrosanct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a modest and humble man. There were such confident assertions from hon. Gentlemen opposite that I was wrong that I made investigations and sought legal advice. My advice is exactly the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They will remember the history of the legislation. I will not go into all of it, though I might be tempted to. There was the 1948 Act, and then the Pests Act, 1954. Section 50(5) of the Agriculture (Scotland) Act, 1948, as re-enacted by the Pests Act, 1954, provides that the Secretary of State may withdraw authority for the use of traps other than approved traps if he is satisfied, having regard to the quantities of approved traps available at reasonable prices that it is expedient to do so, and, when he is satisfied that the power to authorise the use of traps other than approved traps is no longer necessary, withdraw all subsisting authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is accepted on all sides that a suitable alternative has not come forward, and therefore, that condition is not fulfilled. The argument is also put forward that the problem is increasing, in which case it cannot be said that the use of traps other than approved traps is no longer necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The circumstances have not changed. When I consulted the Law Officers, they said that in a situation where there are no approved traps suitable for catching foxes and otters and where there has been no other relevant change in the circumstances since 1958, it would not be safe to rely on existing powers under the 1948 Act either to revoke the present authority for the use of unapproved traps against foxes and otters, or to withdraw completely the
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
power to grant such authority. Thus there would be a distinct possibility that the force of such action could be challenged successfully in the courts. That is why we have brought forward legislation. In the face of that advice, it would have been wrong for the Secretary of State to attempt to use his 1948 Act powers, and therefore the Bill is necessary. Thus the problem is left squarely before hon. Gentlemen who wish to have a fixed and definite abolition legislation is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason I ask hon. Gentlemen opposite who want abolition to reject this set of Amendments, because the idea of bringing in the date 1970 for solving the smaller problem in Scotland is basically an attempt to preserve it indefinitely. That is why I say that the Amendments are designed to prevent the abolition of the gin trap.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. MacArthur</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that these Amendments have been brought forward and the length at which they have been argued by hon. Gentlemen opposite shows that they wish to hold up abolition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having made clear the case for the necessity of legislation, I want to come now to the argument about the various areas in Scotland. As the Committee knows, the Scottish Landowners' Federation and the National Farmers' Union co-operated in a survey carried out in 1965â€“66 of the methods used to control foxes in Scotland. This indicated that some 3,400 foxes were taken with the gin during the period covered by the survey. Of these, about 1,300 were taken in the Highland area and about 800 in the counties of Moray, Nairn, Banff, Aberdeen, Angus and Perth. Hence, hon. Members opposite are arguing for an arrangement which would seem likely to cut by no more than two-fifths the number of foxes taken by this cruel method. There was an argument about the area of Scotland involved and whether or not it was 50 per cent. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
doubt the accuracy of the assessment of 50 per cent., but that does not matter basically for the purposes of this argument. The question is not which area of Scotland is bigger or smaller. What is important is the number of foxes likely to be taken. The area where hon. Gentlemen opposite propose abolition in 1970 covers only about two-fifths of the country. In other words, three-fifths of the country will remain in the area where hon. Gentlemen opposite say there should be no abolition. They are really saying that where three-fifths of the fox population is and where three-fifths of the foxes taken are killed, there should be no abolition. That is why the Amendments drive a horse and cart through the basic humanitarian principle and intention of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have pointed out already that the effect of the Amendments is to produce a self-contradictory effect in Clause 1. It would not make sense.

	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
They may wish to challenge the year 1973. They may wish to support my hon. Friends in their Amendment. However, that is for a later discussion. We are concerned with 1970 and whether we should divide Scotland in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is hedging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am not. How is the proposal of hon. Gentlemen opposite to be enforced if the borders of the areas concerned are as loosely defined as they are in their Amendments?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 1(3) of the Livestock Rearing Act, 1951, defines "livestock rearing land", and it is very complicated and difficult. It means
	<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦ land situated in an area consisting predominantly of mountains, hills or heath being land which is or by improvement could be made suitable for use for the breeding, rearing and maintenance of sheep or cattle but not for the carrying on to any material extent, of dairy farming, the production to any material extent, of fat sheep or fat cattle or the production of crops in quantity materially greater than that necessary to feed the number of sheep or cattle capable of being maintained on the land."</p></blockquote>
Someone will have to work all that out and decide whether he can put down a gin trap in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The practice and enforcement of it gives rise to enormous problems. If the gin could lawfully be used in certain areas for specified purposes, there would be a constant temptation for it to be used unlawfully elsewhere. If, for example, it were lawful to use the gin for foxes in livestock rearing areas in the counties specified in the Amendment, I think it very likely that, through ignorance of the law or otherwise, it would be used from time to time to control foxes elsewhere in those counties, and anyone using a gin for unlawful purposes in those areas where its use was authorised for taking foxes could readily claim that he had intended to take foxes and that any other creatures caught were taken accidentally. Thus we should remove one of the great elements of the law, which is that it should be simple and clearly understood. It would no longer be simple, and it would also be extremely difficult to enforce.

Friend to ban the gin trap in these areas only if a humane alternative became available. If we are right in our analysis of the 1948 Act, we could only abolish it in the Highland areas when a humane alternative became available. That is not satisfactory. We believe that the time has come to lay down a definite date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) said that there were four separate positions, and he made a distinction between the Government position and my own on this. But my position is the Government's. We fixed on the date of 1973, but argued that there should nevertheless be the possibility of bringing it forward, and also that an option should be left open to delay it. We would not want it used, but we could not predict the circumstances in four years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite have no case. Their Amendments have been an attempt to perpetuate a cruel and inhumane method in the greater area of Scotland where the gin trap is used. I understand the problems facing farmers as well as anyone. I understand the problem of the slaughter of lambs, which amounts to about 2,000, but we have to strike a balance. The specious solution put forward by hon. Members opposite is an attempt to avoid facing up to the problems of abolition, but it is necessary now to move.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a number of occasions I have heard the Minister talk nonsense to the Committee and waste time, but I have never heard him do both together so well as he did today. I think that I know the reason, but that is neither here nor there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly in the mind of every Member of the Committee that the gin trap is cruel and unpleasant. That is clear, and accepted, and was clear from what the Minister said, as he dodged from one foot to the other, saying he meant this and did not mean that and did not even tell the Committee what was in his mind because there was another Amendment to come. What a parody of a Minister! He accused hon. Members on this side of wasting time and not wanting to let the Bill through. The Chairman may well have noted the amount of time of speeches on both sides. It is the normal custom that the Opposi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
tion has rather more debating time than the Government because the Minister is explaining his case, and one presumes that he has explained it to his hon. Friends beforehand. The Minister complained that we were wasting time, but it is within his knowledge, because he has been a Minister for quite a while, that if one wants to speed up a discussion in Committee the Chairman never objects to a Minister saying that he intends to accept or refuse an Amendment that comes later. In that way the Committee knows what is in the Minister's mind, but the hon. Gentleman's mind was the most total fog, so far as he declared it to the Committee during the whole twenty minutes he spoke.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee is unanimous in thoroughly disliking the gin trap. There is no question about that. But it has been the policy of Governments of both sides, and of both countries, often to move in different ways in different areas. Therefore, I totally reject the suggestion of the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Manuel), supported by the Minister, that it is impossible to divide Scotland. That is rubbish, and he knows it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one divides Scotland, certain things happen. The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan), who was busy giving us legal phraseology but not a very clear idea of what was in his mind, said that there are specific problems in the Highlands. He asked us to provide all the statistical information that the Committee should have in order to come to a sensible decision. Does not it occur to him that the Government might do this? We have no statistical information from them of any use to us. My hon. Friend, who did his best from Whitaker to give as accurate a picture as he could of the division of Scotland, was attacked by the Minister, who did not tell us what it was. He clouded the issue by trying to read out a definition of the Act. It was accurate, but he did not tell the Committee that the areas have already been defined, so that there is no problem.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. That is the purpose of my speech, which has only just started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all dislike the gin trap and know that there are distinct problems in different parts of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there are parts of England and Wales where the same sort of conditions apply as in the north of Scotland, if I may use that expression loosely to cover the area of the Amendment. There are also areas in the south of Scotland, such as parts of south Ayrshire, Galloway and parts of the Borders, which are very like those one finds in Argyllshire, Perthshire and Caithness. But they are all much smaller. The whole point of the debate is, that in these areas it is very simple to make an accurate estimate of the number of foxes, because foxes are seen and damage is pinpointed in small areas that are populated pretty densely. There are vast tracts of land in the hon. Gentleman's constituency and mine where nobody goes near the hill for a month or two on end. There is no possibility of making an accurate estimate of how many foxes are there. They can move 15 or 20 miles, and do so regularly. Therefore, any attempt at an assessment of how many are there is likely to be out by several hundred per cent. Though the best figures we have been able to use in our discussion are the dead foxes, this is not a satisfactory method of deciding how many are alive. This is a basic problem that neither the Government nor Opposition can overcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The problem is not the actual areas the right hon. Gentleman is talking about but the extreme difficulty of their definition. The Amendment covers livestock rearing land in the counties of Moray, Nairn, Banff, Aberdeen, Angus and Perth. If we make this law, can the right hon. Gentleman imagine the difficulty of the village policeman in deciding the boundary of livestock rearing land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no difficulty. Every local constable would know what it is. If not, all he would have to do would be to ring up his headquarters and he would be told. The areas are defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Minister and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
Hannan) have a principle in their hearts. They want to prevent cruelty, but the Bill is to lay down policy, and the policy laid down is a little obscure. The purpose of the Amendments is to reduce the area of Scotland in which the gin trap is allowed, because it is a cruel weapon, and to maintain it in those areas where, in our view, that of every sheep farmer in them, and many other people, it is difficult or impossible to control foxes adequately without it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that difficulty had been keenly felt in Ayrshire, Galloway, Dumfries or other places, the farmers in those areas would have told us that they were not happy to have the gin trap abolished there. No such view has been expressed, though the Amendments have been given a good deal of publicity. I do not say that that means that everybody in those areas is happy, but if the number of foxes is increasing in them as people have said, there has been no demand from the farming communities there that the gin trap should be kept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caithenss and Sutherland and I, and other Highland Members who do not seem to be present, have a steady contact with our farming communities and they all tell us that they need the gin trap as a weapon to try to defeat the steady increase of foxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) said that he was confident that a more active attack on foxes would get rid of them. That is true, but the problem in the areas we are talking about is that there are steadily fewer and fewer shepherds and keepers. They are the people who controlled the foxes in the old days. The shepherd used to be expected to look after 300 or 400 ewes, but today in those areas he is probably looking after 700 or 800. That does not mean a greater density of sheep but a greater area he must cover. Keepers were common all over the Highland area in the past, but they have practically disappeared. The Forestry Commission is one of the few bodies in the area which maintains keepers, dotted about enormous area of ground, a great deal of it covered by woods and totally unable to keeper in the old sense of the word. Therefore, the protection against the fox menace has diminished and is continuing to diminish, due to economic pressures
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
and to there no longer being people wan-dering about in those hills doing little but keep down foxes and hooded crows. which are also very cruel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Amendments simply say that there is a large part of Scotland where we believe there is no pressure from the N.F.U. or others to keep the gin trap but that there is another part where there is that pressure for good economic reasons, and there must be a balance. There is too much talk about cruelty without defining whether it is to the fox, the lamb, the mouse or the cat. In the areas in the north of Scotland about which I am talking there will be a very tiny percentage of cats and dogs going into gin trapsâ€”I would hope practically none, because the traps are set in places where domestic animals are not wandering</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Amendment would remove from the Bill the words which say that the Secretary of State
	<br><blockquote><p>"may, whether an order has been made under the foregoing paragraph or not, from time to time by order postpone the appointed day for a period, or further period, of one year."</p></blockquote>
If the Amendment is accepted, the power of deferment will be removed from the Secretary of State. He will no longer be able to postpone the abolition beyond 1st April, 1973, while the Amendment will leave in the Clause his power to bring abolition forward at an earlier</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>

	<p>around. That is not true in the south, where the much higher density of population puts such animals much more at risk.</p>

	<p>I accept any argument that there is an element of cruelty in maintaining the gin trap in the north of Scotland, again using that phrase to cover the areas dealt with in the Amendments. But the Amendments mean the abolition of the gin trap in a large area of Scotland, an area more densely populated by humans, domestic animals and other creatures that may be affected. It is a sensible first step, and therefore I hope that the Committee will accept it.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put,</i> That the Amendment be made:â€”</p>

	<p>
	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 11, Noes 11.</p>

	<p>date than 1st April, 1973, if he can do it because other methods of controlling the fox population have been found.</p>

	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>

	<p>On Second Reading I maintained that in retaining the gin trap we were placing a value on it which I did not believe it possessed. I said that as England and Wales had banned it, we should do so tomorrow. The Amendment would not achieve that, but it would remove the provision in the Bill whereby the Secretary of State could defer the appointed day after 1973, on and on for years. We would, therefore, at least be limiting the period during which this cruel instrument might continue to be used in Scotland.</p>

	<p>Ministers have given assurances that a period will be allowed before the ban is implemented during which the interests affected can make preparations for controlling foxes without the gin trap. I accept that the Minister cannot go back on that. Nevertheless, I urge him to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1968-1969V006P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
accept that there is no reason to anticipate changes from present circumstances in the next three or four years which would make it less desirable than it is now to ban the use of this cruel weapon.</p>

	<p>I ask the Committee to be decisive today and to put a term on the period during which the use of the gin trap will be allowed. By the Amendment we would be gaining something, even though I criticised it on Second Reading. We should therefore make up our minds now; and if we cannot go forward before 1973, we should remove the chance of the period of delay being extended, and ensure that the Government will not be able to defer the abolition of the gin trap.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be helpful if I intervene at this stage. This question has obviously caused a great deal of heart searching by hon. Members both today and when we discussed the principle of the Bill. I have carefully considered the views put forward in the debate on the principle of the Bill and I am aware of the comments of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart). His remarks about postponement made a bigger impact on the Committee than his comments on any other point, although I would not agree with him when he said that the Minister had received a substantial mauling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still maintain that the intellectual position is impeccable; that we cannot predict with certainty the position in four years' time. That is why there seemed to be a case for deferment. Equally, there is a case for Ministers listening to the views of democracy, and the Committee has made it clear that hon. Members want a definite and absolute date laid down at which point the ban will become absolute throughout Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that this will disappoint many farmers in Scotland. I have read with care the letter which the N.F.U. sent me, among others, and I appreciate the anxieties which have been expressed. I assure hon. Members that I am not ignoring them to any extent. However, we must accept that the people of this country, their views having been expressed by hon. Members, want us to make the date absolute and to say that
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
the ban should be introduced by 1973; that is, either in 1973 or with power to advance the ban if circumstances warrant it. I am sure that I will please many hon. Members when I say that the Government are prepared to accept this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some grave misgivings were voiced, not only on this proposition but about the whole principle of the Bill, at Second Reading. The right hon. Member for East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) said in that debate that
	<br><blockquote><p>"â€¦ if the fox were allowed a free run "â€”</p></blockquote>
which is what it may largely mean in the Highland areasâ€”
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would interfere with food economics and with the production of lambs and cattle."</p></blockquote>
He went on to use stronger language than I would have used. With his great experience of these matters, he concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would be a disaster for agriculture."â€”[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Scottish Grand Committee</i>, 26th November, 1968; c. 18.]</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Manuel</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) referred to representations from farmers. He will have read the circular letter issued by the N.F.U. on 6th December, the last paragraph of which said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We would recommend that the Bill be amended to ensure that it does not come into effect before 1973. This would still leave the Secretary of State power to withdraw authorisation to use the gin trap before that if an effective humane trap were discovered before the appointed day; and after that the gin trap could be withdrawn whenever any satisfactory methods were found â€¦"</p></blockquote>
That indicated that the ban should not be introduced before 1973, and the Amendment satisfies that request.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Stodart</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certain that the N.F.U. would not, in any circumstances, agree that if, by 1973, there were no practical alternative, the gin trap should

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Buchan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us be clear about this. The hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (Mr. Stodart) is correct in saying that the Union disliked this part of the Bill.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made the position clear, although I was in some doubt about his intention at Second Reading. At first he said that this caveat must exist because something might go wrong in the coming four years. Then he said that it was the Government's intention to abolish the gin trap. He was inconsistent on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer him to three extracts in the OFFICIAL REPORT of our Second Reading proceedings in columns 42 and 43. His comments left me in grave doubt about the intention of the Government. He has cleared the position up today and has said that 1973 is the date, and nothing thereafter.

Various figures have been quoted. In the crofting counties and the northeastern areas, to which our earlier Amendments would have applied, 45 per cent. of foxes taken are caught in gin traps. In the northern and eastern counties, 61 per cent. are taken in gin traps. The numbers taken in the south are smaller, and we would have exempted those.

It is obvious that the Committee should reach a decision on this matter. I deprecate the suggestion that all our arguments have been about abolishing the use of the gin trap. Certainly that has been mentioned, but we have been far more concerned with trying to free as large an area as possible of the use of this instrument, retaining it solely because we believe that the effect of having no gin trap in those areas will be devastating to livestock.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
