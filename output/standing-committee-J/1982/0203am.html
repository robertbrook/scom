<div class='page-header'><h1>Police and Criminal Evidence Bill</h1></div>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett <span class='memberconstituency'>(Stockport, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English, I notice you have that selected one or two additional clauses in advance, but I suggest that, if we are to finish the Bill within this Parliament, and if we are to give all the clauses reasonable scrutiny as opposed to giving very careful scrutiny to only a few clauses, we should have a longer selection list in advance.<br><br>
We are in what might almost be described as a vicious circle. If you select only a clause or two in advance, some of my hon. Friends tend to put down amendments only a clause or two in advance. I suggest that, if you selected a little longer in advance, hon. Members might be encouraged to table amendments longer in advance. We could then make a more rational allocation of our time.<br><br>
I realise that, from the Front Bench, it is difficult to negotiate an agreed timetable for a Bill such as this. I do not argue that we should have an agreed timetable. It would help, however, if we had more idea from the provisional selection of amendments of the volume of work that lies before us so that we can make the best use of our time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning some of the difficulties involved. I think, however, that he has a misapprehension of what happens in the process of selection. Most selection is simply grouping.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman seems to think that most amendments are not selected, but the opposite is the case. Last Tuesday, when the hon. Gentleman was addressing the alternate Chairman, he said that there was little time left to prepare. I fear that, normally, the Chair does not rule out amendments, for obvious reasons, because they are tabled in order to be discussed.<br><br>
Amendments fail to be selected only for specific reasons, such as that they would make nonsense of the Bill if passed, that they are out of order or that they do not change the law.<br><br>
Generally speaking, if the hon. Gentleman is worried about making preparation for amendments, he should prepare for all of them because nearly all are likely to be selected. What happens is mainly a matter of grouping. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will understand that.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman and others have persistently suggested that we should progress faster if more amendments are selected. Alas, it does not necessarily always happen in that way.</span></p>

ENTRY AND SEARCH AFTER ARREST</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 156, in page 11, line 17, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsections (4) and (5) below,".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments:<br><br>
No. 157, in page 11, line 32, leave out subsections (4) and (5).<br><br>
No. 158, in page 12, line 1, leave out paragraph <i>(b).</i></span></p>
<p>10.35–40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is tabled in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for York (Mr. Lyon). I hoped that, by the time I had made that brief introduction, my hon. Friend would have appeared.<br><br>
All three amendments make the same point, which occurs three times in the clause. I assume that my hon. Friend tabled the amendment to probe why it was necessary to give special powers to search property when an arrest had been made without going through the safeguard procedure that exists for searching other property. Amendment No. 248 is linked to this, but in a slightly different way. I shall speak to that later.<br><br>
The Minister should make clear to the Committee why these special powers are being given when an individual is being arrested. I may not be advancing the same argument as my hon. Friend the Member for York, who I am pleased to see has arrived, but it seems to me that if a police officer is arresting a person who has committed an offence, the likelihood of someone removing the evidence is very small, so the same procedure that applies to search without arrest would have to be gone through for the arrest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Nantwich)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely that would be the very moment when the person's accomplices would take the opportunity of removing the evidence being sought.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question of whether there are accomplices also leads us to ask whether they should have been arrested. Assuming that more than one person is involved in the pattern, if it is a serious arrestable offence all those who are involved ought to be arrested.<br><br>
It is not necessary to have in clause 11a different power from that required to search. I should be grateful to the Minister for his comments. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for York will add a little to what I have said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon <span class='memberconstituency'>(York)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I read the order paper I almost forgot why I tabled the amendment. I am overwhelmed at the perspicacity of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) in addressing his arguments to it. Having listened to him, I remember why I did. As my hon. Friend on the Front Bench said, this is one occasion where the copy is better than the original.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) may be interested to know that, had I known all this in advance, I might not have selected the amendment.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0256">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That would have been a grave deficiency on the part of the Chair.<br><br>
This is quite a serious issue which covers many of the so-called checks which were recommended by the Royal Commission on criminal procedure and which have been built into the Bill.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor) in an intervention in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North asked what happens if the constable wants to make a search but is frightened that if he goes back for a search warrant the evidence will have disappeared. 1 suspect that that is the motive that prompted subsection (5). If that is so, the subsection is far too wide to cover such a situation, because it gives no indication of any restriction limiting the constable's discretion to an acute emergency.<br><br>
All that is required is that the constable should simply decide to make a search without a warrant. The only restriction upon him would be under subsection (5) which provides that he should inform an officer with the rank of inspector that he has made a search as soon as practicable after he has made it. The inspector would then have to make a record in writing of the grounds for the search and the nature of the evidence sought.<br><br>
That does not necessarily limit an immediate search to the example given by the hon. Member for Nantwich, where a police constable has come upon evidence that leads him to believe that he must make an immediate search or the evidence will be destroyed. I suspect that this subsection will be used widely to allow police officers to make searches without warrant when there is no justification not to apply for one. That is why I tabled the amendment.<br><br>
10.40–45 am<br><br>
I recognise that there may be an odd occasion when an officer has serious information which suggests that evidence might be destroyed if he applies for a warrant. However, one is only too aware, if only from American gangster films, of incidents when an officer stands on the doorstep and says, "I want to come in to make a search", the occupant replies, "You are not coming in here unless you get a warrant" and the officer retorts, "I will go and get a warrant unless you let me in right away but if I do- have to get one there will be trouble for you." I suspect that that type of pressure will be used by a police officer in general circumstances because he will be able to say to his inspector, "If I hadn't gone in then the evidence would have been destroyed."<br><br>
I believe that, because such incidents may occur, a qualification needs to be written into the subsection to ensure that they must be justified to the inspector and in the notes that would need to be made by him and the officer. In such circumstances the courts or defending counsel might be prepared to inquire into the matter which may give some tenuous control over the power. Even with that, I do not believe that it would be a very serious control, but we have been into that issue before. If control of the power is entended by the Government it should be more specific than what is proposed in subsection (4).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Home Office (Mr. Patrick Mayhew)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment and the two speeches that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
we have heard raise proper considerations and I believe that I can state the Government's position very briefly.<br><br>
There is no dispute in the Committee that there should be a power to search after somebody has been arrested, and that is subject to the safeguard set out in clause 11. We are concerned with whether there should be a special power for a police officer who has arrested somebody to search that person's premises before taking him to a police station, without the safeguard of the written authority of a more senior officer. I believe that it is conceded by the hon. Members for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) and for York (Mr. Lyon) that there are circumstances in which it would be proper for that emergency action, if I may so describe it, to be taken. I also believe that it is conceded that a practical point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nantwich (Sir N. Bonsor). There may be circumstances in which, unless a search is quickly made, the suspect's associates or confederates may destroy or conceal evidence that is relevant to the offence.<br><br>
Clause 22(2) has a bearing on the matter in that it demonstrates that the language of clause 11 needs tightening. Clause 22(2) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in subsection (l)above shall prevent a constable delaying taking a person who has been arrested to a police station if the presence of that person elsewhere is necessary for the effective investigation of an offence."</p></blockquote>
The subsection that we are discussing under the amendment needs tightening to reflect the language that I just quoted and I undertake to see that that will happen.<br><br>
In the course of re-examining the drafting I shall consider the points made by the hon. Members for York and for Stockport, North. The power is needed to prevent the immediate destruction or concealment of evidence and I shall consider whether it is possible and practicable expressly to limit the discretion in the clause to circumstances in which that eventuality is reasonably foreseen or suspected. If the hon. Member for York who moved the amendment vicariously is content with that, we shall proceed on that basis.</span></p>
<p>10.45–50 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I forget my reasons for moving an amendment, the Chair will see that my instincts are right and will call all my amendments in future, even if I cannot justify them.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister and I wish to withdraw my amendment.</span></p>
<p>10.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This particular Chairman always tries to be helpful to the law.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that my hon. Friend would withdraw the amendment, but I shall do it if that is necessary. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alfred Dubs <span class='memberconstituency'>(Battersea, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 248, in page 11, line 32, at beginning, insert
<br><blockquote><p>"Where an arrest has been made on premises occupied or controlled by the arrested person.".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0257">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 101, in page 12, line 3, leave out 'and' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"and (iii) of the result.".</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 249, in page 12, line 4, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>"(7) The person whose premises have been searched under subsection (I) above may obtain a copy of the record of the authorisation for the search if he asks for it within three months of the search".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In considering this group of amendments, I should like to discuss amendments Nos. 248 and 249. I do not believe that it is appropriate to discuss amendment No. 101. I do not know the intentions of the hon. Member for Thornaby (Mr. Wrigglesworth) who tabled that amendment, and I see that neither he nor the hon. Member for Croydon, North-West (Mr. Pitt) is here. 1 can conclude only that there is disinterest on the part of the Alliance in this Bill.<br><br>
Amendment No. 248 refers to an issue that has been partly covered by our discussion of amendment No. 156, although the point is slightly different to that raised in earlier amendments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 248 refers to the particular circumstances described in subsection (4) that enable the police to make a search without authorisation when a person has been arrested and before he is taken to the police station. The amendment seeks to limit those powers to circumstances
<br><blockquote><p>"where an arrest has been made on premises occupied or controlled by the arrested person"</p></blockquote>
but not when the arrest has been made miles from those premises. That would be an additional safeguard on the way that the police could use those powers.<br><br>
Amendment No. 249 seeks to enable that person whose premises will be searched under subsection (1) to be given a copy of the record of the authorisation by the police officer for the search if he asks for it within three months of the search. That would give the person whose premises were searched additional information about the purpose of the search and it may be helpful to him if the case went to trial. It may also be helpful to him even if no further proceedings took place. I hope that the Minister will consider that reasonable safeguard sympathetically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hon. Members may notice certain misprints in the amendment paper. It was not printed by the Stationery Office and I trust hon. Members will ignore any misprints.</span></p>
<p>10.50–55 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lewisham, West)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs). If the Minister of State and his functionaries have sorted themselves out, I shall put forward what I believe to be the nub of all the amendments to clause 11.<br><br>
In previous clauses we have tried to make sure that searches are properly authorised by a senior police officer and, if necessary, by a circuit or High Court judge. We have tried to protect the invasions of privacy of homes which the Minister of State must accept have
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
gone on in a gross and dreadful way in the London area in the past few years.<br><br>
Here we come to a clause that is typical of each Bill that the Government bring forward. It says, "Let us have a safeguard over searches, but let there be an exception so that we do not need safeguards in certain cases." The Government always say that there may be an emergency, and I suppose that my hon. Friend the Minister for Battersea, South has said that there may be cases of emergency and that the police must search; there must be some provision to allow a constable to get on with the job without going through the safeguards that we have talked about. Some of us accept that that is necessary, but the power still needs stringent post facto safeguards to make sure that some of the horrific things that have been going on in London do not continue.<br><br>
Perhaps I could just remind the Minister of State and the Committee of the sort of thing that goes on day after day in the Metropolitan police area. I have a letter from a parent in London W2. I do not wish to give any more details than that, but W2 is an area not very far from the House of Commons.<br><br>
She says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I arrived home on the 26th after having spent a weekend with friends and what I saw filled me with total horror. It was as if a destruction company had done their best to demolish my home. 1 could not get a word out of my 12 year old son, he dinged to me in terror and could not stop crying, he was almost hysterical.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I managed to calm him down and was told the following story of what had occurred. On the 24th July at about 9 o'clock in the morning my 12 year old son was awoken with a gun pointed at his head. Our dog must have sensed the danger and got the man's arm and my son took the gun and pointed it at the man. When my son called the dog off the man, he managed to tell my son that he was a police officer, and that he had a warrant for his older brother.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>How was my son to know this was the truth? He is fully aware of the fact that people break in and kill for no reason. He could have pulled that trigger and killed the person in question.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>This has done serious damage to my son. He keeps waking up at night and has nightmare after nightmare and has begun to walk about in his sleep. When asked what is wrong, he keeps saying 'There is a man in there trying to kill us', or he is seeing things in the mirror."</p></blockquote>
She goes on to describe the search that went on after that.
<br><blockquote><p>"The warrant was for my son's arrest. Why did they search my bedroom, and the rest of my home? Why did they leave my home in total destruction? It took me three days to put it back into reasonable order. I took pictures of the way they left my home. Furthermore, they confiscated all my diaries, business and private correspondence, pawn tickets and valuations of my jewellery, all my private photographs, holiday snaps, etc. which was in a beauty bag and ornaments which had nothing to do with my son.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>My son has his own room and all his belongings are confined to his room, so why did they go through my belongings, and confiscate my private things? The warrant for an arrest was not for me, or a search warrant for my home. They also came to my son's business."</p></blockquote>
She goes on about a further search that took place there.<br><br>
The great danger of the clause is that the police may arrest someone in a house where many people live. Somebody may live there who ought properly to be arrested, and the police should have the right to search his part of the house.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
10.55–11 am<br><br>
The clause needs more stingent safeguards than at present. There has been instance after instance in London of the police not simply going for the arrest of an individual but often disrupting the life of the extended family, embracing individuals who are completely innocent. On so many occasions in the houses of the West Indian or other minority communities every member of the family is turned against the police for the rest of his life.<br><br>
I beg the Minister of State to realise that this situation exists. The clause needs far greater safeguards than it has already.<br><br>
This series of amendments has two minor safeguards. One is that searches should be carried out only when the arrest takes places on the premises and the search can be witnessed by the individual arrested. Many people who know about the situation know that that is not the case at the moment. The police confine the arrested person to one part of the house while they go through the rest of the house. Sometimes, but not always, they leave the sort of trail of destruction that one might expect when one's house had been burgled.<br><br>
The other safeguard is that the aggrieved person should, after the event, have an account of the authorisation for the search. I know what the Minister is probably going to say, although I hope that he does not. He will probably say that any aggrieved person has the right under civil law to sue the police and to obtain justice. However, he knows that the experience of trying to do that in London is such that most legal advisers advise their clients that, unless all the individuals in the house turn out to be totally innocent and the actions of the police were so gross that it is totally obvious, there is not a hope in hell of getting any money whatever by civil litigation. The Minister must know that.<br><br>
There was a recent case in which Mr. Justice Mars-Jones drew himself up to his full height and awarded exemplary damages against the Metropolitan police. I was very glad that he did so. I have said some rough things about that judge in the past because he took the ABC case. However, one needs judges who are willing to stand up and award such damages. I know the situation from solicitors in my constituency. People come to me, and. I might say, "Find a solicitor and ask him what sort of a case you have." They then come back to me and say that the solicitor has told them that they would probably not get legal aid and if they did they would not get anywhere with the case.<br><br>
If the Minister of State believes all that he has said about wanting to protect the privacy of the individual and that the Englishman's home, however humble and whatever colour that Englishman may be, should be his castle, clause 11—it is the exception clause because the safeguards do not have to be followed in an emergency—must have far stronger safeguards.<br><br>
If we simply write these words into the Act, they will be the justification in civil litigation for the police to defend themselves. They will say, "We may search if it is an arrestable offence. If a police officer is present he may act quickly if he believes that it is necessary." I cannot see how, as the clause stands—the Minister appreciates that I am no lawyer; I know nothing about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 452</span>
the law—a case could be brought against a policeman if he left the trail of destruction that I described.</span></p>
<p>11.00–05 am</p>
<p>11 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Sir Nicholas Bonsor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As subsection (2) stands—it will be better when my hon. and learned Friend amends it, as he has undertaken to do—the horrific search that the hon. Gentleman told us about could not possibly be said by the police to be reasonably required in the circumstances. I do not accept that the clause fails to provide a remedy for that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I completely agree that it could not be reasonably required. But can we be certain that the courts in London—the police have highly-paid QCs to defend them, whom they can hire with their bottomless pit of money, while the aggrieved citizen probably will not be able to afford such people—will come to the same conclusion? On the face of the Bill, it would seem easy to mount a case against the police about what is "reasonably required" in those circumstances. But in my experience of what really happens, the police will say, for example, that they are looking for something that has been hidden by a drug pusher.<br><br>
Let us consider the taking away of diaries, for instance. Perhaps someone is suspected of dealing in heroin; the police might note all the telephone numbers —possibly even that of his mother. I am sure that the police could get away with it in an average English court. Occasionally a judge would steer things in favour of the aggrieved person, but normally the opposite would happen—or, at least, he would do little to help that person. It would be a fight between him and the police, who feel that juries want to support them. I have no confidence that somebody who suffered the sort of search that I described—I have a sheaf of similar cases; it is not an isolated incident—would win the case. Something must be done.<br><br>
I have supported what has already been done, because it involves judges and magistrates. As a politician, I can make speeches and perhaps put a little pressure on the Magistrates' Association. But if the Bill is passed everything will go wrong and such searches will be even more likely. If we simply leave the authorisation in the hands of any old policeman there will be nothing that Members of Parliament or anybody else can do, especially in the light of the fact that we do not have an independent prosecuting system and that the Government will not concede democratic control of the police, which for the Metropolitan police will continue in the same shape and with the same lack of accountability as at present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) will not expect me to comment on the circumstances which he described; he understands the reason for that. But I entirely agree with his general point, founded on that illustration, that if powers of search are exercised in a way that is plainly beyond what is necessary, and in a way that suggests vindictiveness or destruction for destruction's sake, which is harmful, damaging and wrong.<br><br>

11.05–10 am<br><br>
Apart from other considerations affecting the interests of ordinary individuals, such as the hon. Gentleman's correspondent, such activity on the part of the police is very harmful to the police themselves. I know that to be the understanding of the commissioner and all senior officers in the Metropolitan police. We all recognise that the police can only function effectively if they have the support and consent of the population. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that one can visualise that, where power is abused, all who come into contact with that abuse may be turned against the police thereafter. That is common ground.<br><br>
It is not possible to legislate to confer power upon the police, or, indeed, upon anybody else, in such a way as to guarantee that that power will never be abused. We can, of course, look for sanctions and endeavour to make them as effective as is practicable. Sanctions and safeguards cannot be made so effective that they nullify the purpose of the power which it is thought right to confer. However, one must do one's best.<br><br>
There are two sanctions or safeguards against that which the hon. Gentleman described. One is the disciplinary structure or rules of the police force concerned. Last week my right hon. Friend placed in the Library a summary of the commissioner's interim report on his approach to policing in the metropolis. It contained—I speak from memory—a statement to the effect that the commissioner attached the highest importance to police officer's standards of behaviour and courtesy. One of the reasons why the commissioner holds so strongly to that view is the reason to which I have already referred this morning. I believe that the disciplinary code of the Metropolitan police will be used to deal with such cases of abuse.<br><br>
The other sanction or safeguard is the power to claim damages and exemplary damages in the civil court. I was glad that the hon. Gentleman referred to the case of Mr. White and Mr. Justice Mars-Jones's award, because it showed that the power to award exemplary damages is not a dead letter. Until that judgment, there were some who thought that it was. The power to award exemplary damages is rarely exercised, and the judgment served as an exemplary warning that substantial sanctions are available to discourage abuse of power, and action in excess of power, that confers the right to invade privacy.<br><br>
I ask myself how much further one can go. One can go down the exclusionary road, which a later amendment seeks to do. I would not wish to anticipate in any detail arguments appropriate to that amendment.<br><br>
I do not think that it can be right to deal with an injustice such as the hon. Gentleman has described by one of a different kind. I do not believe that the overall interests of justice are served by enacting that evidence which is substantially relevant to a serious crime and which is discovered in the course of a search that is considered wrong because it is unnecessarily destructive or extensive may not be used, however vital it may be to the investigation of a serious crime and to bringing a dangerous criminal to justice.<br><br>
11.10–15 am<br><br>
If we do not adopt the exclusionary road, I do not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
know a practical way to extend the two safeguards or sanctions that I have described. It is important to remember that the clause sets out for the first time a statutory code of the powers of search and entry and the relevant rights and obligations. The code largely follows the recommendations of the Royal Commission, which considered these matters at length. It is a great advance in the protection that should properly be given to individuals. Equally, for the first time police officers are given a clear statement of what they may and may not do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the Minister agree that there is a third group of safeguards which might be subsumed under the word "openness"? Amendment No. 249 refers to that factor. I have not tabled an amendment, because such a provision might be better included in a new clause embracing many powers in relation to the publication of statistics. One safeguard would be that each police force should detail each year, although not with identification, the number of searches and whether they proved abortive.<br><br>
If I put down a new clause going towards that degree of openness, could the hon. and learned Gentleman give some indication of the width of his smile, so to speak ?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that amendment No. 249 does bear upon the consideration of openness, to which we both attach importance. I am glad to be able to tell the hon. Gentleman that I can advise the Committee to accept that amendment in principle, although the existing words will not quite do. It provides a small measure of reassurance and it does not interfere with the effectiveness of the powers that the clause gives to the police.<br><br>
The amendment refers to the authorisation for a search, but subsection (4) permits searches to be made without any power or authorisation. The simplest way of meeting the point of the amendment would be to amend subsection (3) to make it clear that any record should be put on the custody record. If that will not help where the arrested person and the householder are not the same, we may be able to overcome that objection by introducing a further subsection on the lines of the existing amendment. I am prepared to do that, and I believe that it will be helpful.<br><br>
I cannot give a commitment about the hon. Gentleman's proposal, but he will know that, in an earlier part of the Bill, we provided that information about the use of powers of search shall feature in the annual reports of chief constables. The information will, therefore, be open to scrutiny by police authorities and Her Majesty's inspectors. I shall consider whether the hon. Gentleman's suggestion is on all fours with that provision. There is no desire to be secretive about the use of the powers that we are confirming in the Bill.<br><br>
May I just say, for the sake of a completeness, that our objection to amendment No. 248 is substantial. The amendment seeks to put in front of subsection (4).
<br><blockquote><p>"Where an arrest has been made on premises occupied or controlled by the arrested person".</p></blockquote>
In other words the power conferred by subsection (4) shall be exercised only in those circumstances. But the power is not limited to cases where somebody has been arrested on premises occupied or controlled by him.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
11.15–20 am<br><br>
One can visualise, in circumstances where someone is arrested just outside his home on suspicion of stealing goods, that a member of his family would then conceal, or dispose of in some way, stolen property that was on the premises. That is why it would not be practicable or sensible to confine the power in subsection (4) as closely as amendment No. 248 would do.<br><br>
11.15 am<br><br>
Therefore, I cannot advise the Committee to accept that amendment, but I am glad to accept in principle the intention of amendment No. 249.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of what the Minister has said, particularly about amendment No. 249 but also about amendment No. 248, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the absence of the hon. Member for Thornaby (Mr. Wrigglesworth), while I should not venture to probe the mind of a member of the SDP, I wish to speak to the group of amendments because they intrigue me. I understand that they intend to make the safeguards set out in clause 12 apply to production orders as well as to search warrants.<br><br>
If there is an ambiguity and the safeguards do not apply to production orders, will the Minister say so and rectify the matter? I believe that the safeguards apply and that the amendment is unnecessary but, as the Minister has had longer to appreciate their purport, he may be able to clarify the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Thornaby (Mr. Wrigglesworth) is doing good not by stealth but by default. There is just enough uncertainty in the wording of the clause as drafted to warrant an acceptance of the principle, although not of the precise wording, of the amendment.<br><br>
The intention behind the amendment, to which the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) has spoken in the absence of its author, is that orders and warrants applied for and issued under clause 10 should attract all the relevant safeguard
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
contained in clause 12 as well as the additional safeguards contained in clause 10.<br><br>
If there is doubt, and I believe that there is some doubt, it is inadvertent. I cannot advise the Committee to accept all the amendments as they stand. It is not, for example, appropriate for clause 10 production orders to have to specify the premises to be searched, because such an order does not involve a search and confers no power of search.<br><br>
I undertake, however, to look again at the drafting to ensure that whenever a clause 12 safeguard is relevant it shall apply to clause 10. I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Accrington for taking the opportunity that was rejected by the hon. Member for Thornaby.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the possible lacuna and saying that he will look at the matter further. In those circumstances, if I may take it upon myself, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 250, in Clause 12, page 12, line 5, after 'warrant', insert
<br><blockquote><p>"under this or any other enactment or under any rule of common law".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 251, in page 12, line 11, after 'enactment', insert 'or rule of law'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's comments and the similarity to earlier amendments of the proposals in amendments No. 250 and 251, I hope that he will be able to make the same sort of conciliatory gesture as he did on earlier amendments which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) moved so persuasively.<br><br>
Amendment No. 250 would ensure that the safeguards in clause 12 regarding conditions under which search warrants may be applied for and used will apply to other search warrants not covered by clause 12. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister nods his head, which makes me feel that I need go no further than to allow him to confirm that he is sympathetic in principle to the points covered by both amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to amend where there is doubt or uncertainty about the effect of the wording.<br><br>
I confirm that it is clearly established that the safeguards in clause 12 apply to all search warrants and not only to those which may be applied for and issued under clauses 9 and 10. Therefore the amendment is not needed. It would only add unnecessary words. I am told that there is no doubt about that. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not feel it necessary to press his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's complete assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 252, in page 12, line 13, leave out 'so far as possible'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 253, in page 12, line 26, leave out "so far as possible".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The clause is headed "Search warrants —safeguards" and to a certain extent the safeguards seem to be fairly satisfactory. But the loophole is the use of the phrase "so far as possible" in each amendment. What does that mean ?<br><br>
For some time, there have been judges rules and there is the right of a suspect who is held at a police station to see a solicitor. We have seen an amazing variation in the ways in which that right has been exercised. Thst is one of the reasons for the Royal Commission's being asked to go into this issue. Rules that should have been followed, which one might have expected to be breached once in a 12-month period, if at all, steadily became breached more often. Eventually, we almost felt that it was the exception rather than the rule when an individual was allowed his rights and given access to a solicitor. That has been a problem.<br><br>
The Minister may say—I would see his point—that it is important that there should be some provision for the exception. But the phrase "so far as possible" does not seem to define how infrequently the Minister will expect the exception to be the case. The Minister ought to have put in the clause provision for a special and much more difficult procedure to cover the exception. In other words, if there is an exception, the person involved must go through some extra procedure and extra justification of why it is not necessary to invoke the safeguards.<br><br>
Simply to include the phrase "so far as possible" leaves a loophole which would encourage the police officer who is hard pressed—I do not blame the police, because in many circumstances they are hard pressed, need to get on with their jobs and do not wish to become involved in bureaucracy—to say, "In this instance, it was not really possible." Once that has happened it will happen in another case and yet another and gradually it will become the rule rather than the rare exception.<br><br>
11.25–11.30<br><br>
I ask the Minister whether, if he feels that there must be an exception—there may well be a case for one— there should be a special procedure for the police to follow to justify why an exception should have been made rather than simply leaving it for them to say, "We did it because the legislation says 'so far as possible' and we did not feel that it was possible." That will be very difficult to challenge and may involve a highly technical challenge in the civil courts, which is totally unsatisfactory.<br><br>
I await the Minister's reply with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We seem to be making good progress but it is the duty of the Opposition to draw attention to each coach and horses loophole that the Government appear to have provided in the Bill.<br><br>
I keep emphasising that I am a layman who knows nothing of the law, but it seems to me that the use of the words "so far as possible" in relation to the issuing
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
of warrants will enable the police to state a specific reason in their application for a warrant and then to add "and any other stolen goods" or similar phrases. I may be quite wrong and the Minister may tell me that I am, but if we are to legislate to the extent of being specific about what shall be contained in the warrant, that is what we should do. If we allow the words "so far as possible" to remain, we might as well not bother to legislate, because they will simply allow the police to use a formula phrase such as "any other stolen goods" and enable them to look for anything that they wish.<br><br>
I wish to quote from another of the large dossier of cases that have been provided to Opposition Members. This case did not occur in London W2 but in Upton in London E7, but it is as typical as any other. It is the case of the owner of an electrical shop who had been harassed by the police for a long period, in the sense of having been searched every day. On one occasion the police took away a radio cassette which had not been stolen but belonged to the owner.<br><br>
The account relates an example of what goes on at present, and if the words "so far as possible" remain in the legislation such events could continue in future. I shall read just a couple of paragraphs from the account which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"When we all came downstairs again my front door was wide open and another lot of policemen were coming into the house."</p></blockquote>
—this relates to the second search the police had made—
<br><blockquote><p>"They started searching the house all over again. This lot of policemen just ignored me as if I was not there. Most of my Xmas decorations were broken because of the way they handled the plastic bags in which I had carefully put them and two of my ornaments were broken as well. When I told them about this they just laughed.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"Then, as I went to the front door to see if I could see this boy"</p></blockquote>
—the police said that they had seen a boy running away—
<br><blockquote><p>"my son-in-law had said he saw the police taking out, I saw no boy, but I did see a policeman going through the front gate with my radio cassette. I ran after him and another policeman made as if to trip me up. But I reached the policeman with my radio cassette and grabbed hold of it (both of us were holding on to it then). I said how dare you take my property. He said we are the law and we do what we like. And after that he said that he was taking it to the police station. When I asked him for a receipt, he said 'don't be so' "</p></blockquote>
—there follows an obscenity which Mr. Speaker has ruled must not be read out in a Committee—
<br><blockquote><p>' 'stupid, what do you take us for'. Then he went into the car with my radio cassette and then all the other policemen left too."</p></blockquote>
11.30–35 am<br><br>
Two pages later—there is page after page of it—she describes how she tried to get back her radio cassette. The account continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"At that time I was also concerned about the radio cassette the police had taken from my house. It was my property and I wanted it back. I went to the police station on two occasions and asked for it back, or a receipt for it. I was told that I could not have either. After my first court appearance, my barrister asked … why the police were holding the radio cassette."</p></blockquote>
The policeman
<br><blockquote><p>"admitted that it was not stolen, that it formed no part of any charge and that the police had been wrong to take it in the first
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0262">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
place from my house. He also said that if I went to the police station I could have it back. I went to the police station three times the next day, Wednesday, and each time I was told that"—</p></blockquote>
the policeman in question—
<br><blockquote><p>"was not there and that I could not have the radio cassette back. I phoned the police station later in the evening and spoke to"—</p></blockquote>
someone—
<br><blockquote><p>"who said that if I came to the police station the next day, Thursday, I could have it back."</p></blockquote>
Subsequently, the lady got it back.<br><br>
11.30 am<br><br>
That is another Archers-type story—a typical story of everyday London folk!—of the sort of thing that goes on.<br><br>
A safeguard in clause 12 that I am pleased about is that if the police search a house for something they will not be allowed to go on fishing expeditions. An officer will not be able to say to himself, "That's a nice-looking radio cassette; I think I'll have it; I believe it to be stolen goods", and give it back months later after admitting that it had not been stolen. But unless we remove the phase "so far as possible" and make the police write down in black and white what they are looking for, there is little chance of preventing what is going on day after day in London—which I admit the commissioner detests.<br><br>
All the London Labour Members went to see the commissioner recently, and he told us how much he wanted to stop that sort of behaviour; we had a very free and frank discussion. However, that is not the point. Sir Robert Mark and subsequent commissioners have all detested such behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Is the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) sure that he is not trying to make a clause stand part speech ?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not making a clause stand part speech, Mr. English, but discussing the words "so far as possible".<br><br>
The commissioner does not want his policemen to go on fishing expeditions in private houses. He knows that that probably alienates the people of London from the police more than anything else. Officers, often of a fairly low rank—usually constables—go on those expeditions. They enter houses to search for something but frequently remove something else.<br><br>
We hoped that the application for a warrant procedure would ensure that the police had to write down what they wanted to look for and, if they found it, they would take it away. If not, that would be the end of the matter. But that is not what happens. "So far as possible" is another coach and horses phrase in the Bill that will allow the police to go on their fishing expeditions. That is why I want the words removed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Snape <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Bromwich, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to draw the attention of my hon. Friend to paragraph 3.48 of the Royal Commission report, which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It defies common sense to expect the police not to seize such items"—</p></blockquote>
those which are not, as he correctly remarked, mentioned in the warrant—
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"incidentally found during the course of a search. At the same time the risk that premises may be ransacked as soon as a warrant is granted in respect of any offence must be minimised".</p></blockquote>
Does my hon. Friend agree that those two sentences appear to be contradictory? Without the safeguards that he so ably outlined the events about which the Royal Commission gave warning are likely to happen.</span></p>
<p>11.35–40 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I refer to paragraph 3.48 of the report of the Royal Commission headed:
<br><blockquote><p>"Restrictions upon seizure for evidential and other purposes".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend drew attention to a characteristic of the Royal Commission's report which has amazing similarities to the Franks report. It says one thing, then the opposite and pats itself on the back and says how clever it is. That is not the only instance when the report says the police should not do something that would bring them into disrepute but on the other hand they must be allowed to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the opposite of what is said.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall read it again. Paragraph 3.48 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"We do not think it desirable to limit seizure only to prohibited goods or to the evidence specified in the warrant."</p></blockquote>
I take it that that is why "so far as possible" has been written into the Bill. It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"It defies common sense to expect the police not to seize such items incidentally found during the course of the search."</p></blockquote>
I do not believe that it defies common sense at all. That is what Parliament ought to expect. However that is what the great Royal Commission said although I do not believe that it is right.<br><br>
It went on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"At the same time the risk that premises may be ransacked as soon as a warrant is granted in respect of any offence must be minimised."</p></blockquote>
I agree that it must be minimised, but to write into the clause "so far as possible" does not do that. It opens the flood gates to the sort of ransacking, an example of which I gave that happened recently in Upton, London E7. I beg the Minister, when he has read his little Home Office brief saying that he cannot accept the amendment, to be sympathetic.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It just says "oppose".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It just says, "Oppose and use your common sense, because we are sick of writing these briefs for you."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is tempting providence. I dealt with the last amendment in his favour without reading a word of what was prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman will be in trouble.<br><br>
I beg the Minister to accept our desire to delete the words "so far as possible" from the Bill. Someone who wishes to protest either by bringing a civil case or by a complaint against the police should have some proper grounds to do so. They should not be able to parrot out, "Well, it says as far as possible and that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0263">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
means we can nick anything we like if we have reasonable suspicion that it is the sort of thing we want to take away." That will negative everything that we are trying to do with regard to putting the police under rules when they invade the privacy of Englishmen's homes—Englishmen's castles—whether those are in W2 or E7.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) always discusses lawyers and claims to know nothing about the law but has turned out to be the best lawyer and barrister in the place. His point is clearly a valid one. He continues to read from the book in front of him which looks like Grimms fairy tales. The tales are real and anything but fairy, but they are very grim.<br><br>
We could all tell stories about police abuse of the power of entry when they have seized goods that they had no intention of claiming but seized them in order to make enquiries about whether they were stolen. I have come across so many cases of that sort. I shall cite the only one that comes to mind that is not specifically on the point, but it raises a similar issue.<br><br>
11.40–45 am<br><br>
I once sat at Inner London and a case came before me that concerned a black youth who had a flat in a block. There had been a complaint to the police about a burglary in another flat. The police arrived and went to the surrounding flats to ask whether anyone had seen anything suspicious. They knocked on the door of the youth's flat and in the course of asking whether he had seen anything they went into the flat.<br><br>
They then saw various instruments attached to the telephone, such as machines for answering and for making calls automatically. According to the police officer, those machines were available only from the Post Office on hire and he did not think that the unemployed West Indian youth would have the money to make hiring agreements. The police officer seized the machines and arrested the youth for theft or handling stolen goods.<br><br>
At the trial someone from the Post Office was called to indicate that the machines had a Post Office mark on them and were therefore Post Office property and to declare that the Post Office never sold them but only rented them and had not rented them to that youth. When the expert was called he found it difficult to find the marks and an adjournment had to be called so that he could look more closely.<br><br>
I indicated to the prosecution that it might be difficult for an innocent youth to have seen a Post Office mark and recognised it as such if the expert could not do that. The police insisted on continuing the prosecution on the basis that the machines could be obtained only by hiring. The expert went on to say that they were occasionally sold to junk shops and that they might have been bought there. The case then collapsed of course.<br><br>
Meanwhile, the youth had been in prison facing trial for several months. That had been so only because the policeman had acted in total violation of his powers and without reasonable suspicion. It was not for me, as I was sitting on the bench, to advise the accused to sue the police. However, there seemed to be an overwhelming
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
case for doing so. That sort of thing happens regularly as anyone who has been involved in a criminal practice knows.<br><br>
In the Bill we are giving the police much wider powers. Those powers are bound to be abused if the same cavalier attitude is taken about the wider powers as it was about the narrower powers. One of the arguments of the Royal Commission and the police has always been that the police act cavalierly because their powers are so restricted and that when they have wider legitimate powers they will not need to act cavalierly. I suspect that it will be somewhat different and that the elastic will be pulled even further once it is recognised that there is a limitation on the new powers.<br><br>
The difficulty about words such as "as far as possible" is that they provide elasticity in the power. Once the stage is reached where the police officer can say, "It was not possible on this occasion to obey the law and therefore I didn't", he has an absolute defence, not only to any claim in court that he acted improperly but to any claim for damages in the civil court arising out of the abuse of power.<br><br>
The Minister should look more carefully at the clause and at all the clauses involving powers where the qualification is put in. The qualification is put for the emergency situation so that any reasonable police officer might act in that way to forestall criminal activity.<br><br>
If we could trust all our policemen to the point that we knew that everything they did was a reasonable exercise of power we would not be arguing about this today. There would not be the heat against the Bill. It is because we know that, although many officers, perhaps the majority, act responsibly, there is a considerable number who do not. Because of that, we must be careful about the exercise of power. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the qualifying words.</span></p>
<p>11.45 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Lyell <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a common purpose in the Committee to see that the nature of the articles is properly specified, with all reasonable detail. The removal of the words "so far as possible" would weaken the provision, although I appreciate that Opposition Members take a different view.<br><br>
The words "so far as possible" would be construed by a court as meaning exactly what they say. The policeman would have to specify the nature of the articles as far as it was possible for him to do objectively at the time. I believe that the words would be construed in the same way as the words frequently used in legal documents, "to use best endeavours".<br><br>
Many people believe that a contract requiring somebody to use his best endeavours is weaker than a contract that simply requires someone to do something. But they do not realise that a best endeavours clause and, in my submission, a "so far as possible" clause, are very stringent provisions. If an officer gave some lame excuse that it was not possible at the time, after he had given a wholly inadequate specification of the articles, no court would consider that to be satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman accept that part of our argument is that that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0264">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
will not be tested in court ? If the information obtained from a search was not admissible evidence, there would some sanction. But the only sanction is to start civil proceedings, and that is a very weak sanction. It is rather unreasonable to expect an individual to have to take that sort of action. Although the court might use the test, we are really talking about how the police will interpret it in most cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two points to be made in reply to the hon. Gentleman. First, we are concerned with how the magistrate—not the police officer—will view it. If those words are left out, a policeman may state as the grounds on which he makes the application that he believes that an offence has been committed. He would state the Act under which the warrant would be issued, and specify the nature of the articles which were sought as articles that might have been used in furtherance of the crime. That would be a specification of the nature of the articles. But it would not be a specification "so far as possible".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the hon. and learned Gentleman started his useful and helpful legal exposition, he said that he thought that "so far as possible" meant "in all reasonable detail". The words "in all reasonable detail" would be a super phrase to put in. If we could consider an amendment to specify articles "in all reasonable detail", although I am an ignorant layman, so to speak, I believe that that would be a far greater safeguard than "so far as possible". The hon. and learned Gentleman is the lawyer, but it seems better to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it seems better to the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that the courts would construe "so far as possible" in the fairly commonsense, lay manner that I have described. They would not construe the phrase as a complete let-out to a police officer, as the hon. Gentleman fears.<br><br>
That is about as much of a contribution as I can make on this matter, but it is my clear opinion that the words would be viewed in that way. It would be unwise to use them in seeking the common purpose which the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price), the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) and I have in removing the clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the argument with interest. I must beware of entering what my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) described the other day as an archaic argument between the lawyers.<br><br>
11.50–55 am<br><br>
I do not understand how the hon. and learned Gentleman can be so sure that when he has described is the way in which the courts would interpret the omission of the words "so far as possible". With the words that are left, and officer has to specify the nature of the articles sought, but if he says that he cannot do so the enactment would fall and he would have no right to enter. Therefore, if an officer did not exactly specify the nature of the articles sought, there would not be a proper use of the warrant. It would not, as the hon. Gentleman suggests, at all be like the civil provision.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman. Most articles can have a number of natures, and one could be that they are articles which might have been used in furtherance of the crime in question. That would be unhelpful, but it would specify one of the natures, and part of the broad nature, of the articles. I believe that the addition of the words "so far as possible" means that, where it is possible, there is an obligation on an officer to be more specific. That is usually possible in the pursuit of crimes. Therefore, it would be wiser to leave the words in than to remove them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely, if the hon. and learned Gentleman's interpretation is right, the words "so far as possible" should be substituted by a phrase such as "with as much detail as possible". My argument is that if "so far as possible" means what I suspect that it means, an officer who says that he cannot specify the nature of the articles will not legally have to do so. The hon. and learned Gentleman's argument is that the words mean that is an officer has some idea of the nature of the articles sought he must say so, with as much detail as possible. That would be a positive, rather than a negative, benefit. However, I suspect that the courts will use my interpretation of the words rather than the hon. and learned Gentleman's.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the hon. Gentleman's interpretation. The use of the words "with as much detail as possible", which he suggested, really add nothing to the words "so far as possible". It is not only a policeman's subjective judgment that is being considered but the objective consideration of a justice of the peace.<br><br>
A justice of the peace has a duty under the Bill to satisfy himself or herself that the application for a warrant is in order. If a blatantly inadequate description of the nature of the articles sought is given, it is the duty of the JP to point that out and to ask for a better explanation before the warrant is issued. I appreciate that hon. Members may think that that duty will not always be fulfilled. However, that is a different matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is the case being put forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No. That is not the same matter. The Committee is dealing with detailed clauses of the Bill and with specific words. The fact that hon. Members may think that a duty may be glossed over is not a reason for arguing that words should be different, if they have a proper meaning.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me. I did not mean to crush him, and if I put my hand firmly on the lid of the box which contains the hon. Gentleman's spring it would have been wiser to have taken my hand away and left the catch upon him. However, if he wishes to rise, I will give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, like the genie, I can rise from a bottle and both sides of the Committee will be happy.<br><br>
I am at a loss to understand down which road the hon. and learned Gentleman is taking the Committee. He advanced the view that it will be for a justice of the peace to cross-examine an officer seeking a warrant. Can he tell the Committee in how many cases of which he is aware in his legal career—I appreciate his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0265">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
expertise in these matters—such a cross-examination has taken place and also in how many cases the application has been refused ?</span></p>
<p>11.55–12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>My Lyell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not a particularly regular practitioner in the magistrates' courts at present, so my experience is fairly limited. On the other hand, I have sat for a good many hours at Bow Street. In my experience, these matters have always been sensibly considered in the magistrates' courts, usually by stipendiary magistrates. The grounds given are usually reasonable, too.<br><br>
To return briefly to the point in question, it is clearly a matter of legal interpretation and to some extent a matter of opinion and practice. I have stated my sincere view that the words "as far as possible" will not be regarded as a let-out, except where a sensible, objective person—a justice of the peace—can see good reason for a let-out, which there will sometimes be. I believe that it would be wiser to leave the words in than to remove them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to everyone in the Committee who has spoken on this issue. We want to be satisfied about what it is right to try to achieve and, that the language that we use, achieves it.<br><br>
I agree that we should phrase the clause so that we do not encourage unnecessarily wide search and so the language must be as specific as possible to make it clear that the power is sought for as specific a purpose as possible, and that the power granted by the magistrate— an important point made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. Lyell)—is granted in as specific terms as possible.<br><br>
The Royal Commission said in paragraph 3.47:
<br><blockquote><p>"Warrants should specify the object or objects of the search, and the premises to be searched, in as precise detail as possible."</p></blockquote>
That is the Government's purpose. I fully agree with my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead that if the words are knocked out and the clause is left without them, we shall be left with a not more, but less specific description of the nature of the article or whatever.<br><br>
I agree that we need to have either these words or other words that convey the meaning that we desire. None of us want to allow a magistrate to give a search warrant in terms wider than is needed and wider than could practicably be given.<br><br>
For example, if someone knows that he has been attacked with a knife, there is no reason for an officer to ask for a search warrant that does not specify "a knife". On the other hand, if the victim knows only that he has been hit with a heavy instrument, it would be quite wrong to require the nature of the instrument sought to be specified in the warrant save by the words "some large instrument".<br><br>
I agree that we are saying that police officers shall specify, to such extent as is reasonably practicable, what they want the search warrant for. We want the warrant that the magistrate issues to be as specific as that. I shall look to see whether there is another way of doing this, perhaps by use of the formula "reasonably practicable" which we are well used to in civil legislation, such as the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
factories Acts. The word "possibility" is slightly difficult to use in legislation. Perhaps the Committee will allow me to look at the matter again, without any commitment to change the wording, because we may be satisfied at the end of the day that it should stay as it is. That seems to be the most convenient way to proceed.</span></p>
<p>12 noon-12.05 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) makes his concluding speech, I should like to thank the Minister for his helpful, un-Home Office-like response to the matter. When he thinks about another possible forms of words, will he take account of another sort of case that has been brought to my attention ?<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
A recent case in London, which I shall not quote, involved police obtaining a warrant on a minor matter and then seizing from a safe all the evidence that had been prepared for the defence by another person. The case has not yet been completely disposed of, but it seems from my information that the police officer passed all the evidence to another policeman so that the prosecution in a coming case would have notice of the prepared defence, which included tape recordings and a great mass of material.<br><br>
I wonder whether it would be possible to use a form of words which included the phrase "reasonably practicable", or whatever other adjective one might use with "reasonably", which would make it clear that the articles to be sought must be relevant to a specific crime, and not to another matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note what the hon. Gentleman says, but it is rather off the point. It is dealt with in clause<br><br>
11(1). Of course this is not a power to search at large for anything that may come in useful. Subsection (1) sets out the limits of the power.<br><br>
I by no means want it to be assumed that because I have replied briefly to the debate, I accept everything that has been said, especially in relation to the practices of the Metropolitan police—a matter raised by the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) and others.<br><br>
What I have said is that excessive use of power, whether it is used too widely, too destructively, or whatever—is bad. It is bad for the population and for the police, and all sensible police officers know that. I say nothing as to the extent to which it may occur. All I know is that it is disapproved of strongly by all sensible police officers and by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.<br><br>
The hon. Member for York (Mr. Lyon) said that if we could trust all police officers, we would not need such powers. If we could trust all our fellow citizens we would not need powers for police officers to undertake a great many disagreeable duties on our behalf. Therefore, it is six of one and half a dozen of another. We must ensure that the powers that we confer upon police officers are what they reasonably need, and that they do not go beyond what it is necessary to confer for the protection of the public. That is the sole purpose of the powers.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's earlier undertaking to look at this again without guaranteeing to bring back another form of wording, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>12.05–10 pm</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not appropriate for me to initiate the clause stand part debate. But there are a couple of points that I should like to draw to the Minister's attention.<br><br>
A worry has emerged, which was expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) and is felt by many, about the way that some police officers—it is almost entirely, I believe, limited to those in the Metropolitan police—carry out searches. Allied to that is a similar, soundly-based fear that there is no adequate method of ensuring an appropriate remedy for someone whose premises have been abused in such a way.<br><br>
A great deal of praise has rightly been heaped on Mr. Justice Mars-Jones for his award of exemplary damages for what was a blatant and horrific incident. In view of the concern about the inadequacy of civil remedy and the difficulty of obtaining damages in an action, I should like to ask the Minister of State whether he can publish figures to show the number of actions that have been started in respect of damages for wrongful use of the power of search, and how many have been successful.<br><br>
I accept that such figures can be misleading. It could be that some actions have little basis of fact. None the less, it would help the Committee to draw conclusions about whether adequate remedies are available if we were given figures to go on. It would also be useful if the Minister could go into greater detail and tell us how many applications for legal aid were made with regard to civil damages and how many were granted.<br><br>
Most lawyers—my hon. Friend was correct to say that the issue is exceptionally difficult—would advise strongly against an action against the police in respect of the wrongful use of their search powers. They would tell their clients, "You have little chance of getting damages". It would have to be an extremely strong case —indeed, the evidence would need to be overwhelming —before there was a likelihood of success. That happened in the case heard by Mr. Justice Mars-Jones.<br><br>
I do not know whether the Minister of State can think of another similar case in which exemplary damages were awarded; I certainly cannot. However, I accept what he said—that the decision must have an effect on the way in which the police use the power. He was right to point out how widely publicised the case was, and its subsequent effect. But it does not mean that there have not been many other instances in which there has been a basis for a claim but in which, either on a lawyer's advice or because of refusal of legal aid, and so on, the matter has not be proceeded with or has not been successfully concluded.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
12.10–15 pm<br><br>
There is another point that I should like the Minister to consider. The purpose of the clause is to provide certain safeguards in respect of applications for search warrants. Does the clause make it possible to search a lawyer's office ?<br><br>
I tabled amendment No. 126, which was not called. I assume that that was for a good reason, as it may not have been drafted properly. The amendment would have added at the end of line 16 that the premises which the police wanted to enter and search
<br><blockquote><p>"shall not be the office or home of a solicitor or any other legal adviser".</p></blockquote>
As I understand it, any application in respect of confidential documents, especially those held by a solicitor or legal adviser, is covered by clause 10. If I am right in thinking that the procedure outlined here can apply to a solicitor's office there is a contradiction between the two clauses. I should be grateful if the Minister would clear up that important matter, which has caused concern to the Law Society. That, indeed, is why I tabled what I assume to be an inelegantly drafted amendment, although its purpose is clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Royal Commission thought it right that existing statutory powers of search should continue, and that common law rights should be put on a statutory basis. It drew attention to the need for safeguards, and did not deserve the criticism of the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) that it said two contradictory things. I do not believe that that is so at all.<br><br>
The Royal Commission believes that there is a need, in the public interest, for a power to search in certain circumstances. We should be realistic and recognise that, if a police officer comes across something incidental to the search, which he did not expect to find but which bears upon some other offence, it will be seized. The Royal Commission's purpose was to see that there should not be authority for random ransacking. We must all agree with that. There is no contradiction. There must be a power to search in proper circumstances, but it must be so closely drawn that there is no encouragement to ransack.<br><br>
It is not possible to legislate to guarantee that there will never be abuse of a power conferred by Parliament. We have to make sure that it is not encouraged, by making it as difficult as possible.<br><br>
The first point made by the hon. and learned Member for Accrington (Mr. Davidson) is very opposite. What sanctions will discourage ransacking, or other abuse of the power? We discussed those sanctions earlier, and I mentioned two sanctions or safeguards. There are disciplinary procedures, enforced by a police commissioner and his subordinate officers. They are quite behind the policy of discouraging abuse of power. There is also recourse to the civil courts, which have power to award exemplary damages. I said that I should be glad if a further safeguard or sanction might be suggested. None was suggested, although I was able to move towards agreement with the hon. Member for Lewisham, West on making it possible for the authority for such a search to be examined by the person to which it refers. It is not possible to go further than that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0267">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
The hon. and learned Member for Accrington, asked whether I knew in how many cases claims had been made. I do not. However, he was right to say that the exemplary damages case received wide publicity and will not be forgotten for a long time. I hope that it will never be forgotten.<br><br>
12.15–12.20 pm<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Accrington asked whether I knew in how many cases claims had been made. I do not. However, he was right to say that the exemplarary damages cases received wide publicity and will not be forgotten for a long time. I hope that it will never be forgotten.<br><br>
Secondly, the hon. and learned Gentleman asked whether lawyers' offices could be searched under the provisions of clause 12. The quick answer is, "Yes". They may be searched provided that the search does not infringe the provisions of clause 10. As we well know, clause 10 deals with whether access to confidentially-held evidence is applied for.<br><br>
At our last sitting we went at very proper length and in very proper detail into the qualifications, conditions and fetters that apply when such applications are sought. A solicitor's office is no more to be immune from search for stolen property, for example, than any other premises. Therefore, the answer to the hon. and learned Gentleman's question is, "Yes". However, the search must not be for a purpose that falls within clause 10 unless its provisions are complied with.<br><br>
12.15 pm<br><br>
We have gone in useful and helpful detail into the provisions of the clause and no member of the Committee has said that there should not be a power to enter and search. What matters is whether the package of safeguards, checks and balances that clause 12 provides is sensible and practical. I trust that in the light of the assurances and undertakings that I have given to examine one or two matters which were helpfully raised by the Opposition, for which I am grateful to them, we may now be satisfied that the clause should stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Alexander W. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was my intention to restrain myself until we had reached clauses 13 and 14 before intervening in the debate about safeguards. However, I was stung by the Minister when he said that no one had been able to produce better safeguards than those in the Bill.<br><br>
I trust that the Minister will have studied new clause 2, which I hope that the Chair will call in due course. It refers to the whole of the powers in parts I, II, III and IV and makes it mandatory for the courts to refuse to admit evidence seized in violation of those powers unless it is in the public interest to admit it. It seems to me that that is a much more cogent power than disciplinary proceedings initiated by a chief constable if any of the safeguards are violated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only to say that when I was discussing the matter earlier I referred to the possibility of such an exclusionary rule and said that I felt that that was not right. I did not understand any hon. Member
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
to take a contrary view at that time. However, we shall come to that matter and will be discussing the American experience and so on. I agree that there is such a possibility, although I had referred to it earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to discuss new clause 2 before we reach it, Mr. English, because that would be out of order. I merely say to the Minister that the American experience is not what is in new clause 2—it is much more the Australian experience.<br><br>
When talking about the safeguards under clause 12, I was a little surprised that the Minister did not refer to clause 13(8) and (9) which relate to the safeguards. Under clause 13(8) an officer is not entitled to search for anything that is not specified in the warrant. I do not believe that clause 12 makes it clear that that is the position, but the two taken together must mean that clause 12 is limited in that way. I accept that as being a considerable improvement on clause 12 as it stands. That would be fine as long as it was enforceable.<br><br>
Clause 13(9) says that such a search is unlawful. I am at a loss as to the meaning of "unlawful".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. Member. Amendment No. 256 relates to the next clause and the question of admissibility of evidence. I am happy to group new clause 2 with it so that it may be part of the next discussion.</span></p>
<p>12.20–12.25 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Andrew F. Bennett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. English. I can see the advantage of debating and dispensing with the whole question of admissibility. However, new clause 2 refers to parts I, II, III and IV of the Bill. I can see the advantages of having a proper debate on the issue of admissibility now, but we might get into difficulties. May we have a little more time to think about the new clause and to make representations before debating it, rather than committing ourselves now?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The alternative would be not to discuss amendment No. 256 but to discuss new clause 2 when we come to it. What I do not want is for the Committee to have two discussions on admissibility of evidence. That would be very untidy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lyon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I end my contribution on the basis that if clause 13(8) and (9) mean what I hope they mean, clause 12 may not be as deficient as we have argued. But the two must be taken together, and subsection (9) must mean what I hope it means. I must point out that difficulty with clause 12, because we shall return to it on clause 13.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With regard to the point made by the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett), our first discussion is, in any case, about a different amendment. While we are debating it, perhaps hon. Members could think about which course they prefer. I am quite happy to have either an early or a late debate on the admissibility of evidence. But we cannot have both, because that would be distinctly untidy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise briefly to ask one question of the Minister, and to ask him for his help, support and guidance, which are normally forthcoming. I refer him
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0268">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
to paragraph 3.47 of the report of the Royal Commission on criminal procedure, which states
<br><blockquote><p>"We understand it is good police practice, where possible, to invite an independent person to be present as witness of a search, both as protection for the person whose property is being searched and for themselves against allegations of improper behaviour."</p></blockquote>
Whilst I appreciate that it is difficult, if not impracticable, to provide in clause 12 for such action, I wonder whether the hon. and learned Gentleman could tell the Committee, either now or when we debate similar matters in future, just how widespread that procedure is and whether, when the Bill is enacted, it will be encouraged further. Both sides of the Committee wish to avoid alleging that policemen regularly abuse their powers when necessary searches are carried out. But I feel that it would be in the interest of both sides of the Committee if the provision mentioned in the Royal Commission's report formed the basis of, say, a circular from the Home Department, with encouragement given to police forces to carry out that procedure. Perhaps the Minister will reply to that point when he winds up the debate.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 254 in page 12, line 31, leave out subsection (1) and insert
<br><blockquote><p>"(1) Any constable may execute a warrant under this Act or any other enactment, provided that a warrant issued under section 9(1) or section 10 above may only be executed by an officer of at least the rank of an inspector".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to discuss the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 255, in page 12, line 35, leave out "at a reasonable hour" and inserts "not earlier than the hour of seven in the morning and not later than the hour of ten in the evening".</p>
<p>No. 108, in page 13, line 8, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>"if he is asked to do so".</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clause 13 deals with the powers of constables to enter and search premises under warrant. At present, a junior police officer may execute a search warrant against a person who is not even suspected of an offence or against a professional adviser—a doctor, lawyer or social worker—such as we discussed on Tuesday, who holds evidence in confidence.<br><br>
12.25–30 pm<br><br>
Having a search warrant against a person not suspected of an offence and issuing a search warrant where the information held is confidential are sensitive matters. We have only to see the reaction of the British Medical Association to the result of our deliberations on Tuesday to know how sensitive a matter it is. The safeguard suggested by amendment No. 254 is that, in such instances, only a senior police officer should execute warrants that permit him to search for evidence, because the matter is too important and sensitive to be left to a police officer of junior status.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
Subsection (3) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Entry and search under a warrant must be at a reasonable hour",</p></blockquote>
and amendment No. 255 seeks to add precision to the concept of "a reasonable hour". The suggestion is that it should be not earlier than 7 am and not later than 10 pm.<br><br>
Safeguards are still contained in subsection (3), to the effect that, if there are grounds for suspecting that the evidence may not be found at a reasonable hour, the constable may go at a different time. Given that safeguard, it seems reasonable to stipulate that searches should take place between 7 am and 10 pm.<br><br>
I know that the Minister will say that the police would not normally search outside those times anyway, but unless we are specific there is always the danger that, on occasions, the police will say, "Why not go in at 5.30 am?" It is the thought that that might occur, without the good reason that I have cited, that makes one fear a situation reminiscent of a police state. I need not develop that argument, but one can think of few possibilities more objectionable than police descending on premises at times of the night when people are alseep or unprepared for such an intrusion.<br><br>
I see that, yet again, both the Alliance Members of the Committee have chosen to be absent, but I should like to refer to the point at issue in amendment No. 108, which stands in their names. It concerns the need for a police constable executing a warrant to identify himself. The present wording adds
<br><blockquote><p>"if he is asked to do so"</p></blockquote>
The amendment suggests that those words should be deleted to bring the clause into line with clause 2, where the Minister has already said that he would consider sympathetically a similar change. That would make for consistency between the undertaking that he has already given and the undertaking that I hope he will now give.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Christopher Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make one further point on amendment No. 255, about the time of day, and on amendment No. 254, about the rank of the police officer.<br><br>
It is worth remembering that, in the White case, which was decided by Mr. Justice Mars-Jones with exemplary damages, entry into the house was made by officers of constable rank and took place at 12.45 am. I shall not go into the details, but it is no good congratulating ourselves on our wonderful system of justice, just because after a number of years some pecuniary recompense was given to two people who had been abominably treated and who had had their house torn to pieces unlawfully.<br><br>
12.30–35 pm<br><br>
The Committee should try to lay down regulations as far as possible—we cannot guard against everything— that that will not occur again. I wish to draw the Committee's attention to the fact that both amendments are relevant to that case. There was no one above the rank of constable involved and the unauthorised entry took place at 12.45 am. I have a large dossier of similar cases. Night-time entry by policemen, especially by those in plain clothes, is seen as horrific an experience as night time entry by burglars. It is incumbent on us to give greater protection against entry to the homes of

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
citizens, whether suspected of dishonesty or not, in hours when they would normally be expected to be in bed asleep. There is a difference and I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind when replying to the amendments.</span></p>
<p>12.30 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the notes on clauses which the hon. and learned Gentleman kindly made available to the Committee, it is pointed out with reference to clause 13(1) that there are seven or eight existing Acts of Parliament which provide that
<br><blockquote><p>"a warrant may be executed only by a constable named in the warrant".</p></blockquote>
The notes on clauses refer to the restrictions—those are
<br><blockquote><p>"that a warrant may be executed only by a constable named in the warrant"—</p></blockquote>
and state:
<br><blockquote><p>"these restrictions have no clear justification of principle and unnecessarily hamper the police".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will explain that statement.<br><br>
Some of the Acts of Parliament to which I referred date back to the 1930s, some to the 1950s and one is as recent as 1974. If that restriction—if that is the right term—has applied over the years, to sweep it away as the clause will do underlines the necessity for acceptance of amendment No. 254 that was moved so ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South (Mr. Dubs).<br><br>
It would also benefit the Committee if the Minister would consider the notes on clauses referring to the restrictions hampering
<br><blockquote><p>"the police, particularly as regards operations involving regional crime squads".</p></blockquote>
It has always been the view of my hon. Friends in the Committee that the trend over the years towards bigger police forces may lead to the creation of a national police force, and we deplore that. Regional crime squads are specifically mentioned in the notes on clauses with regard to warrants. That rings alarm bells in the ears of some of us. If those restrictions are swept away, regional crime squads may be deployed extensively in that sort of operation.<br><br>
12.35–40 pm<br><br>
We need from the hon. and learned Gentleman a little more detail and background about the reason for the wording of the notes on clauses. That is not a criticism of the draftsmen. Would he merely state as boldly as the notes do that the restrictions are unnecessary and illogical, They will certainly not satisfy my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, South. If the clause is left as it is, it underlines the necessity for pressing amendment No. 254.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I turn first to amendment No. 108— this was moved in absentia—and I am happy to accept the principle. It is generally regarded as good practice for a police officer who is executing a search warrant to identify himself. I am happy to accept the intention of the amendment that that should be done in all circumstances and not only when asked. That cannot impose
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
any burden on police officers and it offers a measure of reassurance. I am happy to recommend acceptance of the principle of the amendment, although I cannot, for technical reasons, accept the way in which it is drafted. We shall deal with that at a later date if the Committee is agreeable.<br><br>
Amendment No. 254 requires that no search warrant under the Act be executed by a police officer below the rank of inspector. I shall deal first with search warrants granted under clause 9 in respect of information or material held non-confidentially. That would impose a substantial fetter on the operational flexibility of the police. What is primarily important are the safeguards imposed on the powers of random searches. We have, rightly, gone to great lengths to decide what shall be specified by the applicant and what the magistrate who is applied to shall give his mind to.<br><br>
We believe and have been advised that, especially in cases where several searches have to take place at the same time—one can visualise important cases in that category—such a fetter would unjustifiably and harmfully get in the way of the police doing their job in the way that we want them to do it. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.<br><br>
The argument is more persuasive in relation to clause 10 because that deals with material that is more sensitive and I can more readily understand the reason for the amendment. Circumstances may arise when several searches have to take place at or about the same time and in different places. I must have careful regard to that. However, I am confident that when a search under the provisions of clause 10 is to take place, the police will recognise it as a matter requiring very great care.<br><br>
12.40–45 pm<br><br>
I feel confident that, whenever practicable, they will want to ensure that a senior officer takes charge of that. But I remind the Committee that such searches will take place only when a production order has been made and disobeyed, or when it has not been made in the first instance because the circuit judge is satisfied that it would not be right to do so as the likely effect would be that the material being sought is disposed of.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will consider whether—I believe that it will be the practice in any event—that should be reinforced by guidance in the form of a Home Office circular to chief officers, showing that as a general rule and in all but the most pressing circumstances the lowest-ranking officer in charge of the execution of such a warrant should be an inspector. I undertake to draw my right hon. Friend's attention to what has been said today; I am sure that he will consider it sympathetically.<br><br>
The remaining point relates to night-time entry. This is the first time that a Government have sought to set out a code of what powers are available and how they should be exercised. Following that principle, we believe it necessary and desirable to include the provision that searches will take place only at a reasonable hour. But the problem with trying to say that should be not after 10 pm or before 7 am, for example, is this.<br><br>
In many instances, that would meet our purpose, but in others it would be reasonable to search between
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1982-1983V007P0I0270">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
those hours and unreasonable to do so before, or after, them. It is unfortunate that, time and again, our natural desire to be absolutely specific and to draw nice, hard and fast and clear lines is frustrated by the endless variety of circumstances in which police officers could be called upon to carry out their duties. What is reasonable for some—perhaps most—promises can be unreasonable for others.<br><br>
We should be satisfied with putting into statute for the first time the stipulation that a search will be unlawful unless it is carried out at a reasonable hour, and then leave matters there. We shall create problems, and unnecessary difficulties for the police, if we try to write in specific times. Therefore I cannot recommend acceptance of the proposal by the hon. Member for Battersea, South.<br><br>
The hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape) raised a further point in connection with new clause 12—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Snape</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not realised that I was being so imprecise that my remarks would be immediately forgotten! I was referring to the sweeping away of existing restrictions in respect of warrants.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. I did not note down the hon. Gentleman's point at the time, as I was thinking of something else; I hope that that makes things better, and not worse! Nevertheless, it is an interesting point.<br><br>
When we consider the various occasions on which Parliament has intervened to give such a power, it is difficult for us to see a consistent thread. The Royal Commission drew attention to that and said that the provisions are piecemeal and hotchpotch and do not give police officers particularly clear guidance. For example, without studying the relevant statutes, I do not know why it was thought necessary in the Biological Weapons Act to restrict the executing of a warrant to the police officer named in it. Indeed, perhaps only an officer who is immune to biological weapons would want to apply for one!<br><br>
I agree with the conclusion that is implicit in the Royal Commission's report that the proposal is not necessary. There is no sinister influence or purpose. We are not seeking to enable dawn raid to be mounted by vastly increased regional crime squads or a national police force. It is done in the interests of uniformity, where that can -be achieved without harm to other proper interests. We are following the broad course mapped out by the Royal Commission. We are trying to put into statutory form for the first time a code that governs the granting and exercise of powers of entry and search.</span></p>
<p>12.45–50 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome what the Minister says about amendment No. 108, although I have come to the disturbing conclusion that if a member is absent from Committee, he has more powers of persuasion than if he is present. I hope that the Minister will not continue like that, or some members will doubt whether they should be present in order to influence him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Baker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Dorset, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
Gentleman suggesting that those absent are conducting a stop and search operation for defectors ?</span></p>
<p>12.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer quickly, before you Mr. English, say anything.<br><br>
They might well be doing that, as one defector was announced in the papers today.<br><br>
I welcome what the Minister has said about amendment No. 254, although I should like him to answer two further questions about it. Can the Minister assure us that the guidance from the Home Secretary will be made public? Will the guidance incorporated into police handbooks similarly be made public? If not, we shall know what the Minister has told us today, and we may know of the Home Secretary's guidance, but we shall not know the terms in which it will be incorporated into the handbooks used by the police in their operations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All circulars from the Home Office to chief officers of police are made public. I see no reason why this one should not be made public.<br><br>
As to what goes into police handbooks, I hope that there will not be another eruption from the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price). I stand by what I have said. The commissioner has undertaken that an edited version of the handbook will be made available. I made a note this morning to find out when it will be available. I said that I hoped it would be ready available by the end of January.<br><br>
I am not responsible for what chief officers of police put into their handbooks, but, if there is a Home Office circular, chief officers will want to ensure that their forces know of the guidance and abide by it in all cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Price</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement that, although the ides of February have become the ides of March, he hopes that his promise in Committee will be fulfilled. We look forward to finding out what has been left in the handbook, when it is available in the Library.<br><br>
Do I take it that the Minister promised the handbook by the end of February?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Mayhew</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dubs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note what the Minister has said, and I hope that the handbook will appear sooner or later. I suspect that the police are having difficulty in taking out the large chunks that they do not want us to see, before it is made available. That is the only explanation for the time that this is taking.<br><br>
On Amendment No. 108, the Minister had great faith in the way in which the police would interpret "a reasonable hour". Although I take his point that the hours specified in the amendment might not be the most reasonable for all citizens, because of their working hours—although there are exceptional circumstances— the Minister's faith is not shared by all of us. That was the reason why we tried to introduce safeguards in clause 13 and other clauses.<br><br>
I am not convinced that the police will all read the <i>Hansard</i> reports of these Committee debates to acquaint themselves with the Minister's undertakings on their behalf. That is not a faith that we share.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
12.50–55 pm<br><br>
Nevertheless, in view of the concessions that the Minister has made on two of the three amendments, I think that it would be appropriate to beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
