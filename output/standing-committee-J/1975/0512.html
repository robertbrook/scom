<p><i>Question proposed—[11th May]</i>—That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should deal with one or two residual points on this clause. I think I dealt with the point raised by the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), who asked me to explain the position of stock in trade exemption for foreign companies—that is, companies that are non-resident. I think that I was able to satisfy him as to why the exemption does not apply in those cases.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) asked me to explain the meaning of lines 8, 9 and 10 on page 31—the last three lines in subsection (2). These words are put in to ensure that the special addition would not cease running in cases of this kind. The subsection provides that if the disposal is for no consideration that will not stop it falling under subsection (1). This, I am advised, is important because, if the disposal did not fall under subsection (1), special addition would cease running on that disposal instead of continuing in the provisions of subsection (3). So those three lines are put in to ensure that special addition does not stop running, and for the benefit of the taxpayer or company.<br><br>
The other assurance he asked for was a general assurance that the stock in trade exemption was available in all circumstances within a group. The answer is "Yes", except where the transfer is to a non-resident company, and I have dealt with that.</span></p>

COMPANY CEASING TO BE A MEMBER OF A GROUP</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 349, in page 32, line 25, after 'if', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'after 12th September 1974 and'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Amendment No. 350, in page 32, line 43, after 'unless', insert 'after 12th September 1974'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments would prevent the de-grouping provisions in Clause 21 applying where the company leaving the group of companies acquired the interest in land before 13th September 1974. There is no need for Clause 21 to operate in these circumstances, because any disposals before that date could not have been made with the intention of avoiding development land tax.<br><br>
It is necessary for this anti-avoidance provision to apply to disposals after 13th September 1974 because they could have been made with the intention of avoiding the tax. However, for acquisitions of land before 13th September 1974, there is no need for the de-grouping provisions of Clause 21—that is, the provisions whereby, if a company leaves a group, there is a deemed disposal of the land, if it was acquired within six years.<br><br>
These two amendments make it quite clear that the provisions do not apply to that land because it was acquired before the intention to have the tax was announced, and the land was acquired without knowledge that a tax of this kind would be imposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome these amendments for the reasons which the Minister has given. They limit the de-grouping arrangements where the transaction could not have been made in contemplation of provisions of the Bill. I shall have some comments to make which bear on this general topic in connection with Amendments Nos. 211 and 212. I do not wish to say more except that we are happy with these amendments.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1163">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1105</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 211, in page 32, line 31, leave out the time of severance' and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'its acquisition of that interest'.</p></blockquote>
We are dealing in Clause 21 with the general situation of what we may refer to as de-grouping, which is where any company leaves a group but prior to its leaving that group it was affected by the provisions of Clause 20 and the consequential arrangements of the Bill for companies within a group.<br><br>
Under subsection (2) if company B leaves a group and it had at some earlier stage acquired land or an interest in land potentially subject to the tax from company A which remains within the group, it is treated as having sold and immediately re-acquired that interest
<br><blockquote><p>"immediately after the time of severance—"</p></blockquote>
in other words, at the time that it leaves the group. It seems to us that it would be more reasonable, and in practical terms more convenient, if the severance were to relate back to the time when the property was transferred from company A to company B rather than being applied at the time when company B leaves the group.<br><br>
We feel that it is anomalous that the company ceasing to be a member of the group can crystalise charges to capital gains tax and development land tax at different dates. As I understand it, capital gains tax might have been incurred with effect at the date of the transfer of the property from one company to the other within the group. There is, therefore, a good argument for harmonising the arrangements so that a single date is involved.<br><br>
It could perhaps be argued by the Government that this might reduce the liability to tax because it would bear as a result of this fall to be chargeable as at the earlier date. But I think that the circumstances of the present sufficiently dispose of that argument since transactions which might have taken place a couple of years ago would in fact have been on the basis of much higher market values than they would be today, and property values can go up and down or down and up according to a number of economic and other circumstances.<br><br>
We therefore think that it would be sensible for the time of charge to tax, both for capital gains tax and develop-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1106</span>
ment land tax, to be brought into line and that we should have a common date. It is suggested that the amendment, by substituting the words "the time of severance" for
<br><blockquote><p>"its acquisition of that interest".</p></blockquote>
should achieve this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 211 seeks to bring the provisions in the Bill regarding companies leaving the group into line with the capital gains tax provisions which, as the hon. Gentleman quite correctly stated, are different from what we envisage in this legislation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 211 is the one he moved and the next amendment we will be taking is Amendment No. 212. To some extent the one is related to the other, but I will address my remarks to Amendment No. 211.<br><br>
We decided in this legislation that it is probably more logical for the charge to apply when the company leaves the group, and possibly the capital gains tax provisions were not so logical, if one can apply logic to a tax. The capital gains tax provisions deem a situation where the disposal takes place at the point of acquisition by the company leaving the group, whereas here we have decided that, because the trigger is the company leaving the group, it is at that time that we wish to withdraw the group exemptions and provisions. It is logical that disposal should take place, and be deemed to take place, at that time, and not at the earlier time when the company acquired the land as a member of the group.<br><br>
For gains tax purposes the latter has been chosen. I suggest to the Committee that this is a more logical and sensible way of dealing with it. Apart from one anti-avoidance point in relation to land transferred before the appointed day, there is no question here of paying more or less tax. As the hon. Gentleman said, one does not quite know how the tax will fall in these circumstances.<br><br>
My main argument is that it makes more sense that the trigger should occur at the moment when the company leaves the group because it is at that time that the de-grouping provisions apply, or cease to apply, and at that time the land is deemed to have been sold and reacquired.<br><br>
There is not much between us here, but there is an avoidance point. If land were transferred before the appointed day
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1164">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1107</span>
under this amendment, it would escape development land tax if later a company were to leave the group after the appointed day because under the amendment the trigger occurs in respect of the time when the land was acquired by the group. If it was acquired before the appointed day, there would be no charge to tax.<br><br>
Therefore, to stop that loophole—if loophole is the right way to describe it—we think our provisions are more sensible. The main argument is that we think it is a better way of dealing with it than by the capital gains tax provisions.<br><br>
I accept that there is a difference here. I accept that lawyers and accountants may find it irritating to have one rule for one, and another one for another. But we think we have arrived at the right solution here, and we do not see why we should have slavishly to follow the capital gains tax provisions when, in our opinion, this is the better way of dealing with the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's reasoning. I do not think this is a great point of principle in the Bill. I do not want to make a Schedule 6 speech, but it seems to me that it would be a good thing if we tried to avoid, as often as possible, cases where a single transaction was deemed to be chargeable to different taxes on different dates, because when we reach Schedule 6 we shall have to consider what happens when one has a development land tax disposal before a disposal for capital gains tax or trading, and equally positions where the timing is reversed or where they are simultaneous. Clearly the simplest of the cases is where they are simultaneous.<br><br>
Perhaps the Treasury has ideas for changing the arrangements for capital gains tax in this respect. I agree that harmonisation might more reasonably be achieved the other way round. We do not wish to press this matter. It is helpful to know that it was considered seriously by the Treasury in choosing these arrangements.<br><br>
This is not an amendment that we wish to press to a Division. There is a difference of opinion, but we can leave it at that. Perhaps the Opposition are more mindful of the problems of potential taxpayers and their difficulty in coping with their liabilities in assessing what it is, the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1108</span>
more complicated are the provisions. Therefore, this suggestion for simplification did bear in mind those taxpayers' interests. Having put the point on record, and in the light of what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 212, in page 32, line 34, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'but so that no sale and reacquisition treated under this section as having been made before the Appointed Day shall result in liability to development land tax'.</p></blockquote>
To some extent, this amendment is consequential on Amendment No. 221 and is covered by the remarks already made by the Minister of State in relation to Amendment No. 349. Had we altered the Bill, by accepting Amendment No. 211, it would have resulted in a number of retrospective situations which would have taken back the time of an event, not from the time of severance—when a company leaves the group—but back to the time of acquisition which would have related to actions long before development land tax was conceived.<br><br>
It would have been necessary to make a provision in line with Amendment No. 349 that no transactions should be caught if they took place before 12th September 1974. This amendment proposes that the effective date should not be 12th September 1974 but the appointed day, which is expected to be in August this year. The reason is that one cannot expect such detailed provisions to be understood on the date of the publication of the White Paper "Land" in September 1974 and, furthermore, it is unlikely that the potential anti-avoidance moves which the Minister has mentioned would actually have taken place, in terms of changing the structure of groups of companies, in the intervening period.<br><br>
If not the appointed day, we would have been willing to accept the date of the publication of the Bill. However, the Government have gone some way towards meeting our thinking on the straight part of this amendment, as opposed to the consequential part, by introducing Amendment No. 349.<br><br>
Nevertheless, I should like to hear the Minister's comments on my remarks on this Amendment.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1165">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1109</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment follows on, to some extent, from Amendment No. 211 and deals in the main with the same points regarding the movement out of the group by a company which has acquired land from another company within the group.<br><br>
The amendment states:
<br><blockquote><p>"but so that no sale and reacquisition treated under this section as having been made before the Appointed Day shall result in liability to development land tax".</p></blockquote>
The legislation, of course, envisages a situation where the sale and reacquisition would take place after the appointed day. The land may have been acquired before the appointed day, and, as a result of the last Government amendment I moved, if land is acquired before 13th September 1974, there will be no problem. If the land has been acquired before the appointed day but the company does not leave the group until after the appointed day, the sale and reacquisition will take place at that point and there will be a charge to tax. If that did not happen and if a sale and reacquisition took place before the appointed day, there would be no charge to tax. But the situation to which the hon. Gentleman refers is where there has been an acquisition and, indeed, a transfer within the group before the appointed day, but where the sale and reacquisition takes place afterwards.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman says that is unfair because such a transfer would have taken place before the tax came into operation and should therefore be exempted. I tried to deal with the point on the last amendment. It would be possible to try to avoid the tax, for example, by transferring property from one company in the group to another and after the appointed day shifting the company out of the group, and on the basis of what is behind these amendments, thus avoiding development land tax, although, of course, the actual benefit to the taxpayer would occur after the tax had arisen.<br><br>
The transfer would have taken place before the appointed day, but the taxpayer would be getting the profit—if I may call it that—after the appointed day. For that reason, we think it fair that tax should be charged at that point. But if there is a sale or reacquisition before the appointed day, there will not be a charge to tax.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1110</span>
I think we have gone some way to meet the hon. Gentleman by providing that land acquired before White Paper day should not come within the legislation. Although I see the point that the hon. Gentleman is making, I cannot accept Amendment No. 212, which would exclude from charge to tax those companies which left the group after the appointed day thereby avoiding payment of considerable sums of development land tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 356, in page 32, line 35, after 'where', insert either—(i)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 357, in page 32, line 42, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'or (ii) the relevant interest or part thereof acquired by the chargeable company as mentioned in subsection (2) above was acquired from a company which has been wound up, dissolved or struck off the register under section 353 of the Companies Act 1948'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If connected companies leave a group together the severance rules do not apply if they remain part of a separate grouping themselves. But if one of the companies concerned, perhaps the original owner of the interest in land, no longer exists, although the intention of the transaction would have been the same as would have been achieved where the company existed, and it were to leave the group at the same time as the current owner of that interest in land, it cannot obtain deferment because the original company no longer exists.<br><br>
Therefore, Amendment No. 356, which is a paving amendment for Amendment No. 357, and Amendment No. 357 itself, provide that where the company acquiring the land—the chargeable company—had received it from a company which no longer existed because it had been wound up, dissolved, or struck off the register, arrangements should be made for the deferment to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 356 and 357 would prevent, as the hon. Gentleman has said, a notional disposal under Clause 21. If the company from which the company leaving the group acquired the interest has ceased to exist
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1166">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1111</span>
—in other words, if company B leaves the group and acquires the land from company A, but in the mean time company A has been wound up, dissolved, or disappeared for some reason—the de-grouping provisions, if the amendments were accepted, would not apply and there would be no charge to tax in company B, which would then leave the group with the benefit of the grouping provisions.<br><br>
I am not quite clear against which injustice the amendments are directed. I do not see why it should be argued that in that kind of case the company leaving the group should have the benefit of not having a charge to tax when, if it has acquired land from a company that is still in existence, there shall be no charge to tax. I do not follow the point the hon. Gentleman is making. Be that as it may, the fear and the danger would be—hon. Gentlemen do not like to talk of tax avoidance and neither do I, but it is a fact of life—that a company within the group that acquires the land could then be wound up, dissolved, or cease to exist, but before doing so could transfer the assets to another company in the group; that company would be shunted out of the group, as it were, and if the amendments were accepted there would be no charge to development land tax at that point of time. Indeed, the charge might have been avoided in the future merely because it had acquired the interest from a company that had ceased to exist and it would be quite easy to put that company into liquidation. There would be scope for avoidance because it would be possible to dissolve the first company and thereby get the benefit of these two amendments.<br><br>
But the principle is this. I do not see why in the one case that the trigger should apply and in the other case, where the company is dissolved or wound up, the trigger should not apply. It would be fair to treat both in the same way. It could be argued, of course, that the trigger should apply in neither case, although there are avoidance difficulties. But once that argument is accepted there must be some kind of charge at the point where the company leaves the group. This applies for capital gains tax purposes, as the hon. Gentleman explained earlier. Furthermore, I do not see why in the one case it should be allowed and in the other case it should not. For
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1112</span>
those reasons, I cannot recommend the Committee to accept Amendment Nos. 356 and 357.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not much encouraged by the Minister's reply. The difficulty with all the provisions of the Bill is to strike a balance between the venting mechanisms for avoidance and not penalising the natural processes of commercial activity. Although at this point we would not wish to press the amendment in its present form or without further reflection by the Minister, I think that there could be situations which would be caught, unless there is such an exemption, which it would not be the Government's intention to catch.<br><br>
Clearly, it is difficult to describe hypothetical circumstances. The liquidation of a company is not by any means done always for acts of distress or for changing the structure of a group for tax reasons. Where such circumstances exist, or may have existed, we feel that it would be proper for some provision to be made. I agree that it is difficult to give any commitment, but would the Minister be willing, without commitment, to consider this aspect to see whether there is any way in which such legitimate situations could be separated from what might be deliberate avoidance behaviour by groups of companies? Would the Minister be good enough to give further thought to the point which we have raised?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I did not do full justice to the hon. Gentleman's argument. I see the point that he is making. There could be cases where the transfer within the group took place quite involuntarily, in the sense that the company would be wound up and would transfer its assets to another company in the group. That asset could be land with development value. If the other company then left the group, the trigger would occur.<br><br>
I doubt whether it would ever be possible to provide for such a situation without the danger of avoidance. I suppose elaborate clearance machinery could be devised and we could introduce into the Bill tests of <i>bona fide</i> commercial reasons, as there are in other legislation. This is cumbersome and difficult and, in the end, gives great discretion to the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
I wish that I could help the hon. Gentleman, but I am afraid that it would not be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1167">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1113</span>
right for me to say that I shall look at the matter because, even if I were to say that, I do not see how we could meet him. I recognise the argument that the hon. Gentleman makes, but I could not give a commitment to the Committee that I would look at this sympathetically because there are considerable problems of avoidance and I have no doubt that the loophole would be exploited. It would be difficult to prevent it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 350, in page 32, line 43, after "unless", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"after 12th September 1974 and—[<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'unless the Board shall otherwise direct'.</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to make subsection (4) somewhat less absolute in its application. We are still talking about the de-grouping provisions, and it has been explained to us that there could be a number of kinds of <i>bona fide</i> severance which should not automatically trigger off deferred liability to development land tax. I will give one or two examples of the situation we have in mind.<br><br>
5 p.m.<br><br>
Company A might be wholly owned by company B. Company A might have a surplus of capacity and another company, not within the same group, which I shall call company C, might wish to take up that surplus capacity. For one reason or another, perhaps finance, or in order to share in the profits of the exercise, company C might wish to take an equity stake in company A. That could mean that company A, although remaining a subsidiary of company B, would be less than a 75 percent. subsidiary and therefore, although the firm would not leave the group in the absolute sense, for the technical provisions of the Bill it would have to go through all the process of severance.<br><br>
I shall not elaborate on the subject, but not infrequently a new equity partner is brought in to run a company which in practice, though not a 75 per cent. shareholding, remains a proper subsidiary of another group. I came across a case in banking which involved the ownership of a hotel. A hotel management company
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1114</span>
was invited to run a hotel which occupied premises on land held by another company. The management company was willing to do that only if it was allowed to acquire a substantial equity investment. For good commercial reasons, therefore, the company which owned the hotel premises sold a shareholding to the other party. Again, in such a case severance would technically take place.<br><br>
In such circumstances, we suggest that the severance provision should not necessarily be applied with complete rigidity. In the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), who dislikes such impurities—I hope that he does not read the record, otherwise I have no doubt that he will have at me later—I submit that in the practical world in which we live, some things on occasion have to be left to discretion even when they concern the Board of Inland Revenue.<br><br>
Although it is not necessarily the ideal way in which we should wish the provision to operate, tabling an amendment in the terms set down gives me the opportunity to raise this potentially important issue. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's comments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to give the Board of Inland Revenue a discretion to decide whether the trigger shall operate when a company leaves its group. I shall now make a speech that I have heard often from Opposition hon. Members, saying that we cannot possibly give the Board of Inland Revenue this kind of discretion; it is not right or fair, and we must have certainty in tax legislation, otherwise the citizen is not fully protected.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that in some cases discretion has to be given, despite the views of his hon. Friend. I am not saying that it cannot be done in this case. In this case I cannot see any guidelines within which the Board could operate its discretion.<br><br>
If a body has discretion to do something, it has discretion to act within a certain area or context to do certain things. It is given certain powers and duties and it is given certain guidelines. In this case I do not know how the Board could decide whether in one particular group the provisions would apply, and not in another group. I do not see any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1168">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1115</span>
criteria by which the Board could decide in these cases. That would obviously lead to great injustice.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman said in his example that where a company ceases to be a 75 per cent. subsidiary and becomes a 51 per cent. subsidiary, for the purposes of the legislation, it is de-grouped because we are concerned with 75 per cent. subsidiaries. He said that in reality the company is still a member of the group because it is 51 per cent. owned.<br><br>
A problem that parliamentary draftsmen have had in many tax statutes when giving relief to groups is how far to go. Groups are extremely complicated, and framing legislation to give relief to groups of companies is therefore very complicated. In most cases 75 per cent. has been the requirement for the definition of a group, as for capital gains tax purposes, for example. If we go even further to 51 per cent., the legislation becomes even more complex. I do not think we can go that far because we would then be in a very difficult situation.<br><br>
I recognise the hon. Gentleman's point that, once it ceases to be 75 per cent. owned, it is de-grouped, although it may still be owned if it is 51 per cent. This problem arises in other parts of fiscal legislation, and I do not think there is a practical way of meeting the point. We have to draw the line and we draw it at 75 per cent. which is perhaps the more important shareholding, because the owner of a 25 per cent. interest is in a position to stop a winding-up. He is in a position to stop the company doing most things. He cannot do much himself, so perhaps 75 per cent. is a more relevant figure than 51 per cent., although I can see the point the hon. Gentleman was making.<br><br>
On this amendment, one could not possibly give the Board this kind of discretion because there are no criteria on which they should operate. Should they operate in all cases on 51 per cent. or in some cases on 51 per cent? Should they operate if they think this is an industrial company and not a commercial company? The ramifications are enormous, and I am sure the Committee recognises that. I therefore cannot recommend acceptance of the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1116</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have given the Minister of State some ammunition with which to deal with my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budge), who is currently absent. Equally, he has given some ammunition in the opposite direction, so the exchange of fire cancels itself out.<br><br>
I agree that the amendment, as tabled, is not an ideal way of dealing with the problem which I posed. This point was made to us in a number of different ways. One way it could have been done would have been for the whole of this provision to be suspended unless the Board made a positive order that it should operate. That would be too cumbersome in practice and would merely turn a positive decision into a negative one, or the other way round, whichever way one looks at it.<br><br>
There are enormous practical problems in dealing with groups of companies and the situation where, for tax reasons, a company ceases to be a member off the group at 75 per cent. or below 75 per cent., whereas, for the whole of the rest of its purposes, it remains a member of that group in management terms, in some forms of taxation terms, and in the structure of its business.<br><br>
The difficulty here is that the more, and the more substantial, taxes which are applied to companies, the greater the problem becomes. If there were relatively few taxes, and the difference in the rate and the incidence of tax were not all that heavy, it would not matter so much for the grouping provisions whether the special resolution figure of 75 per cent. applied. But in the real world it could make an increasing difference. The example I gave demonstrates the sort of transaction which could otherwise be on the increase for perfectly good reasons in the future.<br><br>
It may often relate to the availability of industrial or commercial premises, or whatever it may be. I do not want to get into the problem of where we do and do not defer tax for industrial or other use. The point is that interests in land and property may often be the aspect of the assets of a company which makes it sensible for them to be occupied or shared by other commercial users. I use the word "commercial" in the widest possible sense of other company users.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1169">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1117</span>
I do not think that we should, therefore, hasten to impose what in effect could become a substantial restriction because of the size of the tax liability for the indefinite future without being aware of what we are doing.<br><br>
Therefore, when taxes at very high rates are imposed, we need to reconsider whether the grouping arrangements and the tax treatment between 51 per cent. and 75 per cent., which may have operated more or less satisfactorily in the past with other taxes, will operate equally satisfactorily in future. This tax is due, on the prognostication of the Government, to rise to 100 per cent. It therefore is of a different order from other taxes which might fall to be charged where a company can no longer group itself for tax purposes with its parent.<br><br>
I must agree that the amendment cannot be pressed in its present form. As I explained, it was tabled for this point to be made. I do not want to detain the Committee with it, because it is now adequately on the record. Its effects may not be easy to see in practice, because it will prevent certain arrangements from taking place. It will not be visible in the number of transactions which are caught by it, because many transactions which would be caught by it will not take place because of the provisions themselves. Special vigilance thus will be needed by those parts of Government concerned with company law and taxation to bear this position in mind, particularly if and when development land tax is imposed at a higher rate.<br><br>
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 392, in page 33, line 7, leave out from '(5)' to end of line 34, and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'For the purposes of this section, where the interest in land held at the time of severance by a company leaving a group does not exactly match the interest held at the time when the project of material development was begun, so much of the deferred liability to development land tax will become payable as corresponds to the extent of that company's interest at the time of severance'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Amendment No. 371, in page 33, line 32, leave out 'as near as may be'.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1118</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment, in effect, substitutes a different form of words, of considerably greater brevity, for Clause 21(5).<br><br>
The Inland Revenue's booklet of explanatory notes says that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (5) deals with the case where land has been developed for industrial purposes and the interest held at the time the land was developed does not exactly match the interest held by the company leaving the group. In these circumstances so much of the deferred liability will become payable as corresponds to the extent of that company's interest at the time of severance."</p></blockquote>
5.15 p.m.<br><br>
In view of what I have just read out the Committee will not be entirely unaware of where I received some of the inspiration for the wording of Amendment 392, but as we are also considering Amendment No. 371 I should like to comment at the outset on that as well. It is a rather simple amendment, to leave out the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as near as may be"</p></blockquote>
which appear in the last line but two in subsection (5) on page 33.<br><br>
I shall not read out the whole of subsection (5) because hon. Members have it in front of them, but it really is a purple passage in this Bill. I recommend to any members of the Committee who have parties of school children asking them what goes on in Committee rooms upstairs, and whether Members of Parliament ever actually have to take account of legislation before them, to read to them subsection (5), because it is, in its plain form, pretty nearly incomprehensible. "Subsection (2) above" refers to deemed development land tax disposals
<br><blockquote><p>"at the time of severance";</p></blockquote>
"section 19(1) above" relates to use "for the industrial purposes"; "subsection (6) below" relates to "part disposals".<br><br>
The phrase
<br><blockquote><p>"Section 19(1) above and section 26 below"</p></blockquote>
shows the incredible precision of the draftsmanship of this clause, but then come the fantastic words "as near as may be". Having stated the precise circumstance in which these exact things have happened one has to make a corresponding adjustment in the amount of value chargeable to tax, and after all that precision one comes to realise that one cannot do the sum after all and has
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1170">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1119</span>
to say "as near as may be". Really, one wonders whether it is all worthwhile. As with so many other points in this Bill, it seems that the intention can equally be achieved by a straightforward statement of what the subsection is intending to achieve.<br><br>
By adapting the words of the book of explanatory notes—because parliamentary draftsmanship is a technical and abstruse art—it seems that the words might achieve in the practice of the law the same effect. I must confess that I have left out of the draft of Amendment No. 392 the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as near as may be"</p></blockquote>
in order to be consistent with my other amendment. It seems to me that if one has precise provisions of this kind it is hopeless to throw away the whole thing in the last line but two by putting in the words "as near as may be".<br><br>
There is an element of protest in this amendment, but one can carry the exactitude of draftmanship too far. I shall not labour the point any more, but it will be interesting to hear the Minister's reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has tabled two amendments. Amendment No. 392 seeks to take out the present words in subsection (5) and insert words which, as he admits, are to be found in the explanatory booklet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They are slightly different.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that entirely, but in substance they come from the explanatory booklet, which of course is a simplified explanation, as the draftsman would be keen to remind us, of the Bill.<br><br>
Amendment No. 371 seeks to leave out the words
<br><blockquote><p>as near as may be"</p></blockquote>
and the hon. Gentleman asked, quite fairly, why have this lack of precision when everything else appears to be and is intended, so precise? I could go back and deal with both of those points by reading my brief. I do not always do so, but it is a splendid defence if one is in difficulty.<br><br>
Clause 21(5)—and this may be of assistance to those who follow these debates and have to operate legislation—deals with the case where the interest
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1120</span>
which is treated as having been disposed of at the time of severance—and that is called the relevant interest—does not exactly correspond with the land which was developed for industrial purposes. The land which was developed is called the material interest.<br><br>
For example, one member of a group may have developed 10 acres of land for industrial purposes and subsequently—and I now refer to Clause 19 which contains the industrial purposes deferment—transferred 3 acres to another member which within six years leaves the group. The 10 acres comprising the material interest is not the same as the 3 acres the chargeable company holds at the time of the severance, nor is it a part of it.<br><br>
On the other hand, the 3 acres were once part of the 10 acres. So we have 10 acres being developed by one company, and 3 acres being transferred to the company leaving the group. In such circumstances, so much of the deferred liability will become payable on severance as corresponds to the chargeable company's interest at that time. In the example, the liability will be triggered off in respect of the 3 acres, which is perfectly fair and reasonable. But that is the sort of situation which the draftsmen must try to meet in subsection (5) of this clause.<br><br>
That subsection achieves the result provided that the company leaving the group is assumed, for the purposes of the triggering, to make a part disposal of the material interest—that is, the 10 acres. The granted interest corresponds as near as may be to the relevant interest—that is, the interest held by the company when it leaves the group—in so far as the relevant and material interest overlap—that is, the 3 acres.<br><br>
The reason the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as near as may be"</p></blockquote>
are included is that the relevant interest—that is, the interest leaving the group—could be of a different nature from the material interest. For example, one could be a lease and the other could be a freehold. The words have no other significance, but it is necessary to keep them, otherwise there could be doubt about how Clause 21(5) operates where the interests are of a different nature.<br><br>
I have read the explanation to the hon. Gentleman, and I hope that it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1171">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1121</span>
now clear. The draftsman says that he must have the words in in case we have two different interests, and I must therefore entirely accept his views in this matter. I do, however, accept what the hon. Gentleman says, the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as near as may be"</p></blockquote>
do not seem very precise and I am prepared to look at it to see whether they could be made more precise although, again, the draftsman has obviously chosen them with some care to cover this situation.<br><br>
I now turn to Amendment No. 392 which is taken from, or the words are inspired by, the explanatory notes. I am told that the words would not do. In particular, they do not explain what the project was, who should pay the tax triggered off by the disposal, how the amount of that tax should be related to any tax which had previously become payable, or how it should be related to any tax which subsequently becomes payable.<br><br>
The last sentence in my brief says that the drafting of the existing Clause 21(5) removes any possible doubt about these matters, so on that splendidly certain and Olympian sentence I think I shall rest my case. I think that the hon. Gentleman will take the point that we do our best in explanatory notes, but it is an explanation, and the difficulty and danger of trying to explain complicated tax provisions in simple language is that they are not meant to deal with simple situations. When one tries to explain them simply, error and uncertainty can creep in. I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept that, despite the complexity of subsection (5), the wording is more precise than the wording of Amendment No. 392. I shall look again at the words
<br><blockquote><p>"as near as may be"</p></blockquote>
to see whether a more precise form of words is possible.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have always thought that subsection (5) of this clause would do good justice to Esther Rantzen and Cyril Fletcher, if anybody watches their programme on Sunday night, because it is one of the choicest confusions that has ever been put before us.<br><br>
I am being thoroughly offensive, of course, to the parliamentary draftsmen.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1122</span>
I am glad that the good gentleman who wrote the explanatory notes has been complimented by our including amendments in wording almost the same as his own. I say these kind things about the gentleman who had a part to play in writing these explanatory notes because he was in my private office for three years. He had good training, and I am glad to see his name going down in history—as it were—in our amendment. The explanatory note explains the clause clearly, but it is extraordinary how, when it gets to the end of the clause, it throws the baby away with the bath water. After line upon line of complication, it pulls the plug out and says
<br><blockquote><p>"as near as may be".</p></blockquote>
As the Minister was talking, I am afraid that the muse got me and I came up with this little poem:
<br><blockquote><p>"By and larges" and "generally speakings"</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>And also "as nearly as maybes"!</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>I think that the drafting has creakings</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Or the draftsman is suffering from rabies."</p></blockquote>
Again, I am sorry to be so offensive to the parliamentary draftsmen, but I hope the Minister will see whether he can reduce this clause to the few words which my hon. Friend has proposed in this amendment. They are admirably concise, and if they do not cover every detail, as we have previously said in these debates, we rely to a great extent upon the Inland Revenue interpreting the tax statutes reasonably without confusing the taxpayer too much when reading a subsection such as this. I hope that the Minister will look at this again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I greatly enjoyed the Minister's brief. Amendment No. 392 was by no means a facetious amendment, and I am glad that it has been seriously received. I should have said that it is not so much a probing amendment as an epexegetic amendment to try to get on record an explanation of what the subsection means. I am not sure that we have got to the bottom of this problem of
<br><blockquote><p>"as near as may be",</p></blockquote>
and I welcome the Minister's comments on it.<br><br>
I do not want to press this matter any further. I would only say that the words in the explanatory notes and in Amendment No. 392, which derive from the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1172">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1123</span>
explanatory notes, refer to the extent of that company's interests at the time of severance. The natural way of reading
<br><blockquote><p>"as near as may be"</p></blockquote>
in that context would be in relation to "extent". That seems to be a curious interpretation. If it were to be phrased in a different way so that we were talking about the "nature" of the interest, rather than the "extent", it would certainly clarify this situation for the benefit of those who will need to work by the book—as it were—in future.<br><br>
I wonder whether it is possible to have in the Bill clauses which do not contain cross-references and definitions to every other detailed point. I am not pressing the point, but I would have thought that the wording of Amendment No. 392—perhaps not in detail but certainly in general—leaves no doubt as to which company one is talking about, which will be the chargeable person, what interest in land one talking about and so on. By hanging references to subsection (2) or Clause 19(1) one is virtually only stating the obvious, because of one refers to the purposes of the clause one automatically refers to the context in which the words appear.<br><br>
I am grateful for what the Minister has said. It will be helpful to have the comments which he read out from his brief on record and perhaps at a later stage we may benefit from his reconsideration of whether
<br><blockquote><p>"as near as may be"</p></blockquote>
as a phrase needs qualifying or amending in the light of the doubt that it raises. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 363, in page 33, line 43, leave out subsection (7).—[<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p>
<p>5.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 358, in page 34, line 8, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'or if they are sold to a common purchaser'.</p></blockquote>
These words relate to the situation described in Clause 21(8), and the circumstances of subsection (8)(<i>a</i>) describe a case where two or more companies leave a group at the same time and,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1124</span>
having done so, still constitute a group. In such a case, a small group is leaving a large group, and the transaction, where liability has been deferred because of grouping, is contained wholly within the smaller group. If the smaller group leaves the larger group, it is still intact as a group for the purpose of the postponement of development land tax. That is the situation to which subsection (8)(<i>a</i>) relates.<br><br>
The amendment suggests that a similar continuation of deferment ought to apply if both the companies involved in the movement of interest in land from one to the other remain within a single group, even though they themselves do not constitute that group. A situation could arise in this way: they could be sold to another group of companies, and the other group of companies might have a structure in which its property assets were held in one company and its trading arrangements were carried out through another company. Of the two companies which left the original group, one might be sold to one subsidiary of the new group and the second might be sold to another subsidiary. They would not then themselves constitute a group, but they would be sold to a single purchaser in the sense that the ultimate holding company of the new group would be the owner of both of them, just as, in a rather different way, the ultimate holding company of the original group had been the owner of both of them.<br><br>
A common purchaser could include a non-corporate purchaser: an individual who might acquire—again for perfectly good reasons—the two companies separately and, in such a case, while they remain in the ownership of the common purchaser, it would be sensible that they should, for the purposes of this deferment, be regarded as if grouped together. I therefore feel—even though I am prepared to accept that there may be problems in the wording of the amendment—that an important point is raised here. We should like to see provision in the Bill for grouped companies to continue to be regarded as being grouped under subsection (8)(<i>a</i>) if they go into another group, although they may be subsidiaries of separate branches within that group or if, in some other way, they are sold to a common purchaser who becomes owner of both companies at the same time.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1173">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1125</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to give benefit to group provisions in a case where two companies are bought by a common purchaser—"common purchaser", I assume, means the same purchaser. Those two companies may not be associated for the purposes of the legislation.<br><br>
Under the legislation, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, if there is a subgroup—two companies which are subsidiaries of a parent, yet one is the subsidiary of the other—and the sub-group moves out, with one company owning 75 per cent. of the other, it is treated as a group in itself if one has acquired land from another company in the group which does not move out, that situation does not arise, but if the two companies move out, one being a 75 per cent. subsidiary of the other, and one having acquired land from the other, they are treated in themselves as a group and the trigger does not occur as they possibly move into another group.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman seeks to extend that to a situation where the two companies are bought by a common purchaser, but are not parent and subsidiary, as it were; they are not associated within the definition in the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Or co-subsidiaries.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They might be co-subsidiaries of a single sub-parent, but they will not be parent and subsidiary in themselves. They do not classify as a sub-group or a group in themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They could be subsidiary and sub-parent, but they could be sold to another group separately so that they no longer remain directly parent, sub-parent and subsidiary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me put it this way: under the legislation, one of the companies has to own 75 per cent. of the shares in the other company. In that situation, they are a sub-group in themselves. The hon. Gentleman wants to extend that situation to the case where one company does not own shares in the other or where shares in those two companies may be owned by another company, but they do not own shares one in the other. The legislation merely provides for a case where one company owns
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1126</span>
75 per cent. of the shares in the other, the two companies move out of the group, and one has acquired land from the other.<br><br>
Unfortunately, if we were to accept the amendment—and there are many cases involving groups—we should be open to considerable avoidance possibilities—quite apart from other difficulties which might arise from the meaning of "common purchaser" and who is to be regarded as common purchaser.<br><br>
I have a page of notes with two splendid examples of how the loophole could be exploited if the amendment were accepted. I do not propose to read it to the Committee, because it is extremely complicated and I do not understand it, but I assure the Committee that the Inland Revenue has been very diligent in bringing forward these two splendid examples to show what could happen.<br><br>
For capital gains tax purposes the principle behind the amendment would not apply. The capital gains tax provision is the same. We give relief only where two companies move out and they are both associated companies. To extend relief in this way would lead to tax avoidance problems and also to considerable complications as to who is a common purchaser. For those reasons, I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the keen interest in all parts of the Committee on this matter, would it be possible for my hon. Friend to circulate to the Committee a summary of the points that he leaked to us?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am willing to give my hon. Friend a copy, provided the Inland Revenue does not have the copyright of it. I do not know whether schemes are copyrightable, but I should be happy to let my hon. Friend have a copy of the examples, in view of his interest in these matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The use of the words "common purchaser" were not meant to be a social slight on the potential acquirers of these companies. Perhaps we should have said "single purchaser" or defined it more narrowly to a corporate situation.<br><br>
But I am not convinced, in spite of the fact that I know that the Treasuary is alert to these matters and might perhaps
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1174">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1127</span>
work out ways, on the basis of the wording, which some sort of avoidance operation might be mounted.<br><br>
I revert to the point that provisions which may apply in the case of other taxes at lower rates must be reconsidered if we have a tax at 66⅔ per cent. or 80 per cent, rising to 100 per cent. There may be any number of <i>bona fide</i> transactions, in which two companies have formed part of an original group, say group A, and may never have been sub-parent and subsidiary, purely for the structural reasons that I mentioned. One company may own the property in which the other firm is the operating company. It may be that they are sold out of group A in that non-parent and subsidiary situation into group B where the corporate structure is different.<br><br>
In the basic situation, I cannot see how there can be any avoidance. Naturally avoidance could occur if the situation was not precisely expressed. I accept that nine words, or whatever the number is, on the Amendment Paper may not cover the matter in detail.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not referring to the drafting when I mentioned the possibility of avoidances. I meant the concept itself, the fact that it is much looser than the idea of a sub-group moving out of a company. Once we consider the position of a common purchaser, however we define it, we are in a looser situation and the possibilities of avoidance are greater. I did not mean to criticise the drafting.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that, but I think that criticism of the drafting is fair, or at least comment on it, because it is impossible for us to table amendments which would absolutely achieve the results we wish. It is right, however, that we should table them in order to raise issues which may be of potential importance.<br><br>
The concept is looser but, I suggest, looser within a framework, and that framework, is the group of companies. As the Minister reminded us, it is not actually very loose because we only have to get down below 75 per cent. and the group is outside the provision. We are not dealing with a situation in which companies can whiz in and out of these groups so that arrangements may be made
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1128</span>
to avoid development land tax. We are talking about situations in which the two companies concerned were within the same group and in which, if we are talking about a corporate common purchaser, they end up within another same group.<br><br>
Without being too complicated, it should be possible to devise provisions which would allow such a transfer in cases other than those in which the two companies concerned are a sub-parent and a subsidiary both of the vendor group and the purchaser group. I shall not press the amendment in the form we have it. I think that the Minister sees the point. Equally, at this stage, I shall not ask him to read out a technical explanation of how avoidance might work.<br><br>
I ask the hon. Gentleman, however, to reconsider whether, in view of the high rates of tax which may apply for development land transactions, this is not another of those cases in which in the past capital gains tax may not have mattered. At development land tax rates it may matter very much, and may prohibit a host of perfectly ordinary, desirable transactions which are inevitable in the light of structures of companies drawn up long before development land tax was ever on the horizon.<br><br>
The structure of large groups of companies is often complex, and it may be that parent-subsidiary relationships within the group are not the normal way in which land is held. In fact, the transfer of land from one company to the other may have taken place as the result of a rationalisation of a group, so that the activities in property may be separated and put under the responsible aegis of a director—as in the well-known case of my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury)—who devotes his time to understanding all the problems of property and learning about appropriate legislation such as development land tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right to say that it is common in groups of companies to have a service company for the property interests, which enables a concentration of expertise in that area to be more easily achieved for the benefit of the overall group.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend may be aware, that method has another advantage, in that it facilitates the proper charging for the occupation of land and buildings, so
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1175">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1129</span>
that the operational companies of the group are seen to be earning a proper return on the assets employed. Thus, as has happened sometimes in the past, and still happens to some companies, one does not have assets grossly under-utilised, because no proper charge is appearing in the accounts of the company for the assets held on an historic cost basis.</span></p>
<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend accepted my cue, because I wanted the Committee to have practical confirmation from somebody who has been concerned with such matters as to the way in which they operate.<br><br>
The structure of groups is no longer a simple question of the accident of history. Because of developments in taxation, sometimes companies have been reorganised. But the reorganisation is more likely to have taken place for commercial and administrative reasons. As my hon. Friend explained, the efficiency of a trading company within a group is easier to monitor if it is seen to bear the proper overheads, whether in relation to property or to anything else, which it would incur if it occupied property on a commercial basis from an outside source. Over the coming years a considerable number of cases could occur in which a transaction would involve a trading company and a property holding company, which would never have been in the sub-parent and subsidiary relationship.<br><br>
The issue is of some wider significance. There are possibilities of anti-avoidance, but I suggest that that is not a matter which we should allow to pass without it being on the record that we are aware, as we hope the Government are aware, that in order to deal with yet another type of potential anti-avoidance which might be of a complicated nature, many proper and desirable transactions might thereby be frustrated.</span></p>

<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want only to draw attention to the privileged position under the Bill of the statutory undertakers, and to point out that they are given much greater privilege than charities. We shall come to charities in the next clause.<br><br>
Turning to minor points in the clause, the "appropriate Minister" who, under subsection (3), has to determine whether land is being held for operational purposes by the statutory undertakers is defined in subsection (8). Having defined the "appropriate Minister" for some purposes as having the same meaning as in the Town and Country Planning Acts, for other purposes "the appropriate Minister" has to be determined by the Treasury. We are left in considerable doubt as to who is the Minister who will decide whether land is being held for operational purposes. At what stage will the Treasury indicate who is the "appropriate Minister" for any particular statutory undertaker?<br><br>
The second point is that we are given a list of statutory undertakers in subsection (7). Is it intended that this shall be a fixed list, or is there any intention of extending that list? I do not think that there is any power by order to extend the list of statutory undertakers, unless—and my memory fails me here—there is that power in the Community Land Act.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1131</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. I am sure that his memory will tell him that in the Community Land Act there is a power to extend the list of statutory undertakers. That power is in Section 5(1)(<i>c</i>). The lists from paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are included in this Bill. Therefore, the power to extend, which is given under the Community Land Act, does not extend from the Community Land Act to this Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury). He has a far better memory than I can muster in being able to recall that this came in the Community Land Act. But it raises the problem that, under Section 5(1) of the Community Land Act 1975 a reference to statutory undertakers can mean any one within three different descriptions, in (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). Paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) are moderately definite:
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) persons authorised by any enactment to carry on any railway, light railway, tramway, road transport, water transport, canal, inland navigation, dock, harbour, pier or lighthouse undertaking, or any undertaking for the supply of electricity, gas hydraulic power or water".</p></blockquote>
That is a fairly wide definition of statutory undertaker brought into Clause 22 of the Bill which we are debating.<br><br>
The second group is:
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>b</i>) the British Airports Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, the National Coal Board, the Post Office and any other authority, body or undertakers which by virtue of any enactment are to be treated as statutory undertakers for any of the purposes of the Act of 1971 or the Scottish Act of 1972".</p></blockquote>
That, of course, refers to the Town and Country Planning Acts.<br><br>
That, too, is a fairly wide definition. A fairly large number of statutory undertakers are taken into account. But there it stops short. Perhaps that is a good thing, too. It does not include paragraph (<i>c</i>) of Section 5(1) of the Community Land Act 1975. That paragraph says:
<br><blockquote><p>"any other authority, body or undertakers specified in an order made by the Secretary of State under this paragraph".</p></blockquote>
I assume that the list within the Development Land Tax Bill will not be extended by any order. I am not passing judgment on whether that is good or bad. It may be that the Government would wish to be a little more flexible on this point, or they may be satisfied that if they do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1132</span>
wish to extend the list they will do so in primary legislation and not in subordinate legislation. Perhaps we could have on the record what the Government's intentions are in that case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow my right hon. Friend on the point about statutory undertakers with two queries. First, it is a contrast to my mind between the wording in the explanatory note on subsection (5). The explanatory notes say:
<br><blockquote><p>"A grant of a lease or other interest out of the relevant interest made in pursuance of the statutory undertakers' functions"—</p></blockquote>
those are the key words—
<br><blockquote><p>"made in pursuance of the statutory undertaker's functions"</p></blockquote>
shall not be treated as a disposal, whereas the text of the Bill is:
<br><blockquote><p>"with furthering the purposes of the statutory undertaking".</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether the wording in the Bill is not rather wider in effect than that in the explanatory notes. It seemed to me that by the words
<br><blockquote><p>"furthering the purposes of the statutory undertaking",</p></blockquote>
one could grant pieces of property to a supplier and say that it was furthering one's purposes—that it helped one to carry on one's undertaking. It seems potentially wider than
<br><blockquote><p>"in pursuance of the statutory undertakers' functions",</p></blockquote>
which is a phrase definitely confining the matter to disposals which are precisely related to the functions of the statutory undertakers.<br><br>
In the list of statutory undertakings, we have, as my right hon. Friend has pointed out, the persons and bodies specified in Section 5(1) (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of the Community Land Act. Then there is a list of additional bodies. Has the Minister made an order in respect of any or all of those bodies under paragraph (<i>c</i>) of Section 1(5) of the Community Land Act, or are they included in this Bill but not in Section 5 of the Community Land Act?<br><br>
Further, why is it necessary to include the British Steel Corporation? That, as a pre-eminently industrial undertaking, would seem not to need the protections provided by the clause, because it already has protections—which we have indeed widened—under Clause 19. Why, then,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1177">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1133</span>
has the British Steel Corporation been included in this group, and other bodies which have Government ownership and an industrial purpose have not been included? It seems an odd man out in this context.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will reconsider the position of the British Steel Corporation. We had an interesting argument about competition when we discussed the barrier between commercial and industrial. There must be a very clear competitive position between the British Steel Corporation and the few remaining small producers of steel which have not been nationalised. Although, in many of its activities, the British Steel Corporation is in a monopoly position and is therefore not competing in, at any rate, certain types of steel production, in other types it is a competitor with private industry. It does not seem to me to be just to give it a privileged position as a statutory undertaker.<br><br>
It is a point that we have raised before and shall continue to raise—that it is ridiculous to give the British Steel Corporation both the benefit of substantial subsidies from the taxpayer and also various forms of hidden subsidy by way of privilege for the purposes of either—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'><i>rose</i>—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall give way in a moment—of either community land tax or development land tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether my hon. Friend could tell us whether there are implications in respect of Community regulations on fair trading, if the British Steel Corporation is given a specially privileged position in our tax structure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. The Minister, who, no doubt, considered these matters during the controversy on whether we should stay in the Common Market, may help us on this point—especially as the position of the steel industry, with its vital effect up on Wales, was, no doubt, something which he considered very carefully.<br><br>
I recollect that the position of the steel industry was considered in relation to various regulations of the Community because it was certainly argued by many people in the Labour Party that it would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1134</span>
not be possible to support the steel industry by various forms of subsidy and protection if we were to join the Common Market. I cannot remember the details of the argument, but it raises an important point.<br><br>
However, I am arguing this matter not from the point of view of the Community but from the narrow point that I see no reason why one particular organisation within industry should be given privilege simply because it is nationalised.</span></p>
<p>6.0 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with that point and couple with it the point made by the right hon. Gentleman, namely that charities were not doing as well as statutory undertakings.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) is under a misconception, I am sorry to say. The private steel companies, about which he expressed concern, are not disadvantaged in any way as a result of the fact that the British Steel Corporation is covered by Clause 22.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) asked why the British Steel Corporation could not come under the provisions of Clause 19. Why indeed? Perhaps it should go into Clause 19, except that Clause 22 is concerned with statutory undertakers—I am using very loose terminology now—developing for their own use.<br><br>
The wording of Clause 22 is different for a variety of reasons, which I shall try to explain, but the principle is the same. Before our defeat in Committee, Clause 19 was confined to industrial companies developing for their own use. Clause 22 deals with statutory undertakings developing for their own use. Later on, we shall see that charities will develop for their own use—again using loose terminology, because I do not want people to think these are statutory words, but that is the principle behind it—and they get an exemption. There is, therefore, no question of one body—the British Steel Corporation—receiving a benefit, and private steel-makers not receiving a benefit.<br><br>
The wording of Clause 22 is slightly different, partly because we were very conscious of the fact that there may be certain activities of statutory undertakings—electricity and gas showrooms, for example—which we do not want to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1178">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1135</span>
include under the Clause 22 exemption, bearing in mind at that time that Clause 19 was confined purely to industrial purposes.<br><br>
Bearing in mind that the amendment has been passed by this Committee where "industrial" covers commercial purposes, one might want to reconsider whether it is fair to a statutory undertaking to deny this relief to an electricity or gas showroom.<br><br>
The reason why the language is different is that we did not want to extend the statutory undertakers' exemption or deferral to that kind of situation where a shop or a showroom is opened which is part of its undertaking. We do not want to go that far in view of the Clause 19 exemption. I think hon. Gentleman opposite will agree with that, and I hope that it will dispel certain of their suspicions.<br><br>
I was asked whether there was power to extend the list by order. I am glad to tell right hon. and hon. Gentlemen that there is not. We have been scrupulous here, and I am sure the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West will applaud us for that.<br><br>
We do not seek to extend by order an exemption from taxation. I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree that that would the wrong thing to do. If we must extend in the future—we may have to, as statutory undertakers come and go—if some new statutory undertakers come along, we may have to extend—[<i>Interruption.</i>] The hon. Gentleman should not be so pessimistic and gloomy—we shall amend by statute and not by statutory instrument. That is the proper way of dealing with fiscal matters.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman asked who the Minister would be, and how the Treasury would decide who it would be when there was not an appropriate Minister. The Treasury will decide when it is necessary to decide. The Treasury does not do anything unless it really has to. If an issue arose in which there was a question of taxation in respect of a statutory undertaker's activities, and if it was not clear who was the appropriate Minister, the Treasury would have to decide who the appropriate Minister would be in the circumstances, and that appropriate Minister would decide whether what was being done was within
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1136</span>
the powers or within the activities of a statutory undertaker.<br><br>
The final point that was raised was on subsection (5). The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) thought that the words
<br><blockquote><p>"consistent with furthering the purposes"</p></blockquote>
went wider in the explanatory memorandum. I do not know whether they do, but I take the point that they are different. The intention is that they should not go any further. Indeed, the intention behind subsection (5)—and I think this is achieved—is to allow a case where, for instance, the British Airports Authority would have to give a lease to an airline to operate part of a terminal. That would be within the Authority's statutory powers, and that is the kind of situation that we envisage in his subsection. I shall look at the words again to see whether they do go wider, because the words here are or statutory importance—as the hon. Gentleman will appreciate—rather than the words of the explanatory memorandum. I shall look at this wording to see whether there is anything in that point.</span></p>

<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CHARITIES: INTERESTS IN LAND HELD ON 12TH SEPTEMBER 1974</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 347, in page 36, line 39, leave out from disposal 'to end of line 45 on page 38, and add
<br><blockquote><p>"or deemed disposal of an interest in land".</p></blockquote>
We are now coming back to charities, because we have discussed charities on Clause 11. Clause 23 deals with charities specifically and deals with cases in which the tax is deferred on certain disposals by charities. Clause 23, as I understand the position, deals with actual disposals, and Clause 24 deals with the deemed disposals.<br><br>
This amendment would go the whole way in relieving charities of the development tax. Therefore, it would, of course, be necessary, if the Committee decided to accept the amendment, to move when we get to it that Clause 24 should not stand part of the Bill. The amendment
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1179">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1137</span>
is intended to take the place of both Clause 23 and Clause 24, and the result of its being made would be to leave as Clause 23 only three lines which would say quite shortly and succinctly:
<br><blockquote><p>"Development land tax Shall not be chargeable on any realised development value accruing to a charity on the disposal"—</p></blockquote>
and then the amendment
<br><blockquote><p>"or deemed disposal of an interest in land."</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to relieve charities entirely of liability for tax whether it be on disposal of their—if I may so call it—operational property where they are carrying on their charity, or disposal of their investment property, or development of their operational property, or development of their investment property. The justification for asking that they be so relieved is comprised in the arguments that I put forward on a previous occasion when we debated them and which have been strengthened by the representations that I have received since that last debate.<br><br>
Briefly, the reasons for relieving charities from liability for development land tax are, first, that they have never been subject to tax. This is a completely new innovation that they should be subjected to development land tax. I agree that there are distinctions between development land tax and other taxes, certainly those on revenue, but this really is an innovation in our tax laws.<br><br>
Secondly, charities are providing a community service, and the basis of development land tax, so it is alleged by those who advocate it, is to give back to the community a value which has been created by the community so that community services can be carried on. Nobody can say that charities are not carrying on services to the community. If they were not doing so, they would not come within the definition of charities.<br><br>
Thirdly, charities should not be deprived of the revenue which can be gained from an increase in the value of their property. I call it revenue because frequently charities rely up on this for revenue purposes. They look upon an increase in the value of their property which is realised or put to a charitable use as money available to continue to run the purpose of the charity.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1138</span>
Those are my three points for the relief of the charities from tax: they have never been taxed before, they are providing community services, and many of the charities will be unable to provide those services if they are deprived of the value which they gain from holding property which increases in value.<br><br>
I do not think the Committee would wish me to rehearse the whole of the arguments put forward on a previous occasion. This is the same kind of provision which we were urging the Committee to accept previously to relieve the charities entirely of the liability to tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman quite rightly said that we had a long debate on this issue on a previous clause and the arguments were rehearsed and gone into in great detail. As he recognised, I do not think it will be discourteous to the Committee if I do not go through all those arguments again, but I should like to reiterate that we are not discriminating against charities in this legislation. In fact, we are giving a considerable amount of relief as a result of the representations which have been made to us.<br><br>
I think I should again make the point that although some charities may well rely upon the increase in the development value of land to fund their activities, we are in that case talking about a small minority of charities. Most charities will not be affected by this provision because they will not be in the position of having to pay any development land tax. We are concerned with only a small group of charities which may be fortunate enough—I do not criticise them, nor am I casting aspersions upon them—to have some development value which they could turn to good account.<br><br>
The only problem we could see arose mainly in the case of the churches and I have dealt with this argument previously. Churches sometimes have to move out from old to new centres of population, and they will need to dispose of that land. They will be able to do that at a profit because the land will have value for offices, hotels or even factories, and they will then be able to reinvest in new land and a new church in a new centre of population. Representations were made to us about that, and I think we have met the point, in that land acquired
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1180">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1139</span>
before 12th September 1974 does not come within the legislation. A move by a church from an old to a new centre of population before that date will not in any way be affected by the legislation. Any future move may well be affected, but that will be a considerable time into the future, and I have no doubt them churches will make dispensations and order their affairs accordingly. I think that it was recognised in earlier debates that if there was a problem it was a medium to long term problem in the case of churches. We have gone a long way to meeting their difficulties.<br><br>
Even in the case of land acquired after 12th September 1974, where that land is developed for the charity's own use—I must make it clear that I do not want to put forward an argument that is not a proper one—"own use" is defined narrowly in the legislation and, for example, does not include a mixed development where the charity sets up an office block in order to get the income from that investment.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Gentleman used the correct expression when he talked about investment purposes. Indeed, development for investment purposes is not within this exemption. But where the charity develops the property for its own use, in a sense almost for its own physical use—if that is the right way of describing it—the exemption is there, as it is for statutory undertakers and for industrial purposes, and possibly for commercial purposes.<br><br>
We are not discriminating against charities. We have gone a long way to meeting them, but at the end of the day we have to balance the one against the other for the purpose of the legislation to return the benefit to the community. Alhough charities serve the community, the basis of the legislation is that most of that benefit should be returned to local authorities.<br><br>
I do not think I need to say more. We have dealt fairly with charities. I cannot accept this extension because it would create a two-tier market. Charities would be free to invest in land at no taxation liability, where other groups and bodies would be taxed quite heavily if they were to do so. To created such a situation would not be fair either. We have widened that, we have framed our legislation and we have met the legi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1140</span>
timate problems of the churches. I therefore ask the Committee to reject the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must answer the points that the Minister has made even if, to some extent, they repeat the previous debate. The Minister has crystallised the point by saying that the Government rely in the Bill on the fact that there are only some charities which own property, or rely on property, or rely on the increase in value of property as part of their assets and income.<br><br>
The Bill recognises that there are charities owning property which will become subject to the tax. To some extent, the Bill gives relief to the property owned on 12th September 1974. The Minister says that this was in order to meet the churches. But there are many other charities which own property and rely on that property, not only for their operational purposes, but for producing income for running the charity.<br><br>
We must distinguish between two kinds of property in dealing both with this clause, and the amendment which I am proposing, and the consequence of that amendment on Clause 24. With the operational property—property which the charity is using for its own purposes—the charity cannot dispose of it without becoming subject to tax unless it owned the property on 12th September 1974. It can develop that property and have the tax deferred for a time.<br><br>
So far as its investment property is concerned, although it may have relied for centuries—I mean centuries—on real property for its assets and its income, it is now directed by the Bill to dispose of that property and not to buy more. I am exaggerating when I say that the charity is directed by the Bill to do so, but the ownership of real property by charities is now frowned on by the Government, and any increase in value in that property is no longer an asset of the charity to be devoted to the purposes of that charity, but is an asset which must be handed over—the Minister deliberately said so—to the local authorities. Those who in the past have given to charities for their money or assets to be used for charitable purposes must now see a large part of that go into the hands of the local authorities, which, however good they are and whatever community
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1181">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1141</span>
services they give, are not the charitable purposes to which the asset was to be devoted.<br><br>
I hope that even at a later stage of the Bill the Government will relieve charities altogether. The pressure on the Government to do so is enormous. The Minister has said that this will not affect many charities, but those it does it will affect severely, and to no good purpose</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 348, in page 36, line 43, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(<i>c</i>) was held by the charity immediately before that disposal and that charity either
<ol>
<li>by way of exchange, or</li>
<li>within twelve months of the disposal and with the proceeds arising from the disposal acquires an interest in other land to be used for the purpose of the charity in replacement of the interest the subject of the disposal; or'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
This amendment would insert what amounts to another paragraph of subsection (1), which sets out the occasions on which, as the clause says,
<br><blockquote><p>"Development land tax shall not be chargeable on any realised development value accruing to a charity on the disposal of an interest in land".</p></blockquote>
Here we are dealing with the actual disposal, as I understand it, and not the deemed disposal. As the clause stands, the charity is relieved of development land tax if the land
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) was held by the charity on 12th September 1974; or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>b</i>) was held by another charity on that date and has at no time between that date and the time of the disposal been held otherwise than by a charity;"</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to add
<br><blockquote><p>"was held by the charity immediately before that disposal and that charity either
<ol>
<li>by way of exchange, or</li>
<li>within twelve months of the disposal and with the proceeds arising from the disposal<br><br> acquires an interest in other land to be used for the purpose of the charity in replacement of the interest the subject of the disposal…</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1142</span>
<p>for the community. It deprives them of using their assets for the charitable purposes for which they were set up.</p>
<p>I must ask my hon. Friends, therefore, to join me in pressing the amendment to a Division.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 10.</p>
<p>That can briefly be stated as a sort of roll-over provision—roll-over not only including the proceeds of a disposal for the purpose for which the original property was owned, but also a roll-over in the case of exchange, which may happen frequently with charities.</p>
<p>This would mean the use of their existing assets at any time for charitable purposes, or for the same purposes for which they were holding the property before disposal. This is not restricted to disposal of operational land—again I use the phrase "operational land investment". There is an extremely strong case for saying there should be roll-over provision in the case of charities' operational land, no matter when it was acquired. I should have thought that that sort of case was unanswerable. If the charity is using the proceeds of a disposal, or the increased value by way of exchange property, for its charitable purposes, in the narrow sense for operating its charity, I would have thought there was every reason why it should be relieved of the tax.</p>
<p>Following the principle that the Opposition have argued before, namely, that it is right and proper that charities should be entitled to invest their charitable money so that they have both the possibility of an increase in the value of their assets, as well as the possibility of receiving income from that investment of property, I would apply the amendment to both operational and investment property.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1182">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1143</span>
<p>To some extent, the Bill as drafted meets the roll-over provisions, certainly in the case of property which was held on 12th September 1974. It is a narrow relief and copies relief given in the Community Land Act—the idea that charities must now fall in with all other property owners so far as tax and the acquisition of their property is concerned.</p>
<p>The Minister said in the course of answering the previous amendment that the Bill was not discriminating against charities. True, I want to discriminate for charities. Legislation has always done so in the past when dealing with tax. I see no reason to break that convention, that rule of law, that legislative recognition which we have had over centuries of granting relief to charities.</p>
<p>This amendment would not give nearly all the relief I would have hoped this Committee—and later the House—would accept as right for charities, but at least it would go some way, and I urge the Minister to consider this amendment. I am sure he would wish to retrieve the Government's good name with charities. According to the correspondence and interviews which I have had, the Government really have so offended these good charities that it will take a long time for the Government to get co-operation from some of the charities in future. When the Government lose that benefit which charities can give in dealing with services, which cannot be provided in other ways, then it is a very sad day.</p>
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment, particularly after the rather callous and regimented rejection of the previous point. It involves a matter of very considerable principle, of which Members who are concerned with the welfare of human beings would do well to think.<br><br>
Every time that the Government pass a piece of legislation or make a proposal for a piece of expenditure—and, after all, the present Government claim to be the Government of public expenditure—I do a very simple sum. I represent one thousandth of the voting population of this country and one-thousandth, if one includes children, of the actual population of this country. When, for instance, the Government propose, as they did on 29th April, to increase their spending
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1144</span>
powers under the Industry Act by £1,050 million, that means that from my constituents a million pounds has to be obtained. When the Government propose to give £168 million to Chrysler, that means that from my constituents £168,000 has to be obtained. It is important that we should keep public expenditure in proportion.<br><br>
If one were to go round my constituency, which is one of the most generous to charities—I would not wish, of course, to vie with the next door constituency whose concern for charities in Scotland is so appropriately demonstrated by the Member's absence once more—and attempt to raise the sort of sum that local government will demand, or squander, or which Governments will spend, one could not do so. Charities, such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and the Red Cross, provide services which local authorities would not be able to provide for 100 or sometimes 300 times the amount of money which such charities spend. It is well to remember that to take money away from charities and give it to local authorities in infinitely reducing the service that could be obtained for the individual for the same amount of money. It is the individual with whom all persons in this House should be concerned.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend says that the Government want to keep their good name. I think that was said—if it is not inappropriate to use the adjective—in a charitable disposition, that the Government have a good name left to lose. I think it is unfortunate that the law finds it necessary to make a distinction between heritable and moveable property because the title and the extent of the one property can be differently registered from the other. So the law makes this fictional distinction because of these origins. It has become a matter of doctrine that there is something bad about a heritable investment which requires to be removed, whereas a moveable investment which is to be taxed differently is not considered bad. I believe that it is a general principle of doctrine of hon. Members opposite that there is something wrong and sinful in the ownership of a heritage.<br><br>
Let us take the simple example of a church which must move from the centre of a city because prices may have become restrictive owing to an increase in office
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1183">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1145</span>
building and a congregation no longer exists. It has become irrelevant, and it must move to the suburbs. As I understand it, unless this amendment is made, the church will have to pay tax on the benefit of moving.<br><br>
A worse case would be that of a charity, which may have been in an office for some 100 years but which simply can no longer afford the rates because the value of its property has risen, the value of its back garden has risen, or the value of an adjacent property has risen. It is futile to say that the local authorities should be given the money to spend in the certain knowledge that they will get less of the service for the money than the charity can provide.<br><br>
It is true to say that public charities—which, in a way, is what the Social Services are—have massive expenditure and a great deal of private squalor under them. If we got from the public charities—that is to say, the Government services—anything like the return we get from the private charities we could probably slash income tax by 50 per cent. tomorrow. We should carefully ensure—and Members on both sides of the Committee hold the same interests—that the people who require it, are made the beneficiaries of the services which charities provide.<br><br>
The Government would be cynical and heartless to take the view and the stance that they would rather kill off charities or deprive them of the good work they do by breaking an endless and hitherto unbreached tradition rather than give in on this minor amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like again to draw the attention of the Committee to the position of Church schools and, if I may, I refer particularly to the City of Cardiff where we have a strong tradition of voluntary schools. Because of the development of comprehensive education, the Church has been called upon to make enormous contributions, and it has meant that each family in the parishes of the City of Cardiff—both Roman Catholic and Church in Wales parishes—has been asked to make a substantial contribution in the interests of the community towards the cost of providing the sort of comprehensive
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1146</span>
schools that the parents of the City of Cardiff require.<br><br>
This goes on all over the country, and I merely use the City of Cardiff as an example. We can do it because we had land in the centre of Cardiff which we were able to sell for development purposes and the money raised was used to develop schools in the suburbs. The Bishop of Llandaff school is one example, and St. Teilo's school is another where we have made an enormous contribution to the educational life of the City of Cardiff. Every now and then the Church acquired a certain amount of land, and as the years go by from White Paper day, so the amount of land the Church acquires will, bit by bit, be more and more subject to development land tax when it is used purely for charitable purposes.<br><br>
We have an example, therefore, of the charitable use of development land for the community as local authority schools. I ask the Minister to explain to me why a school provided in one village, shall we say the only school in the village, provided by the Church, is not serving the community as much as the local authority school in a neighbouring village? If there is no distinction so far as the community is concerned, surely the Church should be able to use that development land in the interests of the community as much as the local authority. I suggest that it is the duty of the Committee to allow the Church to continue in the great tradition that it has followed for so many years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like, briefly, to support my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North-West (Mr. Roberts) in what he said about the work of Church schools. As I said on another occasion—I do not want to go through the whole debate again—I feel that there is special value in the work of the Church schools at a time when the religious content of education is somewhat under threat in the State sector.<br><br>
In my constituency I have a Church school which, after 110 years, is being rebuilt. The original school occupies what I believe hon. Members on both sides of the Committee would regard as an interesting position, being in the main shopping street. It occupies approximately 80 ft. of frontage, sufficient for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1184">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1147</span>
four shop units. Luckily, at long last, the Church is able to proceed with redevelopment. The foundation stone has been laid and the building is under way on land behind the site. It is, in fact, part of the disused burial ground of the related church. We shall have an excellent new school there soon. The old premises will be disposed of, and I hope that the trustees will obtain a good price. At the moment, they are all right.<br><br>
It seems to me, however, that in exactly the same way as the Minister recognised, there is a medium to long-term problem for the Churches. There is a shorter term problem for the Church schools, because I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that the life of school buildings—some school buildings that one sees nowadays undoubtedly have hardly any life at all—is shorter than that of Church buildings themselves. There is likely to be a more frequent change in the locational needs of Church school buildings. There may be a change in the age structure of an area which can mean that the number of primary schools, for example, has to be significantly reduced. At the same time, we still need the churches because the population is there. It is simply a different age group. We have seen this happen many times.<br><br>
I submit that the risk to the Church schools arising from the unamended Bill is shorter term and perhaps greater than the risk to the churches. I therefore strongly support what my hon. Friend said about the importance of the work and the threat to that work posed by the Bill's provisions, and I support the amendment in so far as it seeks to relieve the Church schools of the threat to their continuing their valuable work.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has, again, been mainly on principle, whether we should give complete exemption, or whether we should give the kind of partial exemption existing in other legislation.<br><br>
The amendment itself is ingeniously drafted, as one would expect from the right hon. Gentleman, to achieve a certain purpose without perhaps appearing on the face of it that it would breach the principles of the legislation. I am afraid that it does that, as the right hon. Gentleman will realise. We have heard several impassioned speeches about Church schools, but every example given of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1148</span>
hardship would not, in fact, be a case of hardship, because we have covered every example in the legislation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) accepted that his particular school, which has been redeveloped, will not be caught by the legislation and any future redevelopment of that kind will not be caught even for post-White Paper day land, because the school is developing for its own use. It would be caught only for a mixed development, where a shop was built, for example.</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What I was pointing out was that the old school will now be redeveloped for retail purposes. The new school has been constructed on a new site. In due course, because of the more rapid changes one has in the need for schools than in the need for churches, schools will have become redundant, and, merely because they are redundant, they will be redeveloped for another purpose. That is when the problem arises.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If there is a movement out of that community to another place, in the medium-term future there may be a problem. It is not a problem in the short term, and perhaps not even in the medium term.<br><br>
The amendment deals not only with operational land but with investment property. The amendments seeks to give relief where one property, be it investment property or operational land, is exchanged for another. Thus, if a charity has erected an office block and exchanges that office block for another office block, there will not be a charge to tax if there is development value. If there is development value, if this amendment were accepted, there would not be a charge to tax.<br><br>
That is curious because if that office block was sold and the proceeds invested in another office block, I think the right hon. Gentleman would agree that there would be a charge for tax, because this amendment does not cover that kind of situation. The amendment covers only the exchange of one property for another, and not the sale of one property and the reinvestment of the proceeds in another property.<br><br>
I do not want to make a debating point, but if one accepts the exchange
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1185">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1149</span>
point, in logic, common sense, equity, justice and everything else, one has to accept the sale point. It would be unfair in the one case to exchange property for another property and get away without having to pay tax, but if one has to sell a property and reinvest the money in another property, one pays the tax.<br><br>
I am not making a technical point, but the amendment seems to go along those lines.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was not intended to distinguish between exchange and disposal. I did not think it did so. One has to take into account the first part of the clause which precedes the amendment, and that assumes a disposal. The disposal could be by way of sale or by way of exchange. I intended the new sub-paragraph to extend to the proceeds of a sale—a sale being a limited disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to make a drafting point. When one sees the word "exchange", one draws a legal distinction between "exchange" and "sale". They are, of course, two different things.<br><br>
However, I accept that the right hon. Gentleman is concerned with an exchange or sale situation. That is why I said that, although the amendment is ingeniously drafted, it goes to the root of the Bill and seeks to obtain what was sought in the last amendment. If we were to accept this amendment, the whole principle on which we are resting would be undermined.<br><br>
That is not necessarily a reason for not accepting the amendment. The point I am making is that this amendment is no different from the last. As our debate has shown, we are here concerned with whether we have given enough exemption for charities. Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite say "No". We think we have gone a long way to meet legitimate grievances and fears and we do not foresee in the medium term any problems arising from the way the legislation is drafted.<br><br>
I will not go into the arguments again. I think there is a fundamental dispute between us, and for the same reasons that I rejected the last amendment I ask the Committee to reject this one.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1150</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It seems from what the Minister said that the real issue between us is not so much on the land which the charity is using for its purposes—properly operational land—but the investment land. As he will know, this is a point which has been strongly put forward by the National Council of Social Services—that if the Government are reluctant to grant any relief to a charity in respect of land which it holds for investment, at least the Government should allow roll-over provisions on property which it holds for operational purposes.<br><br>
If, for example, a church or, to go to the other extreme, a dogs' home is sold and the proceeds are invested in another church, or whatever the charitable premises may be, it should not matter whether that property was acquired before 12th September or at a later date. I agree that this amendment covers both operational and investment property, but it seemed to me that the Minister's complaint was against the relief for investment properties.<br><br>
If the Minister would think again about the case put forward by the National Council of Social Services, which strongly urged that he should allow roll-over relief for the operational land and premises, I should be a lot happier. But he seems to have closed his mind even to that, and in that case, he is up against all charitable bodies. Not one charity, not one church has written to me and said that it agrees that if it sells its operational land the tax will be payable. Every charity is against this. Of course it is; it is something entirely new which charities will have to face. If they were to be told that they had to face it because they were charities which ran on investment property I think a lot of them would have taken it that way; at least, I think the Nationald Council of Social Services would have done so. But when they are told that, if they sell the property on which they are carrying out their charitable objects if it was acquired by them after 12th September 1974, they will have to pay the tax, they feel that they are being extremely badly treated. Certainly I shal lask my hon. Friends to divide on this amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbakn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to ask the Minister to answer this question, because I think it is important that what

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1151</span>
the Government are doing should be on the record. If a charity is forced to move from one office to another perhaps because it cannot afford to stay where it was, or the communications have ceased to exist, which is very common in rural areas such as mine where there are charitable schools and charitable headquarters of one kind or another and there is an element of development in the price it obtains, does that mean it will have to pay tax on the office it left? In other words, the charity would be taxed on something that it had not contributed to in order to carry out its operations in identical premises in a different place. Is that the position?</span></p>

<p><i>Question according negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 376, in page 37, line 12, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>or if the interest in land was held by a company in which the whole of the issued share capital was beneficially owned by a charity or charities on that date or under the will of a person who died before that date the charity or charities would have been absolutely entitled on that date to that issued share capital if the administration of the deceased's estate had been completed'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment seeks to add a provision to include within the definition of a charity a company in which all the shareholders are charities, unit trusts, or investment trusts which are set up purely for charities and in which charities can invest. It may well be that the Minister will tell me that these are charities, or that they come within the terms of charities because they are units which are bound by their memorandum and articles of association to provide investment for charities. I do not think I need elabor-</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1152</span>
<p>many cases there might not be—there might, in some circumstances, be a charge to tax. The first £10,000 development value would be exempt and the next £150,000 would be charged at the lower tranche. There could be a charge to tax. There might not be, depending on current values, for instance.</p>
<p>We have debated the provisions on how one arrives at base value. At the end of the day, there might be a charge to tax. One cannot get away from that situation. We are concerned with the disposal of property acquired after 12th September 1974. We are not concerned with the development on those premises; we are concerned only with the disposal of those premises and a move somewhere else, and there could in those circumstances be a charge to tax, as I have indicated.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 10.</p>
<p>ate on this. It is self-explanatory, and I hope that the Minister will be able to accept it.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman moved his amendment rapidly and clearly, and he hoped that I would be able to accept it. He mentioned a case where a company might hold units or be some kind of unit trust—I am not sure to which kind of framework he was referring—and he hoped that in such a situation it would be treated as a charity.<br><br>
I do not know whether, if that company was listed for charitable purposes, or was a charity in itself, it would get relief under the legislation. But if it were not a charity in itself and was some kind of investment vehicle to channel investments, I would not think it a charity in its own right, and I could not accept the argument that it should be exempt under the provisions regarding charities.<br><br>
I assume that the amendment seeks to cover a situation where a charity may
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1187">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1153</span>
have a trading company—the charity may own a company which carries on a trade to provide the charity with income. I understand that such situations exist. In that kind of case, very often the trading income of the company is taxed; the charitable exemption does not always apply. I do not wish to get into deep water as to what income is taxable and what is not, because this is an extremely difficult branch of fiscal legislation.<br><br>
However, Section 360(1)(<i>e</i>) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 sets out the exemption given to charities in respect of income or profits. I shall read it to the Committee. There is an
<br><blockquote><p>"exemption from tax under Schedule D in respect of the profits of any trade carried on by a charity, if the profits are applied solely to the purposes of the charity and either—
<ol>
<li>the trade is exercised in the course of the actual carrying out of a primary purpose of the charity, or</li>
<li>the work in connection with the trade is mainly carried out by beneficiaries of the charity."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
7.0 p.m.<br><br>
That is a fairly limited exemption. If a charity forms a trading company which carries on a general trade, in many cases the profits of that company are not exempt under the rule that charitable income is exempt, because they do not fall within Section 360(1)(<i>e</i>).<br><br>
I shall not attempt to explain the position as it is not entirely relevant for the purposes of the amendment. The amendment seems to seek a kind of piercing of the corporate veil—as I think they used to say in company law long ago of the doctrine in Salomon <i>v</i> Salomon that one goes behind the corporate veil. The Government do not intend to penetrate any corporate veils, but I think that this is what the hon. Gentleman seeks. He is saying that, if the shares of a company are owned by a charity, and the company makes a development profit, the exemption should apply as if it had been made by the charity itself. Perhaps that is not the intention, but it seems that he is seeking not to differentiate between a company and the people who own shares in it. That is a basic differentiation that we have drawn in our legislation, and it is basic to the principles of company law. Therefore, I cannot agree with the amendment for that reason.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1154</span>
He mentioned the case of unit trusts. If he has a specific case, we could look at it to see what the precise position would be. But the general principle would be that, if a charity owns the shares of a company, that company is treated as a company in its own right, and if it does not exist for charitable purposes it is caught for development land tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I was so brief that I did not clearly explain the intention of the amendment. It has nothing to do with stripping the veil off anything. It is not asset stripping or anything as complicated as that—nor is it striptease. However, there are two aspects. The Minister dealt with one aspect, that of a charity carrying on a trade by means of a company and owning the whole of the company's shares, and the company being given the limited relief from other taxation to which the Minister referred. I hoped to include that as a charity having relief under the clause—even the limited relief that now remains after my previous amendments have been rejected.<br><br>
The other class, and perhaps the more important, is that of the investment company set up specifically for providing a means of investment to charities, and investing in any property. As long as all its members are charities, it is now entitled to complete tax relief on, I think, capital gains tax, development gains tax, income tax and corporation tax. It should also be relieved of development land tax. That was the intention of the amendment. I think that there will be few cases in which the charity runs its own business through a company, but certainly the investment in the company which has only charities as its shareholders is an important matter to a great number of charities. I should like to see that included as a charity.<br><br>
I should have come better prepared with chapter and verse, but the intention is clear. The drafting may not be as good as it should be, but the principle is that if one has a company and all the shareholders are charities—that is, the company is set up for the purpose of providing a source of investment for charities—it is already recognised in tax law as being free from tax and it should therefore be free from development land tax.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says it should be free from development land tax. He probably means that it should get the same exemptions from development land tax as we are giving to a charity which is not a company. I take it that that is as far as the right hon. Gentleman would expect us to go. Even if we could accept that, he would not expect us to go further and give complete exemption.<br><br>
I am sorry if I did not do justice to the amendment. I find it difficult to differentiate between the kind of situation he would wish and the general situation where a charity owns a company which does certain things. I accept that the company would not be carrying on a trade, but would be receiving investment income. But if that company were to make a development land betterment gain, under the present legislation it would pay the tax. I do not see how we can frame legislation to exclude such a situation without again breaching the principle that we have established that charities are not wholly, but only partly, exempt.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to unit trusts which come under Section 38 of the Finance Act 1965. They have an exemption from income tax or corporation tax, but I am told that they are not bodies corporate in the ordinary sense. I am also told that they cannot hold land directly. That is a minor point, however.<br><br>
I cannot agree with the amendment, but I am prepared to put on paper—if that would be helpful—the present position, the position as we see it under this legislation and how it would affect a company that is owned by a charity. The right hon. Gentleman might like to come back to the point later when he sees the explanation. But, as I understand it, there is no exemption. If it is a company, it is treated as a company, albeit the shareholders may be charities or one charity, and we would still have to treat the company separately. I will write to the right hon. Gentleman clearly outlining the position under the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister. In view of his offer to teach me more about this matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1156</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 213, in page 38, line 21, leave out subsection (6).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 254, in page 38, line 23, after "disposal", insert:
<br><blockquote><p>"or in consequence of a change in the law relating to charities".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Again, I resort to the explanatory notes to see what is meant by subsection (6). It is said:
<br><blockquote><p>"If an interest in land held by a charity on 12th September 1974 ceases, otherwise than on the occasion of a disposal, to be held for charitable purposes"—</p></blockquote>
this is the important point—
<br><blockquote><p>"the interest is treated as having been disposed of and reacquired at that time for a consideration equal to its market value …"</p></blockquote>
The Government could surely have been more generous than that. This means that a liability to tax will hang over the head of the charity for years to come in respect of property, even though the property may have been held on 12th September 1974 for charitable purposes. It would not be much of a tax loss if one could relieve the charity of that contingent liability—a liability if it disposes of the property, perhaps, but not a liability if through some accident of circumstance the property ceased to be used for charitable purposes. It would surely simplify the whole process and be a little kinder and more generous to charities than the Government are being at the moment if they said "You owned this land for charitable purposes on 12th September 1974 and that is that. If this is used for other purposes on some later date we shall not come down on you for the tax." I would hope to see that wiped out altogether.<br><br>
I now come to Amendment No. 254. If a disposal is deemed to take place
<br><blockquote><p>"in consequence of a change in the law relating to charities"</p></blockquote>
that is no fault of the charity. It is our fault in this Parliament, and I should have thought that we could relieve charities of liability for tax in such cases. Perhaps that constitutionally, ought to be left for inclusion in a Bill which amends the meaning of charities, and therefore I merely throw that in as an example of how the charity may not be to blame for changing the use of its property.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1189">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1157</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 213 seeks to leave out subsection (6). Subsection (6) and, indeed, subsection (7) are intended to counter avoidance of development land tax by means of what are known as time charities. There is a similar provision in capital gains tax legislation. That is a charity set up for a certain period of time which then comes to an end and of course gets the exemption from development land tax. However, I am advised that the kind of avoidance about which we are worried can be met by subsection (7), and I shall say something more about that subsection when we come to a later amendment. The kind of avoidance about which we are concerned can be met by subsection (7), and in those circumstances I am advised that subsection (6) is not necessary. I am glad that I can meet the right hon. Gentleman wholly and exclusively by accepting this amendment to leave out subsection (6) from the clause.<br><br>
If the Committee is disposed to accept that amendment, Amendment No. 254 falls as being unnecessary, and I see the right hon. Gentleman is nodding in agreement. I recommend to the Committee that we should accept Amendment No. 213 to leave out subsection (6) and no doubt the right hon. Gentleman will in that case consider withdrawing Amendment No. 254.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment made.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 214, in page 38, line 33, leave out
<br><blockquote><p>'at any time after the disposal' and insert 'within six years after the disposal, and prior to the application of the proceeds of disposal'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take Amendment No. 255, in page 38, line 33, after 'time', insert within six years'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After that brilliant success I trust that I shall have another one. At any rate, I am going to score out the number of lines that we have removed from subsection (6), and if at a later stage I want to add a few lines to the Bill and the Minister tells me he cannot have the Bill cluttered up with that sort of thing I shall tell him that we have saved the lines here.<br><br>
However, let me proceed with Amendment No. 214 which is on very much
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1158</span>
the same point—the question of having a liability to tax hanging over the head of the charity for a period of time. We seek here to limit that time. What subsection (7) does—again the explanatory memorandum tells us—is to say:
<br><blockquote><p>Where the disposal of an interest in land is, under subsection (1), not chargeable to DLT but the body making the disposal later ceases to be a charity, the development value realised on the occasion of the 'exempt' disposal becomes chargeable."</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that we could put a time limit on that period of liability so that the charity need not have to enter it into its account as a contingent liability for ever. Let us give a termination date of six years, a period well-known to tax law, and abolish that liability after that period of time.</span></p>
<p>7.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the right hon. Gentleman thought that he had been entirely successful with this amendment as well, I am sorry to have to disappoint him. I cannot meet his amendment completely, but I think we can partly meet his point. I could not agree with regard to the period of six years. However, Amendment No. 214 raises, as the right hon. Gentleman recognised, a very valid point, and representations have been made to us to the effect that Clause 23(7), as drafted, could impose a charge on charities that are not strictly time charities. Here we are concerned with time charities in regard to avoidance. Representations have been made that the provision is too tightly drafted and could affect other charities. For instance, a charity may have come to the end of its useful life and be wound up, and may dispose of all its assets, for perfectly laudable and proper reasons. If the charity had made one or more exempt disposals, the trustees would find themselves faced with a DLT liability and no funds to meet it. It was not our intention to strike at that kind of situation but subsection (7), as at present drafted, could do so.<br><br>
There is another point in relation to subsection (7) and that concerns the case of mergers, where one charity ceases to be a charity on merging with another. If the first charity had made exempt disposals before the merger, the subsection could impose a liability. Again we would wish to amend subsection (7) in a way to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1190">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1159</span>
avoid both those problems—the one concerning charities coming to an end quite genuinely, and the other in regard to the merger of one charity with another.<br><br>
In the time available it was not possible to put down an amendment, although consideration has been given to it, and I have here an amendment which seeks to add a new subsection to Clause 7 to deal with these points. However, it would be out of order to ask the Committee to deal with this amendment now, and it would not be fair. The amendment seeks to meet those two points. Perhaps I may hand the amendment in, as it were, and it may be possible to discuss it at a later stage, perhaps on the next clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a third category which must be considered. It is what, in Scotland, we call a <i>cy-près</i> scheme, as a result of the old alliance with France, whereby the functions or intentions of a charity are frustrated and have to be transferred to another organisation or scheme to carry out, as far as it can designate the charitable purposes of the original intention. Will the Minister ensure that the amendment will cover that third category?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman raises an important point, as the <i>cy-près</i> doctrine is not confined to the law of Scotland. It is also found in the law of England. I do not know about the law of Wales, since we lost the law of Wales about 900 years ago. The situation is a fairly common one, where the purposes of a charity come to an end and it is necessary to distribute the funds among other purposes as closely as possible, allied to the original purposes of the charity. I hope the amendment covers that, but I will make the necessary researches and make sure that it does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. If the Minister asks for the amendment which he has circulated to be accepted as a manuscript amendment, I personally shall be quite happy to have it in the Bill. It think my hon. Friends would be equally happy. I would much
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1160</span>
rather the amendment was accepted in this way than that we set it aside and forgot the arguments which we have advanced today. If you are willing, Mr. Crawshaw, to accept it as a manuscript amendment, let us have it in the Bill right away.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It appears to me that this would come immediately after the amendment which we are now discussing. If it is convenient to the Committee, I will put it to the Committee immediately after we have dealt with Amendment No. 214.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for meeting my amendment, at least part of the way. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. Is it possible for more of us to see copies of the amendment, or I wonder whether the Minister might feel that something could be done which would enable us to see the amendment before we discussed it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I was under the impression that the amendment had been distributed. Clearly hon. Members need to know what it says.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. There is probably an easy way to solve this. We shall be meeting to-morrow morning. If the Minister would move that we no longer sit now, we should be able to see the amendment on the Amendment Paper to-morrow morning, starred though it may be, and then we can decide whether it should go in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that would meet with the general acceptance of the Committee.<br><br>
Further consideration adjourned.—[<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</span></p>
<p><i>Committee adjourned at twenty miutes past Seven o'clock till Thursday 13th May at half-past Ten o'clock.</i></p>
