	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. May I make an apology and a request? You will observe that there are some starred amendments on the Amendment Paper in the high numbers—on the first page Amendment No. 410, and similar numbers on the next pages—which are consequential on a decision of the Committee on Thursday. I am sorry that they appear starred, but as the Opposition are doing throughout the Bill, we had carefully to study what amendments would be consequential on the decision of the Committee on Thursday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Would you be good enough to call those amendments, Mr. Crawshaw? They are purely consequential, but the decision of the Committee would be a nonsense without them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is aware, of course, that it is not normal practice to call starred amendments. I am never averse to it, provided it meets with general agreement, but that is only to call them. I do not know whether the Minister has any observations to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no objection. I may be able to say something later about this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will call Amendment No. 410, which is a starred amendment. With this, it will be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 411, in page 29, line 44, leave out 'purposes of the trade' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or commercial purposes of the trade other than for offices'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 412, in page 30, line 4, leave out 'purposes of the trade' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or commercial purposes of the trade other than for offices'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1046</span>
	<p>No. 413, in page 30, line 15, leave out 'purposes of the trade' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or commercial purposes of the trade other than for offices'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has already explained the nature of the amendments, all I can do is to beg formally to move Amendment No. 410, in page 29, line 15, leave out 'purposes of the trade' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or commercial purposes of the trade other than for offices'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is some difficulty because the Minister has not had an opportunity to follow the purpose of the amendments. If the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) would elucidate, the Minister might indicate whether he is prepared to consider them on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you for your assistance, Mr. Crawshaw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first of the related amendments that we discussed during our last sitting, which I think was Amendment No. 123, had linked with it a series of consequential amendments. As one would expect with an amendment drafted by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), it carried with it all the proper consequential amendments, which were, I think, Nos. 123 to 127. We discussed them altogether and they were withdrawn when we moved on to discuss Amendments Nos. 170 and 171, which did not have attached to them the consequentials that should have been attached, as had the earlier amendment drafted by my right hon. Friend. This amendment attempts to put right that omission, for which I apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I have caused some confusion, but these amendments are consequential upon the Government's defeat in Committee last week, and, of course, the amendments moved last week, having been accepted by the Committee, would have had these amendments attached to them, as it were, to ensure that they were carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could say something about the Opposition amendment which was carried last week. Since the Committee decided in that way, we are looking again, but without prejudice, at the arguments put. We are looking at them with an open mind to see whether it is possible to give some expression to the will of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1132">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1047</span>
Committee. But I want to make it quite clear that it is not a commitment: we have not changed our mind. However, in all fairness to the Committee, since it decided in the way it did, we should look at the argument again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot say much more until Report stage, but, having informed the Committee of that, perhaps the Opposition will consider that it is not necessary to press these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is necessary to press these amendments. I trust that the Government will not divide against them. It makes nonsense of the Bill if one does not bring in the consequential amendments. Of course, the Government have a right to reconsider the whole matter and steamroll them out on Report. However, I trust they will not do so but will accept what the Committee has decided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Opposition are defeated on an amendment we frequently say that we will think again about it and bring back something on Report, which might be acceptable on the Floor of the House but which is not acceptable to the Committee. Therefore, the Government have a perfect right to say "We will look at this again. We do not necessarily accept it at this stage." But it would make a nonsense of the Bill if the consequential amendments were voted out. Therefore, I would ask the Committee to give a positive vote to insert them in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee for this batch of amendments. I took steps yesterday to try to inform hon. Gentlemen opposite of their purport so that they would not have to study them afresh this morning. I apologise if the notice was rather short. However, I hope for the future that it will be possible to give more notice of Government amendments. But I am sure right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite appreciate
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1052</span>
that very often this is difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I propose to deal first with Amendment No. 359 and then with Amendment No. 362 and New Clause 11. I shall then deal with Amendments Nos. 361 and 360 together with the batch of Amendments Nos. 363 to 366, and finally say something about New Clause 6. That is the logical order in which to deal with them because one amendment obviously leads on to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 359 modifies Clause 19(1) to extend the range of disposals which do not trigger off an industrial deferment. Clause 19(1) as presently drafted disregards deemed disposals and intra-group disposals which are dealt with in Clause 20(1). The amendment adds to this list—so that it is a further exemption from the tax or a further deferment of tax—disposals in the course of amalgamations and reconstructions. I will deal with that aspect more fully on New Clause 11. Therefore, the amendment deals first with amalgamations and reconstructions and extends the present proposals for deferral to them, and also with the disposals which form part of a sale and lease back transaction. Again, I shall deal in greater depth with that aspect on Amendment No. 362.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Second Reading we gave an assurance that we would amend the Bill and deal with sale and lease back transactions. This is a fairly normal way of financing industrial and commercial developments, and we felt that it would not be right that a device—and I am not using the word in any perjorative sense—to enable industrial companies to raise finance should be charged to development land tax merely because this was a form of financing, and nothing more, and so Amendment No. 362 will deal with that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to Amendment No. 362, which defines the circumstances in which a disposal is regarded as forming part of a sale and lease back transaction, and makes consequential amendments to fit a sale and lease back into the general provisions about triggering deferred liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection 6(A) of the amendment defines a disposal forming part of a sale and lease back transaction as a disposal of the owner's interest in the whole or part of the land in which it subsists in return for a grant of a lease in the whole or part of that land. It is, therefore, apt
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1135">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1053</span>
to cover, not only the case where the owner disposes of his freehold interest in the whole or part of his land in return for a lease, but also where he has a lease and disposes of it in return for a sub-lease. As hon. Gentlemen will appreciate, that kind of case would occur where, in fact, the owner has a lease and grants a sublease to the financial institution that is to lend the money. I hope that that subsection will cover that situation also.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection 6(B) provides that if the lease is subsequently disposed of the appropriate part of the deferred liability will be triggered of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection 6(C) provides that if the disposal forming part of the sale and lease back transaction extends to only part of the interest in land a subsequent disposal of that retained interest is treated as if it were a corresponding part disposal of the original interest in land—that is, the interest in land held when the industrial development was commenced. As I said, this amendment, taken with the previous amendment, fulfills a promise we made on Second Reading, after consultations, that we would deal with the sale and lease back situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to New Clause 11, which is concerned with amalgamations and reconstructions, and, again, is to introduce a relieving provision in the sense of a deferral of tax in regard to amalgamations and reconstructions. The clause ensures that a disposal of an interest in land during the course of certain company reconstructions and amalgamations does not give rise to a DLT liability. The situation with which the new clause is intended to deal is where, as part of a scheme of reconstruction or amalgamation, one company takes over the whole or part of the business of another company, that other company receiving no consideration for the transfer of the business except by at the same time transferring the business liabilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consideration for the transfer takes the form of shares in the first company issued direct to the shareholders in the second. In other cases the consideration may go to the liquidator of the second company for distribution to its members. The new clause deals similarly with disposals during the course of the amalgamation of two or more registered industrial and provident societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 359 provides that neither sort of disposal will trigger off any
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1054</span>
industrial deferment and Amendment No. 361 provides that company reconstructions or amalgamations will not trigger off any statutory undertaking deferment. The provisions about disposals during the course of company reconstructions or amalgamations parallel those for capital gains purposes. They are not very different from the capital gains tax provisions on amalgamations and reconstructions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 267 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, which is a corresponding capital gains tax provision provides for such a disposal to be treated as being made on a "no gain, no loss" basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions about disposals during the course of the amalgamation of two or more registered industrial and provident societies also parallel those for capital gains tax purposes, which also treat these as "no gain, no loss" disposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 6 has been put down by some of my hon. Friends to deal with the problems of registered industrial provident societies, again in the course of amalgamation. This point was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mr. Tomlinson), and I promised to look at it. I can assure my hon. Friends that in New Clause 11 we have been able to meet the point which they have raised in tabling New Clause 6. I hope that they will feel that we have gone all the way to meeting this point regarding the amalgamation of registered industrial and provident societies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand correctly, New Clause 11, although it includes industrial and provident societies, is in no way restricted and is a very general clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Gentleman said, is not confined to industrial provident societies; it deals with companies in general, but it is necessary to extend the provision to deal with industrial and provident societies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 361 amends Clause 22 and it follows consequentially on the other amendments and the new clause. Amendment No. 361 modifies Clause 22(1) to extend the range of disposals which do not trigger off a statutory undertakers deferment. Clause 22(1) as drafted disregards these disposals. The amendment provides for disposals falling under Clause 20(1)—inter-group disposals—and disposals in the course of amalgamations and reconstructions also be be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The disregard of intra-group disposals brings the statutory undertakers deferment into line with the industrial deferment. Clause 22 deals with statutory undertakers, and this amendment seeks to bring them into line with the normal industrial deferment provided by Clause 19. This had not originally been provided for because it was thought that intra-group disposals were unlikely to occur in this field, that is, in the case of statutory undertakers which are different from normal industrial companies. However, it is possible for them to happen, and so it is appropriate to ensure that the deferred liability is not triggered in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 360 is purely a drafting amendment. It alters the wording of Clause 20(3)(	<i>a</i>) to make it clear to the reader that the assumption about the chargeable person's date of acquisition is made only for the purposes of Clause 5(5) and, subject to paragraph (	<i>c</i>), to Clause 6. This form of wording is also used in subsection (7)(	<i>a</i>) of New Clause 11. This is a drafting amendment consequential on the other amendments and the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come now to Amendments No. 363, 367, 368, 369, 370, 364, 365 and 366. These are drafting improvements and in part consequential upon Amendments Nos. 359 and 361 and New Clause 11, which makes special provision for sale and lease back transactions, amalgamations and reconstructions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would be quite happy to read through to show the special effects of these amendments, but I assure the Committee that they are consequential and do not change
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1056</span>
the substance in any way and perhaps the Committee feel it unnecessary to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That deals with all the amendments and new clauses. I come to New Clause 6 in the names of my hon. Friends the Members for Aberdare (Mr. Evans), Dartford (Mr. Irving) and Farnworth (Mr. Roper), which appears to meet the point of the amalgamation of industrial provident societies. We met this point in New Clause 11 in the complete way in which they would have desired, and for that reason I think it unnecessary for New Clause 6 to be incorporated in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the inclusion of these amendments even if, as the Minister says, some are complicated. We thank him for his explanation which was very helpful, and for which we are grateful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is only one point I should like to raise on Amendment No. 362. Apart from the welcome to the inclusion of this group of amendments, particularly as they are a recognition of the importance of the value of property as the asset which is used by one means or another, so often by industry and commerce, as the means for financing investment in expansion plans, it is not always by means of a scale on this pattern. It commonly is used as security for some form of loan, a bank loan or in some cases a debenture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Amendment No. 362, the subsequent disposal of the lease which is granted can trigger off the deferred tax. Would the Minister consider the problems that could arise fairly frequently, namely, the surrender of the existing lease and the grant of a new lease for a longer term to the original owner and the continuing occupier?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite common, particularly in industry, where perhaps the original lease was for 21 years or similar period, such as 20 years and five-year reviews, for the original vendor and present occupier of the premises to be considering an expansion or the installation of expensive machinery. He may wish to surrender the present lease and take on a longer one so that he has the premises for a sufficient period to justify going ahead with the investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, he may wish to surrender his existing lease and take a new one. Does the wording of the clause prevent the deferred tax from being triggered off by that action? If it were,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1137">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1057</span>
we should change the wording to cover the continued occupation under a lease granted in succession to a previous lease and make sure that that continues to carry the deferment with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for having incorporated in New Clause 11 a certain number of points which my hon. Friends and I tabled in New Clause 6, referring to the transfer of engagements in industrial and provident societies. As he suggested when moving this and associated amendments, this is not an easy matter to follow. I have attempted to ascertain whether all of the points we had incorporated in New Clause 6 are included within his proposals in New Clause 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little concerned about the reference to Clause 16 which was in New Clause 6 in subsection (4) and which does not appear to be incorporated in his New Clause 11, although it may be covered by his reference to subsections (4) and (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for tabling the amendment, and if we find some 	<i>lacunae</i> between his New Clause 11 and New Clause 6 we can return to this matter on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two points I should like the Minister to clarify. The first relates to Amendment No. 360. Will the clause, in its amended form with Amendment No. 360 incorporated, still ensure that special addition is preserved in all cases of 	<i>bona fide</i> transfers within a group of companies? I hope the Minister can confirm that that is so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point relates to Clause 22 and the situation of statutory undertakers. I welcome these amendments because they could apply to Letchworth Garden City Corporation. The constitution of some of the less usual statutory undertakers might well lead them into situations where they should be given the same arrangements as otherwise apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend has just asked me whether a statutory undertaker, as a result of these amendments, would be in a position to make sale and lease back arrangements. Although that might seem improbable, it is not impossible, and in future it might be a useful means of raising finance for one of the statutory undertakers of the kind that I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1058</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal with some of those points?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point raised by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) was the case where there might be a surrender of a lease by the occupier, as he put it, and a reacquisition of a new, longer lease. As I read the clause, that surrender would be a disposal. Whether one surrenders for money or for another lease, one is surrendering a lease. As the clause is drafted, my immediate reaction would be that that would be a disposal. Whether this would create a problem, I do not know. I take it from what he said that he is afraid that it might. For that reason, we are prepared to look at the situation to see whether we are doing anything which might inhibit a form of financing. At the moment, I cannot say more than that. We will look at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) referred to New Clause 6 and asked whether in fact the two are identical. My understanding and advice is that they are substantially the same, but again I will check on that and if there are any points of difference I will let my hon. Friend know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about Amendment No. 360, which is a drafting amendment and does not affect special addition in any way. It is purely an amendment to improve the drafting of the legislation and has no bearing, and is not intended to have any bearing, on any substantive charge to tax or any exemption for special addition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. I wonder whether, through you, I could ask the Minister whether it would be in order for me to put the voice for all the Government amendments in future?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 249, in page 29, line 18, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the tax so deferred shall not exceed the tax which would be payable if the project of material development had not been begun".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Amendment No. 250, in page 29, line 18, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that in calculating the liability to tax which has been deferred any expenditure on relevant improvements or as the case may be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1138">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1059</span>
improvements incurred after the project of material development has begun shall be taken into account".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4(1) states that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the realised development value accruing to a person on the disposal by him of an interest in land shall be the amount (if any) by which the net proceeds of the disposal exceed the relevant base value of that interest."</p></blockquote>
It occurs to us that the intention of these deferment provisions should be that the tax paid, if on a subsequent event the tax becomes payable, should be the same as the tax that would have been paid if there had been no deferment eligibility on the occasion of the original disposal. There are circumstances in which one could envisage the tax paid being somewhat different as the difference between the base price, which still remains the base price and is one which might go back some years, and the price on the occasion of disposal could be very substantial. On the other side, there is the problem where an industrial building might be erected. Industrial buildings tend to have a shorter lifespan than other types of building. Therefore, this being a depreciating asset, the asset eventually disposed of, as regards the building, might not have much value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be able to tell us that these amendments are unnecessary and that on no occasion could the tax payable be different from the tax that would have been payable on the original occasion which led to the deferment. If that is so, I am sure that we should be happy to withdraw the amendment, but I think that there is a point here which needs to be looked at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman' has raised an important point. He asked me to say that the amendments may be unnecessary, but I cannot tell him that. The amendments seek to go a long way towards recomputing the tax charge on the deemed disposal. In other words, the amendments say that if, at the end of the day, when the disposal takes place the tax that would have been payable would have been less than was payable as a result of the deemed disposal on the commencement of material development, then less tax should be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the corollary also operates. If the amendment seeks to proceed on the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1060</span>
basis of not treating the deemed disposal as a final and conclusive disposal for tax purposes but seeks to look at it again in terms of hindsight or what the position would be on an actual disposal, the corollary must be that, if there is more tax to be paid at the point of disposal, more tax should be paid. I suggest that the hon. Member cannot have it both ways. If he seeks to reduce the tax burden on the actual disposal, he must also concede that, in all fairness, if he is arguing from the point of view of fairness, tax should be increased if that was the position at the actual disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These points have been made to us, especially by the House-Builders Federation, but I understand that when the point about fairness and consistency was put to the Federation, when it was pointed out that to accept these amendments would also lead to accepting a situation where there could be increased tax at the point of disposal, I believe that its enthusiasm for this change was not as great as it was initially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has to accept—I know that the Opposition do not accept this—within the Bill that a deemed disposal triggers off liability, and liability is decided at that point of time. What happens afterwards is really irrelevant from this point of view, because the charge arises after commencement of material development, and the difference between current use value and realised development value is the tax charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In between that point of time and further sale there may be an increase in development value, there may not be, but that is a new situation which will be dealt with at the point of disposal. For that reason, I cannot agree with these amendments and seek to recompute, as it were, by reference to what happens afterwards, the charge that arises on the commencement of material development. If we have to recompute, we have to recompute upwards as well as downwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has raised a problem of ups and downs, which needs to be considered. I should like to study carefully what he has said and consult those who have made representations to us on this issue to see whether we agree with his interpretation of fairness with regard to accepting both the increases and decreases in taxation. In the meantime, reserving one's position—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1139">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1061</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend does what I think he is about to do, I point out that the problem which arises here and about which I am not entirely clear is that, under Clause 19, tax which would otherwise be immediately payable is deferred. As the Minister said, it is only the tax that is deferred, not the calculation of the amount on which it is to be paid. The deemed disposal is still there, though the project of material development has begun and the tax is assessed then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does it boil down to this, that the industrialist—or, now, the commercial man—who extends on his own property for his own use is assessed for tax, then the payment of it is deferred, and if he then disposes of that property for purposes other than his own trade, he will be liable to a second bout of tax? In the meantime, of course, if he makes improvements, he can take into account those improvements made between the deemed disposal, the tax on which is deferred, and the actual disposal, the tax on which is then calculated again, so that he is paying two lots of tax. Is that the position, because that seemed to be what the Minister was saying?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the first point we have a deemed disposal. The industrialist—and a commercial company, following the amendments which have been made in Committee—will not pay any tax at that point of deemed disposal, but his tax liability may well be computed at that time. It will certainly be computed by reference to that time. Whether the Revenue does the computation at that point is another matter. In practice, it might be undesirable to go through the work at that point. Be that as it may, however, it will be calculated by reference to what happens at that point in time and to the valuations at that point in time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If he sells the property later on, or ceases completely industrial use, that triggers off the tax liability as computed by reference to the moment of the deemed disposal. He pays his tax at that point in relation to that deemed disposal. Between the period of deemed disposal and the period of actual disposal, something may or may not have happened. There may have been no increase at all in what is now the current use value of the land, the development value of the land becoming, as it were, the current use value after the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1062</span>
deemed disposal. There may be no increase in development value between the deemed disposal and the sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the case, no tax will be payable on the sale because there will be no development value on which to pay the tax. However, there may be an increase in development value between deemed disposal and sale, but that is an entirely different situation. If there is such an increase, tax will be paid on the increase between the deemed disposal and the sale. That would probably be a less likely situation in most cases, but if it were the case tax would be payable. So the hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that he may have to pay two lots of tax, but not on the same development value, only on the increase in development value over and above the development value on which he was taxed at the moment of deemed disposal. He would pay the extra tax on that increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for improvements, if there has been no increase in development value, or if the current use value remains the same between the deemed disposal and the actual disposal, there is no question of allowing or disallowing improvements because there will be no development land tax to be paid. If on the other hand there has been an increase in the development value between deemed disposal and actual disposal, and if there have been relevant improvements, these will enter into the computations for paying the tax on the second disposal or the second situation. But there is no question of taxing him twice on the same development value or denying him deduction for improvements where there is a tax payable on development value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his clear explanation. I suppose it would be asking too much that if the development value turned out as a negative as between the deemed disposal and the actual disposal this could be taken account against the tax payable on the deemed disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have always assumed that Clause 19 was in effect the Government's replacement for the first lettings charge which they are abolishing. I had always assumed that this was some alternative to that. Otherwise, I can see no reason why they should want to attempt to have deemed disposal procedure in this case
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1140">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1063</span>
at all. It is beyond my comprehension why they should want to do so. The Minister looks puzzled. I appreciate that it is not the same as the first lettings charge. We are concerned with the taxation of an entirely notional gain in this circumstance—a circumstance where the tax will only in fact be levied when the gain is realised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that it would be far better if they had done away with the deemed disposal procedure altogether in these circumstances and said that the tax should be levied only when an asset of this sort is disposed of and in no other circumstances. I see no reason why there should be all these residual valuations and deemed disposal procedures in the circumstances envisaged in Clause 19. It seems to me to be a complete waste of time and money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) is quite right in saying that the whole of Clause 19—and we have in fact spent quite a long time discussing this in the context of the amendments—is a consequential of the deemed disposal measures which, if we were starting all over again, might certainly make me think again as to the merits of deemed disposal, particularly when we are dealing with trade, which it might have been easier to exclude altogether from the deemed disposal provisions. However, we are saddled with it. I think that we have slightly improved it, indeed rather considerably improved it, in the course of our discussions on the clause. The Government amendments have also helped, of course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the Minister's remarks on the second lot of development value, presumably the important point here is that the current use value after the first deemed disposal takes into account the permission for industrial use or whatever it is. Development value would have to be a further change from that. Therefore, in normal circumstances, I hope that there would not be a second lot of tax payable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with those two points. In most cases I should not have thought that there would be any tax chargeable on the actual disposal because the planning permission element would have gone into the current use value as the result of a deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1064</span>
The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) raised the question of deemed disposal in Clause 91. I assure him that Clause 19 is not our answer to first letting. Throughout the Bill there is a charge on deemed disposals, subject now to the amendments that have been moved. But the principle of the Bill is to charge development land tax at the point of deemed disposal. Honourable Gentlemen opposite have criticised this, but we think it is right to keep it in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 19 as drafted excludes an industrialist from the charge on deemed disposal where he develops for his own use. It defers the charge until he disposes of the property or where he positively ceases the industrial use. This is an attempt to assist industrialists in that situation. However, the principle of deemed disposal remains in the legislation, and we think that it should so remain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Although Amendment No. 201 raises a separate and rather important point, namely, that the ancillary processes. which we believe should be included in the clause, are not necessarily carried out within the same curtilage if one is using that term in the normal way that it is understood in the property world, I am reminded of one example which I used to see fairly frequently at the Cowley Works, Oxford, where the bypass goes between two parts of the same large works. I am not sure whether it is a factory on both sides, or a factory on one side and a warehouse on the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is perhaps an extreme example of ancillary processing being carried out outside the same curtilage but being equally ancillary to. I am sure that many Members of the Committee will be familiar with cases where some part of an operation of an industrial or commercial process is carried on on the other side of the road from the principal activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recollect, if he has driven up Tottenham Court Road during the past few years, that when Maples were rebuilding and took their shop round the corner—indeed, this clause will now apply to commercial premises—they had a notice up saying "Maples have gone round the bend."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good example, for which I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. Sometimes those of us associated with commerce find that such activities are sufficient to send one round the bend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, one would not wish something to be included merely because it was not technically within the same curtilage. I suspect that amendments previously discussed make this much easier. If it is merely the warehousing operation which is on another curtilage, it is now included in its own right. On reconsideration it may be that as the clause now stands, we may not need this particular amendment. But if by any mischance there were further amendments at a later stage, this is an important point to be taken into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments follow on the debates that were taking place on Thursday of last week.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall need to look at some of them with great care, and in particular how far we extend the deferment of development land tax for those forms of land use which go beyond the plain industrial test. Whether we accede to that test, or whether in the consideration we extend it much wider, one can draw the dividing line for the following reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Bill was first drafted the need was recognised to give certain advantages to industry. Manufacturing industry has been subject to a number of problems for many years, and clearly anything which added to those problems could not be considered. But when hon. Gentlemen think of extending the provisions to storage, although that is the subject of further consideration, I must show that distinction can be made. I shall show this by reference to my own constituency, because I think it is an example that can be echoed by many hon. Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall a former town clerk who once said he could use up all his vacant new premises and factories by means of making them available for storage purposes. His difficulty was that any such factories used for storage would not increase the number of jobs that was required, and it would prevent a number of extra opportunity for employment coming into the area. In his own local way, he was drawing the kind of distinction that the drafters of the Bill had in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mention this only because hon. Members opposite have the same aim in mind—namely, the need to improve industrial prospects. I refer again to storage. Although storage for industrial purposes is an essential part of an operation, nevertheless we must remember that storage on its own can involve storage of imported goods, without any industrial test at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one looks at the extension of storage, one sees that in many cases the connection between such storage and industrial purposes can be tenuous or non-existent. I mention that only to bring in some of the background. I did not have the opportunity to attend last Thursday's debates, but my hon. Friend has given an undertaking that there will be a further examination of the point to attempt to meet some
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1142">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1067</span>
of the points raised. But however far one takes this examination, one is left with the problem of offices, which has always been regarded as separate. I hope that that distinction will always be maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) gave a very interesting example involving a case where a road cuts right through a factory. We have had many such examples—perhaps of a kind less dramatic than the hon. Gentleman gave but, nevertheless, equally valid. I would advise him that a curtilage is not necessarily cut by a road, although I take fully the point that he makes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is not much more that I can say in view of the commitment given to examine the matter. It will obviously be one of the important matters for further debate on Report. If the hon. Gentleman has any further questions, I shall be happy to answer them. Perhaps after that he may wish to ask leave to withdraw the amendment, because of the way in which it has been treated both by myself and the Minister of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am naturally sorry that the Financial Secretary was not able to be present during our debate last Thursday, particularly in view of his remarks on offices. Had he been present, he might have supported me against the Minister of State, who seemed to be rather scathing about some of the wording in the amendment on this point. This will make interesting reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two important points emerge from the remarks of the Financial Secretary. The first is the need for us all to bear in mind that entirely artificial distinctions tend to creep in when we say "That is warehousing" and "This is industry".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apart from the obvious storage of the components needed for an industrial process or storage of the finished product—which, incidentally, is specially helped by the Government in order that production can be kept up—there are funds available to help industrialists store the end product if the market is temporarily depressed. Steel is the most obvious example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a horrifying example of SET. If we take as an example a product going to the consumer, if the storage of the end product was directly linked in with the factories, then work in such a warehouse
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1068</span>
qualified for a premium. If that job were done independently by a wholesale distributor, it was neutral. If done by the wretched, much-abused retailer, it then became subject to a penalty. Yet they were all doing the same job. Efficient distribution is vital to industry, and warehousing and storage is part of efficient distribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take the point regarding jobs, which I appreciate is something that sometimes worries town clerks and others. In my experience a warehouse which has a large illuminated sign saying "J. Sainsbury Limited" at Basingstoke, for instance, has a higher employment per hundred square metres than practically any other large factory in that town. Some warehouses have a relatively high employment factor, because it depends on the nature of the warehousing taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If warehousing is associated with retail distribution, for example, where goods are coming in, being broken down from bulk and then despatched to retail outlets, one is likely to have a high level of employment. But if it is virtually dead storage, employment can be relatively low. Of course, the same building can be used for one purpose during one part of the year and for another purpose during the other part of the year. Therefore, one runs into a considerable complication when one tries to differentiate between different types of warehousing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, if we are to return to this particular matter on Report, with perhaps Government amendments being worded slightly differently from those which the Committee has accepted, it would be helpful to us all to have some reasonable notice of the nature of these amendments. Obviously, they are consequential and would need to be looked at very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Warehouses and storage premises have always been the enemies of town planners. They have always been the enemies of the taxman. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) mentioned the terrible complications of SET. However I should like to put in a favourable word for warehousing and the good job that it has done in many places where improvements in development were required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, let us take cotton mills in Lancashire. If people who needed warehousing space had not taken over those mills, and improved them in many cases,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1143">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1069</span>
we should have had derelict premises in my area. However, there is some distinction between the sort of warehousing that my hon. Friend the Member for Hove mentioned as being part and parcel of retail distribution, or part and parcel of the manufacturer's business—for example, the man who stores his goods as they are manufactured and keeps a reserve for the market—and pure warehousing of, say, Littlewoods Mail Order stores or Green Shield Stamps where goods are merely stored, and are not necessarily within the process of manufacture, or even what we call the straight retail trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, both the planners and the Inland Revenue have tried to make a false distinction between manufacturing, retailing, wholesaling and the sort of Cinderella of it all—namely, the warehouseman or the storagemen, as if he is someone who should be shunned, a sort of leper in the trade. He does not fit in with the town planners' schemes and he does not fit in with the taxman's schemes. I think he does fit in. He has done a great deal in the planning sphere, where no one else could have saved some of the dereliction—and particularly I am thinking of my own constituency in Lancashire—and the manufacturer, the wholesaler and retailer, could not do without the warehouse. Let us, therefore, get away from the labelling of the warehouseman as the Cinderella of industry and commerce.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon.

The CBI was clearly concerned that there could be vital storage premises where the order for export was accumulated, so to speak, but which would be disqualified by the clause as originally worded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may stretch your discretion, Mr. Crawshaw, I think that exactly the same point will apply to the next amendment in that, as we now have the clause, this is a not unnecessary amendment. I do not want to delay the Committee by repeating the same arguments on each of these points, but the presence of these amendments on the Amendment Paper and their source—the CBI—reinforces the point that my right hon. Friend and I have made on the significance of these and other activities to the overall industrial process.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 202, in page 30, leave out lines 8 to 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment effectively deletes the whole of subsections (5) and (6). It is a probing amendment, on a point that has been put again by the CBI concerning the problem that would occur when an industrial building, which had been erected for a limited period, had served its purpose and would normally be demolished or its use changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it has already been remarked in our debates that it is more likely to happen in industry than in other occupations that one might erect a building to house equipment needed for a limited period, or to be tried out and moved to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1144">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1071</span>
another position and integrated more fully with the overall industrial process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, when the need for the building has expired and the building may very well be left standing empty, does one have the situation where one may keep one man working one hour a week in the building on something which could constitute an industrial process in order to prevent the triggering off of development land tax charge on a charge of use?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point may not be relevant. I hope the Minister will say that it is. But obviously industry cannot get the entire benefit of the deferment of liability that is included in the clause if a contingent liability is always to be included in a company's accounts for tax which could become payable because a building had to be demolished. At that time, the company would not have the opportunity of realising the value of land. They would have demolished the building, thereby triggering off the tax and obtained no other benefits. In these circumstances, obviously those lending money to the company, or providing debenture money which is secured on property, would be concerned that the liability would undermine the asset value, in which case the company would find it more difficult to borrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This point needs to be looked at. In the industrial situation the deferred charge could be triggered off almost inadvertently by events which would be regarded as perfectly normal in industry—change of use of a building which was erected for a temporary period, or being demolished and replaced by another building, again probably for the industrial process or, perhaps, for a temporary period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it needs to be considered whether the clause, as worded, diminishes the benefit to industry of the relief which the clause is intended to provide by raising an uncertain contingent liability from the carrying out of normal industrial activities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that can reassure the hon. Gentleman. I appreciate that representations have been made, especially by the CBI, in particular in relation to the demolition of a building, which he instanced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I try to set out what triggers the deferred charge to tax? In order for the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1072</span>
deferred charge to be triggered, it is necessary for the owner to cease to carry on the trade completely. In other words, there must be a cessation of the trade; or he must have established a non-qualifying use for the building in question. Subsection (6) explains that for a non-qualifying use to be established the property must be used for non-industrial purposes for at least half of a continuous two-year period. This provides a fair marging for permitting temporary or intermittent non-industrial uses without the tax being triggered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be something positive to trigger the tax, that is, a cessation of the trade itself. The trade can come to an end for many reasons. If there is a cessation of the trade, the charge is triggered; or, if we are considering a building, if there is a positive non-industrial use, and that non-industrial use has been established within the provisions of subsection (6) for some time. The demolition of a building as such would not, I should have thought—though there may be an extreme case—trigger off a charge. Demolition of a building in itself would not be a cessation of the trade. It might be part of the cessation of the trade, but if the trade comes to an end the company could not complain overmuch, I should have thought.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is concerned about the situation where trade continues and a building is demolished. If trade is continuing and a building is demolished, demolition of the building does not bring the industrialist within the first limb. There is no cessation of a trade and therefore the trigger does not operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, we have to look at the other condition—non-qualifying use. Again, I should have thought that if a building were demolished there was no positive non-qualifying use taken on, because the building has gone and that is the end of it. Therefore, in the overwhelming majority of cases, this fear is rather unfounded because demolition in itself would not trigger off the charge, either because it does not create the cessation or because demolition does not lead to a positive non-industrial use in relation to that building anyway, although it may in other matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that reassures the hon. Gentleman. We need something positive. If a trade comes to an end, that triggers off a situation, and we think that it is fair
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1145">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1073</span>
within the context of the legislation. A building is used for non-qualifying purposes for some time; that, again, triggers off the charge and of course, if the amendments were to apply, the problem would perhaps not be so great. We had to look at non-qualifying use again, but, taking the clause as it stands, there would have to be some positive non-qualifying use before the charge would be triggered off. I think that the CBI's fears are unfounded, because demolition would not trigger off any charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what the Minister said, but I think it is clear that he is trying to meet the point put by the CBI. On the point involving the cessation of trade, if a building is put on a site on the other side of the road, and if then after five or six years it is knocked down pending a further industrial warehousing occupation of the site, and the trade continues under the rest of the operation, there will not have been a cessation of trade on the site with which we are concerned—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He will notice that the clause states: that the non-qualifying use is established for
	<br><blockquote><p>"the building or other land or part thereof."</p></blockquote>
I am a little puzzled whether that means on some other part of land affected by subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that intervention. That is a problem on the non-qualifying use. We have certainly made it very much less of a problem because of the existence of the amendments which the Committee has already accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems likely that the most likely non-qualifying use with which we are now concerned, relates to cases where premises are still used for industrial purposes but used by another concern which is not part of the company or group of companies. The firm might decide to let off the premises which were previously being used for its own purposes because they were no longer required, and might merely have a landlord's interest in that site. I think that would constitute a non-qualifying use because it would bring the premises outside the provisions of this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point my right hon. Friend has made is important. It is not uncommon
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1074</span>
in an industrial estate that one substantial occupier of premises develops land held for expansion, gains his exemption under the clause, and that a relatively small building then becomes surplus to his own requirements. A neighbouring industrialist then says, "You are not using Shed A. Can I rent it from you because my export business is doing very well and I could use it for my purposes?" The other industrialist is delighted and says "Yes, I will lend you Shed A," which might be half a mile away from the site about which we are concerned. Would not that non-qualifying use trigger off the whole thing in relation to the original building which was the expansion carried out by the industrialist? The wording of subsection (6) is a little peculiar in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman have raised the matter of the wording of subsection (6). I did not read that subsection as creating half as much difficulty as they suggest. I read "building" as being mutually exclusive from other land. We are concerned with the non-qualifying use for any
	<br><blockquote><p>"building or other land or part thereof".</p></blockquote>
We are concerned here with a building. If there is a non-qualifying use for that building, the charge is triggered. If there is land involved, there may be non-qualifying use for that land or part of it, and again the charge is triggered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the example given by the hon. Gentleman, if the industrialist had a deferral of liability in respect of that particular shed, and the shed is then leased for a non-industrial purpose, a trigger would operate in relation to that particular piece of property, and not to other parts which still continue with industrial use. That is partly why subsection (6) is drafted in that way. We look at the physical item, as it were, be it building or land, and a trigger occurs if there is non-industrial use in relation to that particular physical item.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the wording needs to be looked at again. If there is a non-qualifying use established for a part of what I will call the exempt or deferred property, does that trigger off the mechanism for the whole? I do not think the words are very clear. I am sure that that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1146">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1075</span>
is not the intention, but it involves an apportionment of deferred tax. I presume that is what would happen if, for example, my hon. Friend's shed is only part of a very much larger factory for which the tax is deferred when that factory was developed and it is only in respect of that shed that the tax is triggered, and there would be some apportionment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that is the position and that the whole tax would not be triggered off by merely letting off one small portion of the area for a non-qualifying use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could deal with that last point. The right hon. Gentleman will know that Clause 26(4) deals with the apportionment point. The Board or, on appeal, the Commissioners can decide the apportionment. Some cases will be decided on appeal, but most cases will be decided by the inspector or by the people in Middlesbrough. There is provision for apportionment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The apportionment is provided for, as the Minister says. But I am still worried about the wording of the clause because I think we are as one in the intention. The Minister seems happy that it is only the building that will be taken into consideration but, as my right hon. Friend has said, subsection (6) does not give that impression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of what the Minister has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 413, in page 30, line 15, leave out 'purposes of the trade' and insert

	<br><blockquote><p>'without becoming used for the industrial purposes of another trade carried on by him'.</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment, and concerns a person who erects an industrial building and later ceases to carry on the original trade in that factory and who after a period of unoccupation, starts a new industrial process or trade from the same factory. I am concerned that the cessation of the first trade should not be
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1076</span>
held to trigger off the payment of the deferred tax merely because it was a change in manufacturing process. I hope that was not intended, but perhaps the Minister can reassure us on this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment will prevent triggering of deferred tax in the case where an owner ceases to use property for the purpose of the original trade and then uses it for industrial purposes of another trade carried on by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could be argued that although this type of case would not arise very often in practice, there is a danger that it might occur, I accept in principle the amendment and the points made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to reserve my position on the drafting, but the hon. Gentleman has my assurance that if he withdraws the amendment, I will bring forward an amendment on Report to meet the point he has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that undertaking. It is a point which needs to be covered, but in view of what he said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 251, in page 30, line 18, after 'trade', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'(except in circumstances where assuming an election under section 154(2) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 to have been duly made, the trade would not by virtue of section 154 (1) of that Act be treated as discontinued)'.</p></blockquote>
This again is by way of being a probing amendment to cover a situation where there has not been a change of trade but merely a change of partners in connection with a process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words that we seek to include go back to the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 and cover the circumstances which are recognised in that Act as not constituting a change or a discontinuance of an activity. It may be that the Minister will tell us that this is unnecessary or perhaps that it is necessary and he accepts it, or reserve the option, if it is necessary and he is not happy with the wording, that he will look at it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The substance of the amendment reflects a fear which The Law Society has expressed in relation to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1147">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1077</span>
partnerships. I will not go into the problems of partnerships in general; we shall deal with that on Clause 31. The amendment and the fear arise from a misunderstanding—I make no criticism of that because partnerships are complicated and difficult to deal with—of the way in which partnerships are treated in this legislation in regard to the cessation of trade. For income tax purposes, as the hon. Gentleman will know, whenever a partner retires, it is treated, for income tax purposes as the cessation of that trade and an election has to be made for income tax purposes to continue that trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not followed that pattern for development land tax, and in the context of development land tax there is no need for any special provision about whether the trade ceases if a partner retires. If it continues, it is treated as a trade of the partnership and the retirement or resignation by a partner does not mean a cessation of the trade, so there is no danger that a trigger will take place in relation to the partnership. A trigger may take place in relation to the share of the retiring partner. That does not really matter. The trade continues; it is not discontinued as happens for income tax. The trade goes on, and a change in the partnership does not involve a cessation of trading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the whole partnership is dissolved, that is cessation of the trade because the partnership carries on the trade. Or if the sole trader forms a partnership with another individual, then part of his trade is dissolved, there will be a trigger in relation to that particular part. But taking the partnership by itself, if there is no cessation on the resignation or retirement, the fears expressed in the amendment are unfounded. A partnership goes on, the trade goes on, and there is no trigger of liability in general, but if a partner retires there may be a trigger in respect of him and his share in the partnership.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 252, in page 30, line 18, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(not being a reversion to the former use of the land)'.</p></blockquote>
In considering this amendment in conjunction with Amendments Nos. 251 and 253, another point arises relating to a situation which might be relatively unusual, but which can still be envisaged, when land reverts to its original use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 19 appears fairly inept if deferred tax liability has occurred because of the development of a commercial or industrial building on land previously used for agricultural purposes. After a period, the trader or industrialist decides he no longer wishes to carry on that business, and demolishes the buildings and restores the land to agricultural use. It would seem to be inept because he would then have to pay the tax for having at one time used the land for industrial or commercial purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is relatively unlikely, but in the agriculture industry it is by no means impossible, particularly with the rather larger scale of industry with which we are now familiar.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a farmer deciding to get into an industrial process relating to his farming activities and use for some part of his agricultural holding, it could well be that if he decided to cease the industrial or commercial activity on that site he would find it most convenient to restore that land to agricultural use. In those circumstances, he—and I hope the Minister—will think it most inequitable that he should have to pay a deferred development land tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment, in part, follows from Amendment No. 202, where the concern, in the main, was the demolition of a building. The point is, what triggers off the charge to tax? I tried to explain in the course of that amendment that the tax is triggered off by cessation of the trade, or by positive non-qualifying use within the provisions of the clause. In this amendment, the hon. Gentleman seeks to prevent the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1148">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1079</span>
triggering when land reverts to its former use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see why we should, within the context of legislation, accept that that should not trigger the charge. If by reverting the land to its former use there is cessation of the trade, as indeed there probably would be in many cases because once the use of the land has ceased for that trade the trade might discontinue—it might not but in many cases it might—there would be a triggering off because the trade has ceased. In some cases the reversion of the land to its former use might not cause cessation of the trade, and might not bring us within non-qualifying purpose either. There could be an occasion where there would be no tax charge. In many cases, if there was a cessation of trade there would be tax charge, not necessarily because of the reversion to former use, but because the trade had ceased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman accepts the basis of Clause 19, which is that there should not be a liability where there is development for own use, one has to accept that if that own use ceases, or industrial use or commercial use ceases, the tax liability should be triggered. This is what we are trying to provide—that where the trade ceases then the benefits cease as well and tax should be chargeable. To single out reversion to former use is singling out one situation, but there may be many other situations. We think the tests in the clause are better as they say cessation of trade, on the one hand, or positive non-qualifying use, on the other. For those reasons, I cannot agree with this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope the Minister is prepared to think about this matter again. When my hon. Friend mentioned agriculture, I could foresee a number of circumstances in which exactly what he described might happen. Let us suppose that a farmer's land is becoming unprofitable and he decides to set up a small rural industry on part of his land. That does not seem an unreasonable or unlikely occurrence. Because he gets planning permission to erect a small building which will be used for industrial purposes, development land value might well accrue. A deemed disposal would take place, but there would be a deferment, under Clause 19, of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1080</span>
Then he decides eventually to sell the place to another farmer who wants to revert to using the building for chicken farming. This is something done indoors and is a perfectly normal procedure. In such circumstances, I see no reason why there should be a tax. If the chicken farm has reverted to an agricultural use, it may be said that this is a different form of farming from the grazing land which was there before, but it is still agriculture, and within the use of classes it is still in agricultural use. I should have thought that in such circumstances the point which my hon. Friend has made ought to be considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister would be prepared to look at this matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) for that support. As I have said, although this is not the most frequent of occurrences, it is something which one can envisage happening, particularly in the context of agriculture. As I am sure the Minister is aware, there are circumstances in which buildings used for industry fall back into agricultural use, and also circumstances in which buildings originally erected for agricultural purposes come into use for industry. The Minister said that this is only one situation among many others in which the tax could be triggered off. The purpose of the amendment is to identify the one situation among many others in which we believe that the tax should not be triggered off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said in my opening remarks, we believe that it would be inequitable that circumstances such as those described by my hon. Friend should trigger off the tax. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will think again about this. It may be only one situation, but I think it is the one situation which justifies an exception being made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may deal with the case of the farmer who sets up this splendid rural industry and works for years providing employment for the locality. Let us say that the farmer himself decides to revert to former use. Let us not complicate it with a sale to his neighbour or even the question of the barn or the chicken farm. If we accepted the hon. Gentleman's amendment, the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1149">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1081</span>
farmer who set up this splendid rural industry would not pay any development land tax at all, because the deemed disposal provisions would not apply. They would only apply if they were triggered off, but they would not be triggered off by the reversion to former use. So when he used the premises for farming again there would be no charge at all at any point, as I see it, for development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may say that that is a good thing, that it will benefit rural industry. We are back again to Clause 19 and the basic principles of this. I cannot see how there could be a tax charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is deliberately not using my example. He talked of not complicating the matter by referring to a sale to another farmer. But I deliberately complicated it by a sale to another farmer because that is exactly the circumstance in which the tax would accrue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are a number of different circumstances from time to time, and I know that there are farmers who are very well advised in these matters. I imagine that this would be a splendid loophole. It might be a good loophole, as I say, to set up rural factories. I can see that great use could be made of the amendment, and not perhaps in the worthy case that he mentioned. But he will appreciate that there are many different situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not putting that forward as the anly reason why I cannot accept the omendment, but it will indicate to him the problem. If one excludes one class of case in that way and says that it shall not trigger off the liability, where will there be a liability? The Opposition may say that there should be no charge on commencement of material development at all. That is their argument, which we do not accept, and I do not want to get into that one again. But once we are at the point of a charge on deemed disposal, and once we accept that there will be some relief for industrial and indeed commercial use, we have to provide at some point in time for the charge to be triggered off when that use ceases, whether on reversion to original use or for some other reason because the man gives up the trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Otherwise, not only would we have a loophole here but the whole basis of the legislation and the way in which we have framed it would be undermined. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1082</span>
Opposition may not mind that, but that is the reason why I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We seem to find loopholes in the most unexpected places.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Chicken farms!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there are chicken farms and various rural industries. Indeed, I believe that viticulture is now a rapidly expanding activity. I do not know how much wine is made in the Minister's constituency, but I gather that it is becoming a popular rural industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to look again at what the Minister has just said, as the situation seems to be getting potentially more and more complicated. The example mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), which involved the cessation of industrial activity and the sale of the farm, is an interesting one. Of course, the two events need not be simultaneous. The cessation of the activity may be followed after a period by the sale of the farm. What happens then? Is there a deferred tax which is then triggered off by the sale of the farm? and is that avoidable by the expiration of some given period? If it is not, it seems to me that we shall get a deferred liability locked in as a land charge which needs to be registered. Otherwise, long memories in the countryside would need to be used to remember that old Farmer Brown used that barn for an industrial process 30 years ago and there is therefore a deferred liability to DLT which will have to be paid because he has died and his widow is selling the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the Minister can answer that point. Is there a deferred liability which is triggered off when the farmer who has brought the industrial process back into an agricultural use in due course of time disposes of the farm?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is "Yes". When the industrial process comes to an end or when the industrial purpose ceases, the trigger takes place at that point in time, be it a farmer or anybody else. The exemption or deferral is for own use for industrial purposes, but according to the original clause if there is a cessation of the industry or trade and there are now amendments to widen that to commercial use, although whether

that would cover farming I do not really know—the liability is triggered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I return to what I said at the beginning.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 203, in page 30, line 35, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'and if the use follows damage to or loss of the buildings, the period may be extended during the period of re-instatement as appears to the Board or, on an appeal, to the Commissioners concerned to be just and reasonable'.</p></blockquote>
I hope that this amendment will find more sympathy with the Minister than the last. Here we are back to more conventional industry rather than rural industry. The amendment has been put to us by the CBI. It is not uncommon after the unhappy occurrence of an event such as a fire which puts a trader put of action that he may use the site for other purposes such as storage or even car parking prior to redevelopment. The length of time for which this other temporary use may continue will be dependent upon a number of circumstances, including, in some cases, factors such as the delivery of equipment needed for the restoration of the industrial purposes. Unfortunately, even relatively simple equipment can take a long time to deliver and some specialist items of equipment will be on delivery for years. One can envisage a large number of circumstances in which there would be an extended period of alternative use, prior to the restoration of the premises, to the original industrial use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, suggested by the CBI that there should be the right to appeal to</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1084</span>
	<p>that this may be a matter of considerable concern in the rural community. I therefore hope that if the Minister is unable to change his mind my right hon. and hon. Friends will support the amendment.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>the commissioners to extend the time during which the change of use would not trigger off the deferred tax.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to extend the period, the normal 12 months period after the two-year period, in respect of non-industrial or non-qualifying use. I think that the case he has in mind, mentioned by the CBI, is that where premises may be damaged by fire and for some time during redevelopment the property may be used, for instance, for car parking, the fear is that, by using the premises for car parking which might not be an industrial use, the 365 days are lost and the time ceases to run. So, by the time the industrialist uses the premises again for industrial purposes, that period in the middle may be treated as a non-qualifying purpose within Clause 19. The fear is that the industrialist could lose the benefit of the exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to give the Board and, on appeal to the commissioners, the power to decide that a longer time should be allowed where this is just and reasonable. The difficulty is, I suggest, that nobody knows on what criteria they are to decide, be it the Board or the commissioners, what is just and reasonable in the circumstances. At least, the time limit is fairly definite and although there may be hard cases on one side or the other, to ask the commissioners or the Board of Inland Revenue to decide what is just and reasonable in such a case would, I suggest, make it difficult for them to know what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1151">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1085</span>
would be just and reasonable and what length of time would be considered right in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that there could be a slight problem. We think that the way in which the clause is drafted would avoid these problems, as there has to be a positive showing or demonstration of non-industrial use. In most of these cases, there might not be a positive non-industrial use where premises were used temporarily while building was taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there might be one or two cases where this could happen, but I am not very happy with the way in which the amendment is drawn. I cannot see how one could improve it without a change in the time limit. But then, if it is increased, one runs into other difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to use the defence of the defeat of last week in every case, but if some way were found to meet the amendment of last week this difficulty might not disappear but could be lessened. I do not think there is a major problem here, but if the words were extended beyond "industrial" the problem would hardly arise. I am not happy about the amendment or the wording "just and reasonable". I accept that there might be a few cases where there is difficulty, but the vast majority would be covered, I should think, by the subsection, which is extremely flexible, because this requires a positive non-qualifying purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has again put his finger on the importance of the amendments which the Committee has already agreed. Were they not there in the earlier part of the clause, the events under the power would frequently trigger off the non-qualifying use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inclusion of the earlier amendment means that the non-qualifying use would almost certainly have to be used by another person on the premises temporarily, whilst the industrialist waited for the redevelopment to take place. I think, therefore, in view of the breakthrough we have made by the earlier amendments end the considerable diminution of the avents—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I suggest that, even if the House later accepts the previous amendments and they remain in the Bill,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1086</span>
it is still desirable that we should have an amendment such as is suggested, because if, for example, a block of shops was burned down and there were difficulties in obtaining planning permission for a new block to be built as the design was different, the non-qualifying use of the car park might be there for some time and might trigger off the tax in the circumstances described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse what my hon. Friend has said. I am not sure whether I am interrupting my hon. Friend the Member for Hove, or whether he has finished for the moment, but I should like to stress the point about planning. If premises are destroyed, whether by fire or flood, or even by the horrors of recent experience elsewhere by earthquake, or even by box girders and alumina cement from which there have been collapses, it will be very difficult to arrange for a quick rebuilding, particularly in getting new planning permission, although there are the tolerances for rebuilding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, under those circumstances, it is hardly likely that the owner of the property will use the premises himself even for the car park. He will let it to National Car Parks, or give it over to some other purpose by letting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make provision for this, whether it be by a longer time allowed or whether it be by putting the burden firmly on the shoulders of the owner to show that he has reason for not resuming his use of the premises for a period. I do not think my hon. Friend would mind that. The burden is thrown on to the owner to prove to the Board that he has good reason for delaying. I think that we must give some escape to those who have suffered disaster to their properties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was giving way to my hon. Friend the Member for Melton, and I am happy to give way as well on a continued basis to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby who has brought us back to the question of commercial uses. This amendment was originally suggested by the CBI, thinking purely in terms of industry. But the circumstance to which my right hon. Friend referred was one which I think is likely, a fire or something else which puts out of action most retail premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The planners may well decide, for good reasons, that they would like to take the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1152">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1087</span>
opportunity presented by the need to redevelop, to carry out a slightly larger scheme, or to see whether some other adjoining owner could be brought in to allow the scheme. That could give rise to a delay and, as things stand, the retail owner would be very reluctant to participate in any such scheme which would delay his rebuilding. Also, as my right hon. Friend pointed out, he could be reluctant to allow the temporary use of the premises for a car park, for example, but might want to let it to somebody, perhaps the local authority or National Car Parks to operate the car park while the rebuilding was delayed or outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the Minister being a little reluctant to allow more flexibility. He made it appear more difficult than it is because surely we can rely on the Board of Inland Revenue and the special commissioners to determine what is just and reasonable. As my right hon. Friend said, what is just and reasonable would presumably be a positive intention to rebuild and restore to previous use, which has been frustrated or delayed for reasons outside the control of, or which should reasonably be accepted by, the owner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The owner might be fighting a CPO over the property. What is the position then? It may take him three or four years to fight the local authority, which sees an opportunity to take over his property. Of course, if the compulsory purchase order were confirmed, it would be a triggering off for tax. But, supposing that he wins the fight, he will find himself having to pay the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend.

The phrase "beyond the control of the chargeable person" was used both by my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury). In the light of the Minister's comments, it would, perhaps, be worth considering the general points that have been made about this and approach it in a different way. One could perhaps build in an exception under Clause 19(6) to provide for some exclusion in the form of the words "except as a result of circumstances beyond the control of the chargeable person", provided that such person takes steps to restore the qualifying purpose for the building as soon as he is reasonably in a position to do so.

The other point that I should like to raise concerns the matter of insurance moneys. My hon.

I am not clear whether it is the Government's intention that for the purpose of Clause 19 if a building is damaged or burned down the part disposal under Clause 3 is triggered off and the company would only have to pay development land tax on insurance moneys which would be needed to reinstate the building.

The Minister has given a most sympathetic response in that case. Quite often, when Governments accidentally lose a Division, they simply say "We will restore it on the Floor of the House." The decision having been taken, I am heartened that the Government have said that they will look at this matter again. I genuinely believe that everything that has been said since has led to the conclusion that it was the original drafting of Clause 19 which was anomalous and that a re-drafting along the basis of the amendment carried by the Committee would be to the benefit of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been raised and I shall try to deal with them briefly. I again give the assurance, not only in relation to any consequences of last Thursday's defeat, but also in respect of other amendments, that we shall do out utmost to give right hon. and hon. Gentlemen sufficient time to consider them before Report. I agree that it is unfair that amendments should be tabled without right hon. and hon. Gentlemen having an opportunity to discuss them and put down amendments on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) has raised an important point concerning the receipt of insurance moneys and the question whether this is a disposal of the property for the purposes of Clause 19 so that in itself triggers off liability. I must confess that I do not know the answer to that question. We have dealt with insurance moneys and they can give rise in certain cases to a charge to development land tax. However, whether they trigger off a liability under Clause 19, I do not know. I will find out for the hon. Gentleman and let him know at the earliest possible opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have treated it as a part disposal when dealing with this particular aspect in paragraph 29 of Schedule 2. I would therefore assume from the fact that it can be a part disposal if insurance money is received that it is case which comes under a disposal because one is receiving money for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that we can let Clause 19 go by without giving sincere thanks to the Minister for the amendments which he has introduced and his explanation of a

	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 204, in page 31, line 3, after 'group', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'except where the disposal is to a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom of a non-resident member of the group'.</p></blockquote>
Clause 20 has the general purpose of disregarding transfers within a group for the purposes of development land tax. Subsection (2) gives cases which are exceptions to this, the first of which is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a disposal to a non-resident member of a group of companies by a resident member of the group".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to add the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"except where the disposal is to a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom of a non-resident member of the group."</p></blockquote>
The reason for tabling the amendment, which was suggested by the Confederation of British Industry, is that there should not be a difference between the permanent United Kingdom establishment of an overseas subsidiary of a United Kingdom company and a subsidiary in the United Kingdom of that overseas company. I hope that that is clear to hon. Gentlemen opposite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite normal where a United Kingdom company—let us call it company A—has an overseas subsidiary—company B—for Company B to have an operation in the United Kingdom distinct from its parent. It has premises which, for convenience sake, are likely to be adjacent to or even part of the premises used by company A. If company B is to turn the branch in the United Kingdom into a third company C, as a subsidiary of itself, then presumably company C would be treated as a resident member of the group, and a transfer between company A and company C would be treated as an inter-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1092</span>
group transfer and therefore development land tax would be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if it is only a branch, the transfer would fall foul of development land tax regulations. I give one practical example of the way in which this might catch a transaction which, I am sure, the Government do not wish to catch. The United Kingdom branch may act in the name of the overseas company, that is, company B, and in doing so, the transactions of that branch have behind them the full weight, authority and capital of the overseas company B. If, in order to avoid development land tax, company B then sets up a United Kingdom subsidiary—company C—we go into the whole business of having to get guarantees of the overseas company. The capital and standing of company C itself may be minor, and if the company concerned carries on financial or other transactions its creditworthiness, despite its parentage, might be less if it were a small incorporated company than if it were a branch of an overseas company directly inheriting all the assets and capital of company B overseas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to change the provision that transfers to non-residents do not receive some of the benefits which transfers to residents within a group receive under the legislation. As hon. Gentlemen know, under subsection (2), certain reliefs, which would be available where property is transferred between resident members of a group, are not available where that property is transferred from a resident member to a non-resident member, although, for the purposes of this legislation in general and subject to these exceptions, non-resident companies are treated as part of a group, unlike the capital gains tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman seeks to extend reliefs where the disposal is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom of a non-resident member of the group."</p></blockquote>
I am sorry to tell the hon. Gentleman that the difficulty arises because one does not dispose of property to a permanent establishment. One disposes of property to a company or an individual. A permanent establishment can be an office or a desk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As he may know, the term "permanent establishment" arises in double taxation agreements where it is sometimes necessary
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1155">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1093</span>
to find out how much profit or income arises. That is made by reference to the profit arising in respect of a permanent establishment which is defined in double taxation agreements as
	<br><blockquote><p>"a fixed place of business in which the business of the [non-resident] enterprise is wholly or partly carried on".</p></blockquote>
Thus, we are not concerned with a legal entity which can buy or sell land; we are concerned with a physical place. If it is to do that, I do not see how it is possible to have an amendment of this kind where property is disposed of to a permanent establishment because a permanent establishment cannot take titlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that does not sound like a legalistic argument, because it is not one. We have resident companies and non-resident companies. Non-resident companies may do business through the vehicle of a permanent establishment, but disposal has to be from the resident company to the non-resident company. Firms and establishments vary. The firm might be in a large office block in the City, or it might be a desk in the West End with a telephone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendment. The answer lies in the hands of the group. If there are difficulties, there is no reason why it should not form a resident subsidiary. There may be other reasons why it does not want to. I think we have gone as far as we can to give relief to non-resident companies, and I cannot recommend the Committee to extend further relief because I do not think it would work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Government think again about this matter in the light of practical examples?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Government must have some anti-avoidance provisions. There is no doubt about that, otherwise land could pass to and from with non-resident companies with tax havens, and so on. I can well understand the purpose of subsection (2)(	<i>a</i>) as at present drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My own company has overseas sub-sidiaries. Let us say that a building company has its head offices in Manchester. It decides that it wants to do business with the Common Market and it sets up a Dutch company in Holland which is undertaking some building work there. For various reasons, the Dutch company then needs to have an office in London, perhaps in order to help in matters of finance.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1094</span>
Perhaps the question of the dollar premium arises and it needs more finance from London than from Dutch sources and thus it needs a branch in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The man at the head of the company at the Manchester branch decides to buy for the Dutch company a site in London with planning permission where its offices are erected. In such circumstances, development land tax might accrue and would be chargeable because it would definitely come within the exclusion of Clause 20(2)(	<i>a</i>). If that were to happen, it would be possible, as the Minister said, to set up a third company—an English company which happens to be directly related to the Dutch subsidiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems to be an unnecessarily cumbersome and tedious way of going about this matter. Surely it should be possible to deal with the sort of circumstances which I have envisaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister criticised the words "permanent establishment" largely on the grounds of grammar in that one cannot do business with a permanent establishment, only with a company or a branch.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take exception to that. I did not criticise on grounds of grammar. I said that there is no such thing as a permanent establishment. It cannot take titlement to property. He could not sell his London office for a permanent establishment of his Dutch company. He would have to sell it to his Dutch company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case I withdraw the word "grammar" and substitute the words "direct meaning". The Minister was quarrelling more with the wording of the amendment than with the concept behind it. The concept behind it, he understood; he did not like it, but he understood it. But he said that in any case, even if he had liked it, he could not possibly have accepted the amendment because of the way in which it was worded. That is not an argument which particularly appeals to Opposition. The Minister knows perfectly well that a drafting point is not a sole ground for resisting an amendment which otherwise has merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has no merit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister thinks that it has no merit. I can only say that I dis-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1156">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1095</span>
agree. I have tried to give a practical example of the circumstances in which this is likely to arise. It could arise quite widely, particularly where it is necessary to have an English branch of an overseas subsidiary. I do not see why it should be necessary to go through all the business of having to set up yet another company solely in order to come within the provisions of Clause 20(2)(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that it would be possible to draw the avoidance details more narrowly than this in order to avoid this question of land just being pushed to and fro and non-existent companies in the Cayman Islands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gave an example of a Dutch company. Rolland is a splendid country which has high rates of tax and belongs to the European Community. I can think of an example of a transfer to a company in the Cayman Islands in exactly the same situation with a branch in London. I am sure that in that case, having said this at the beginning when he moved the amendment, he is not suggesting that we should allow the property to move completely out of the United Kingdom tax net into the non-resident Cayman Islands company where there would be great difficulty in collecting the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the Dutch example was a worthy example and the Cayman Islands example is a bad one. But there is no way of providing for the one without providing for the other. The amendment does not do that. It simply refers to an establishment, whether it is in the Cayman Islands or in Holland. We cannot provide for that kind of situation and we have to protect the Revenue and to prevent property from being moved to the non-resident company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point about the amendment. It is not a drafting objection. The objection is basically one of principle, that these establishments are not bodies which can take assets. I do not see how one can give them an exemption of this kind. One cannot transfer property to a desk or an office or indeed to an office block. It has to go either to a company or to an individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the Minister said about the defective drafting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1096</span>
of the amendment. I suppose that it should have read something like
	<br><blockquote><p>"except where the disposal is to provide a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom".</p></blockquote>
I apologise to the Committee for having proposed it in a form which I agree is not acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister pointed to the difficulty of distinguishing between genuine, 	<i>bona fide</i> transactions and those which might be designed to avoid the tax. I am not entirely convinced that there should not be in the Bill a provision to permit 	<i>bona fide</i> transactions of the kind mentioned by my hon. Friend. I hope that the Minister will take on board the point that we have made and that we can register the fact that there is a case here, that as the Bill stands certain companies and groups may be incommoded in a way which I do not think the Bill intends and which for reasons relating to their capital resources could have adverse consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in view of the deficiencies of the amendment, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 360, in page 31, line 14, leave out 'sections 5 and' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'section 5(5) and, subject to paragraph (	<i>c</i>) below, section'.—[	<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 318, in page 32, line 2, after 'group', insert 'whatsoever'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that there are no drafting deficiencies in this amendment. In fact, its conciseness and elegance are themselves attractive and I hope to persuade the Minister to accept it. I will explain briefly the significance of the amendment. It is basically a probing or drafting amendment to establish what is meant by "any member of a group".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 20(5)(	<i>b</i>) relates to cases where one member of a group developed land for the industrial use of another. By reference back to Clause 19(5)(	<i>a</i>), this exemption is designed to apply to whichever company of a group occupies the property developed by another. The point of the amendment is solely to ensure that we are dealing not with any particular member of a group but with any member of that group. Company A could build a factory and make it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1157">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1097</span>
available to company B within the same group. Company B could leave the group, but the premises could be taken over by company C, which was still a member of the group. Therefore, it is important that it should be understood, even if the amendment is not built into the text of the Bill, that the reference is to any member of the group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance he desires. The reference is to any member of the group whatsoever. The explanation is that the companies of the group and the group itself are treated as one body or single entity even when one of the members of the group is a non-resident company. If a company leaves the group and the land stays with the group, with a particular entity, the land has not left the group. That applies also in the case of a non-resident company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where it differs or where there is an exception is where there is a disposal from one of the members of the group, being a resident member, to a non-resident member and liability is triggered off in that case for the reasons I have given. Also, the stock in trade provisions do not apply because of the difficulty of enforcing liability on a non-resident company. But these are the exceptions in Clause 20(2). Generally the group is the group wheresoever it is, including non-resident members for those purposes, subject to the exceptions in the case of a non-resident member.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation and confirmation. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 374, in page 32, line 13, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(6) Where any of the taxes listed in section 33 of this Act have been suffered by the member of the group of companies ("the transferor") making the transfer or any member of the group from whom the transferor received the interest in land, relief shall be given for those taxes under the provisions of section 33 and the Sixth Schedule to this Act on the subsequent disposal out of the group'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we can also take Amendment No. 375, in Clause 21, page 34, line 14, at end add:

	<br><blockquote><p>'(9) Where any of the taxes listed in section 33 of this Act are suffered by any member of the group on the chargeable company ceasing to be a member of a group or were suffered within the period of six years ending at the time of severance in respect of the relevant interest by any member of the group, relief shall be given for those taxes under the provisions of section 33 and the Sixth Schedule to this Act against the development land tax payable or in determining the realisable development value, as the case may be, arising as a result of the application of the provisions of subsection (2) of this section'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This, in effect, constitutes a separate subsection (6). A similar object is served by Amendment No. 375, which applies to Clause 21.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment may be unnecessary. To that extent, it is a probing amendment, as are so many of the amendments. They start as probing amendments and may end up as straight amendments if we do not get the right assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If company A in a group has land as a fixed asset and transfers it to company B which deals with it as trading stock, company A may have to pay capital gains tax on that transfer. If this takes place within a group the ultimate liability to development land tax seems to go back to company A's cost price or base price. We feel that relief should be allowed in such a case for other tax paid along the line within the group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I commend my hon. Friend on the drafting of his amendment. I am not an expert on Finance Bills so I do not know whether this is precedented, but I like the use of the word "suffered" in relation to payment of tax. That seems to be an appropriate expression.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that these were probing amendments and that he thought they were not really necessary. I can tell him that they were not necessary. Whether my explanation will satisfy him is another matter. Probably the best time to discuss what lies behind these amendments would be on Schedule 6, which deal with the interaction of other taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 374 would provide for interaction relief under Schedule 6 to be given on the disposal of an interest in land by a member of a group of companies in respect of other taxes already paid by that member or another member of the group which had previously owned the interest. Amendment No. 375 would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1158">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1099</span>
similarly provide for interaction relief to be given if the disposal was a notional disposal under Clause 21 when a company leaves a group of companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that both those situations are, in fact, covered by Schedule 6, which, of course, deals with interaction of other taxes and gives relief for the payment of other taxes within the group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman may like to come back to this point when we debate Schedule 6, but I can assure him that the amendments are not necessary as the points are covered in that schedule, which deals in far greater detail with these matters. If he is content with my assurance, we can discuss these matters when we get to Schedule 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister say where on Schedule 6 we ought to deal with it again? We may wish to put down an amendment at that particular spot in Schedule 6, and if his brief indicates the paragraph, it would be a great help to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the general principle. Of course it is a matter which is dealt with in Schedule 6, but if there is a particular point at which we can discuss it again perhaps the Minister will let us know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to let the right hon. Gentleman know. All I can do is to refer to Part II of Schedule 6. I am not trying to avoid his question, but Part II deals with a number of taxes, such as capital gains tax, corporation tax, income tax, capital transfer tax and estate duty, and they are not all dealt with in one paragraph, as he will appreciate. Part II deals with the interaction of those taxes with development land tax, and these are amendments down, in fact, to Part II, so no doubt we shall discuss this in greater detail later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This surely all arises from the fact that we are treating the group as one entity, and that any benefits to that entity will be taken into account for the benefit of the whole group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am told that paragraph 10 of Schedule 6 might help in this kind of case. Of course, the group is treated as one unit for most purposes, but the movement of property within the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1100</span>
group and therefore the charge to tax that might arise is not disregarded for that purpose. If there is a charge for tax within the group, interaction is allowed for development land tax purposes. I do not think there is any inconsistency here. It is a group treated as one unit for one purpose, but there are still different companies and property moves about, so there may be tax charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's remarks, I shall certainly have a look at Schedule 6, paragraph 10, and elsewhere. I do not feel that it has been a waste of time to have tabled amendments of this kind, even though they may subsequently prove to be unnecessary. Without such explanation, which Ministers are prompted to give by such amendments, it is very difficult to ensure that as we go through the Bill clause by clause all the cases arising are reflected by the way in which Schedule 6 is worded. I am glad to have the reference of the Minister, though, in the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister whether he will now carry out the undertaking which he gave, in column 933, of the report of our proceedings of 5th May? He will recall that when I moved Amendment No. 195, I described circumstances in which the White Paper stock in trade exemption available under an earlier clause would not be available to people who were brought within the net of tax by virtue of subsection (2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister wanted time to think about this matter, and, when I referred to it again, he replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I do not wish to evade this question, but the best way to deal with it is for us to consider again the point he made and I shall answer him when we come to Clause 20(2)."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, Standing Committee J, 5th May 1976; c. 933.]</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether the Minister is now in a position to advise us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two points that I should like to raise. I shall refer first to Amendment No. 391, which was not called. All it does, on the surface,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1159">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1101</span>
is to change the words in lines 9 and 10, But, in fact, it does more than that. It was designed as a probing amendment to discover what lines 8, 9 and 10 meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (2) of Clause 20 disguises cases which are not covered by subsection (1)—in other words, the general provisions disregarding transfers within a group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to know whether the three lines beginning
	<br><blockquote><p>"but a disposal shall not be regarded as one to which that subsection does not apply by reason only that it is in fact a disposal for which no consideration is given"</p></blockquote>
relate to paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) of subsection (2) or whether it is a separate idea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it would be better, when one is trying to use words in their non-technical sense, that one does not use them in the precise order of a technical term. There are provisions in the Bill where consideration may be given for a disposal, yet it is treated with the disposal for which no consideration is given. We have cases where no consideration is given for a disposal but it is treated as a disposal for which consideration is given. Therefore, it seems that if one could try to avoid confusion by putting the words such as I have suggested, that no consideration is, in fact, given for it, the confusion might be eased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this raises the point about the general meaning of lines 8 to 10 on page 31 of the Bill. Perhaps we could have a brief comment from the Minister on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point that I should like to mention, for reassurance, is to establish that stock in trade exemptions are preserved under all circumstances within a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1102</span>
group. It is important that this should be so, but so many things in this Bill are provided for by inference and by the cumulative inference of different provisions in different places. It would be helpful if we could have an assurance from the Minister that any intra-group transfers relating to an interest in land which all the time remains a stock in trade, carry with them the exemptions all the time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), who asked me to clarify the questions he asked me previously on stock in trade exemptions. As he will know, and as we have discussed on some of the amendments, where there is a transfer from a resident member to a non-resident member, Clause 20(2)(	<i>a</i>) does not treat that as a disposal for no consideration unless it is a disposal for no consideration.
