	<div class='clause'>Clause 9</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DEVOLUTION ON DEATH</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<i>Question proposed</i>—[	<i>27th April</i>]—That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When our last sitting was adjourned I was floundering somewhat in trying to find the right way to express what I had in mind in my complaints on this clause, so it is probably best if I give an example to show what I had in mind. Let us take a Dickens example on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose that Mr. Pickwick dies, owning Blackacre. Blackacre is sold by Mr. Pickwick's personal representatives—no doubt, Messrs. Dodson and Fogg—to a stranger, say, Sam Weller. That is treated as a sale by the late Mr. Pickwick, if I understand this clause correctly. But if Blackacre passes to Messrs. Dodson and Fogg, not as personal representatives but as Settled Land Act trustees, or as representatives of some other kind, again the sale to a stranger is treated as a sale by the late Mr. Pickwick. I think I am correct so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the personal representatives of the late Mr. Pickwick transfer Blackacre to themselves, as trustees for a specific legatee or devisee who is an infant—say, the Fat Boy—that seems to expend their exemption and if the trustees, who were personal representatives but who have transferred the property to themselves, as trustees, then sell, say, to Snodgrass, that is a disposal which will result in a tax liability in respect of the realised development value. At least, it does not seem to be protected by this clause, as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a case where personal representatives have transferred to themselves, as trustees for, say, an infant beneficiary. In fairness, the realised development value which may result from that should not be taxable. It may be that that disposal
	<span class='label label-info column'>644</span>
comes under Clause 10—disposal by a donee—but that is not clear. It is a disposal by trustees for a donee and, as such, as we have said in the course of amendments, is less beneficial if it comes under Clause 10, than if it comes under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the next example. If Messrs. Dodson and Fogg, as the personal representatives, decide to transfer Blackacre to Mrs. Bardell, as a beneficiary under the will of the late Mr. Pickwick, instead of handing over to her the proceeds of sale—and there seems to be little difference between the proceeds of sale, if the person represented himself, and handing them over 	<i>in specie,</i> which we touched on in an earlier amendment—if she eventually sells, that sale, as I understand it, will be a taxable disposal. That seems to be grossly unfair and something of a nonsense. Again, it may come within Clause 10, because she will have been a donee under the will, but it will not be so beneficial to her as if it came under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose, in another case, Pickwick left Blackacre to Snodgrass in his will, and Whiteacre to Mr. Jingle. After he dies, Snodgrass wants Whiteacre and not Blackacre, and Jingle wants Blackacre and not Whiteacre. So they ask Messrs. Dodson and Fogg, as the personal representatives, to draw up a deed of arrangement, swopping the properties. But Blackacre is worth £10 more than Whiteacre. So Jingle pays the £10 balance, and he receives Blackacre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand that, neither Snodgrass nor Jingle get the benefit of Clause 9 if they then dispose of either of their properties. However, Snodgrass gets the benefit of Clause 10 because he received his property without paying any consideration for it. Jingle does not, however. get the benefit of Clause 10 because he paid some consideration, however 	<i>de minimis.</i> Clause 10 applies only if there is no consideration passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose one can shrug one's shoulders and say that is fair justice or, with Sam Weller, "There's a Providence in it all". I recollect that his father replied, "Of course, there is. What would become of the undertakers without it, Sammy? ". It seems unfair in those cases, and I imagine that this clause will give rise to a great deal of litigation if that sort of situation arises. I hope that the matter can be looked at again to see that the beneficiary in such cases does stand in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0917">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>645</span>
shoes of the deceased if he has merely received the property straight from the personal representatives. There does not seem to be any difference between that and receiving the proceeds of sale. I have a suspicion that if the clause stands unamended it will be an invitation to litigation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I conclude by again quoting Mr. Weller, not Sam, who said: "Battledore and shuttlecock's a wery good game when you ain't the shuttlecock and two lawyers the battledores, in which case it gets too excitin' to be pleasant."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has raised a number of interesting examples, and I would be foolish to try to give clear answers to every example. In the main I go along with most of what he said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case he first outlined was that of Mr. Pickwick dying and of personal representatives then transferring the property to trustees for beneficiaries or an infant. He is right on Clause 9, as I read it, that the exemption would not help in regard to the transfer from the personal representatives to themselves as trustees or, indeed, to anybody else as trustees, although whether to themselves or somebody else should not make any difference. That transfer would not be protected by Clause 9. Whether it is protected by Clause 10 is something that we can discuss later when we come to that clause, because the transfer will be, in most cases, for no value and would seem to be within the principles of Clause 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then dealt with the exchange of property, where Blackacre and Whiteacre are exchanged and a payment of £10 is made. He is again correct. If £10 is paid, that is a sale or a transfer at an undervalue, and does not get the benefit of Clause 10 in relation to costs of acquisition. However, since the transfer is merely for £10 at an undervalue, there will not be a tax charge at that time. I accept that later on, as I believe the right hon. Gentleman was implying, if the property was sold the cost of acquisition would be £10, and not the historical cost of acquisition, taking the matter back through previous ownerships. To that extent there may be an injustice,
	<span class='label label-info column'>646</span>
but no doubt we can also deal with that when we debate Clause 10.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once the property moves from the personal representatives to either trustees or beneficiaries, the benefit of Clause 9 is lost. Whether some other protection will be obtained, in relation to Clause 10 or otherwise, I shall consider in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there may be problems here, and we shall look at his examples to see whether or not we are creating anomolies and try to make it as easy as possible for personal representatives in these cases. Of course, there will always be circumstances in which it is impossible to legislate, and there may be cases where people will have to think about the legislation and act upon it in relation to how property is transferred from personal representatives. The personal representatives will be under a duty, as they are now, to consider the taxation provisions for estate duty, capital gains tax and so on before they come to their final decisions on the dissolution of the estate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>INTERESTS IN LAND ACQUIRED BY GIFT OR, IN CERTAIN CASES, AT AN UNDER VALUE</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 243, in page 13, line 10, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1)(A) Where the donor's interest was that of Trustees of a settlement (other than Trustees within the meaning of section 27 of this Act) subsection (2) below shall apply as if references to the donor's interest shall include a reference to both the settlor's and the Trustee's interests subject to a reference to the market value at 6th April 1965 being substituted for the cost of acquisition if the settlor's acquisition were before that date and limiting the expenditure on improvements or relevant improvements, as the case may be, to that incurred on or before 6th April 1965'.</p></blockquote>
This is purely a probing amendment. It relates to some extent to the point that has just been raised in regard to settlements which go to the intermediary of trustees. All we are trying to do in this amendment is to ensure that all costs of acquisition and improvements are aggregated in the case of settlements that have gone through trustees to the final beneficiary, so that we ensure that settlors, trustees' and beneficiaries' improvement and acquisition costs are all aggregated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0918">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>647</span>
We have added one special factor where we have tried to suggest that the market valuation on 6th April 1965 is introduced instead of the cost of acquisition. This relates to base A in Clause 5. But we think that it is particularly relevant here where in many cases estates may have gone into the hands of trustees well before April 1965. This was argued on Clause 5. but here one has the special problem of trying to ascertain in many cases costs which are now historical costs. Therefore, on the grounds of simplicity it would be better to have the market valuation at 6th April 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is the additional point to which we hope to return in another amendment. We have the problem of inflation as well. We believe that both the simplicity and the inflation arguments are covered by substituting market value for the cost of acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, this is a probing amendment merely to ensure that the improvement and acquisition costs are aggregated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I can give the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) some of the assurance he seeks, although possibly I cannot go along with him on the second part of his argument in relation to the date of 6th April 1965. We discussed some of this matter in a previous debate on a previous amendment, and, as I said at that time, the costs of acquisition will be allowed and so will expenditure on improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only major cost which will not be allowed is special addition, which stops at the point of the gift. This matter was touched upon yesterday, and hon. Members objected and said that the special addition should be allowed to run on beyond the point of the gift so that when property eventually comes to be disposed of a special addition is still available. That is the extra special addition beyond the point of the gift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that this would be unduly generous. In fact, once a person has decided to give away his property, and this is a voluntary act on his behalf, we do not think that the very generous special addition should be allowed to continue. This addition was introduced to enable the owner to cushion him from the very high costs of interest at that time, and it has been generally accepted in most of the Professional Press on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>648</span>
I was reading something the other day which said that the special addition was very generous. But I do not think that it would be right to allow it to continue beyond the time of gift, because the owner has then decided to give away his property, and that is an entirely voluntary act on his part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that the property will continue to bear interest charges; or it may be that it will not continue to bear interest charges. It does not necessarily follow that the property will bear those interest charges. The special addition is a rather rough and ready solution, but I think it is a good solution. However, we do not think we could allow it to continue beyond the gift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman quite fairly said that he would like to see 6th April 1965 as the date, and in some cases it would of course reduce the tax on taxpayers. We cannot go along with that. He also made the point that choosing a date in that way would simplify the administration to some extent, otherwise we would have to go back much further to find the costs of acquisition. There is something in that argument, but it can be exaggerated. I shall try to explain why.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, base A or base C will be in point only where the original acquisition cost contained some element of development value. Otherwise base B, which is current use value on disposal plus 10 per cent., will usually be advantageous and will of course reflect the value of improvements to the land in its current use. This will apply in most cases where land was donated, or passed on death, before 6th April 1965, since it is unlikely that development value purchased before then will have remained unrealised for so long. In most cases we would be concerned with base B, which is not cost of acquisition but current use value on disposal plus 10 per cent. Most other cases would probably not be covered by bases A or C, for the reason I have just given. In the exceptional case this may well be so, and it may be necessary to look back some considerable time. We accept that in those cases more work will be involved. However, in the majority of cases we do not think that this will be so, because the base used will be base B, which is current use value on disposal plus 10 per cent.,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0919">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>649</span>
not cost of acquisition. It is only in relation to cost of acquisition that we shall have to go back beyond 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be problems in some cases, but I cannot accept the date 6th April 1965. That would apply, not only to this amendment and this situation, but to all situations. We do not think that it would be right for development value to be frozen at that date and taxed only from that date onwards, unlike the capital gains tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon. Gentleman's main point, I can give him the assurance in relation to cost of acquisition and expenditure on improvements which are reflected in the value of the land, but the special addition will not be allowed beyond the time and date of the actual gift.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful for the clarification in the first part of the Minister's remarks. There is an issue between us on special addition, and we shall return to that in later amendments. We cannot see the logic of taking out the special addition at this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that proviso and that reflection on something to which we want to return, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 244, in page 13, line 19, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'except that there the donor's interest was acquired before 6th April 1965, the market value at that date shall be substituted for the cost of acquisition;'.</p></blockquote>
This is an issue which I—I think that I carry my right hon. and hon. Friends with me—think is important. We have touched on it in the previous amendment, and I raised it on Clause 5. We feel it important to recognise in the Bill the considerable rates of inflation which have taken place historically, and most significantly in recent times, in this country. We think that the Bill as it stands could be immensely unfair to those who transact and those who pass on and inherit land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I made this point in the debate on clause 5 I received a rather strange answer from the Financial Secretary, which I do not think is good enough. He said this at the Committee's Seventh Sitting:
	<span class='label label-info column'>650</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The hon. Gentleman will recall the arguments against indexation adduced from both sides in debates on the Finance Bill".</p></blockquote>
The Financial Secretary later made this very strange comment:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I am afraid that, despite the Inland Revenue's attention to these points and its willingness to consider examples of possible hardship, none have been forthcoming. Perhaps I may now repeat the offer and promise further consideration of any real examples of hardship"—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee J;</i> 6th April 1976, c. 350.]</p></blockquote>
This arose from the question of inflation and the way in which the Bill does not implicitly tackle inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To accept that kind of comment at face value poses some very serious issues of principle to which my right hon. friend referred in summing up that debate. If we accept such a response to an argument of this sort, we have politics or government by exception, by nods and winks from the Treasury box, and we create such complex and unsatisfactory legislation that the only way in which things can work is for there to be a period in which the Act comes into force and is then implemented, is seen not to work and is superseded by a whole range of Press releases and circulars. We have seen about six of those in the case of the Community Land Act where an interpretation is given subsequent to the Act being passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that if we are to take the Financial Secretary's comments in response to the arguments about a need for some form of indexation at face value, we are into a constitutionally very serious situation, where we do not have Bills which set out the position in principle, but which are a model and which are superseded by circulars which allow—at the whim, presumably, of the Civil Service and the Minister—exceptions as we go along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beseech the Government to appreciate that there is a grave danger of great hardship to individuals unless we allow some form of indexation and replace historical cost valuation with some form of more recent market valuation or indexation as suggested by the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that all this refers to base A. The Minister made the point in the last debate. Therefore, it could be argued that base B should have to apply. There will be many cases where it would be extremely disadvantageous and unfair if base B had to apply. The proper way to go about this is to establish within base A some recognition of the high rates
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0920">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>651</span>
of inflation which have occurred in the past 20 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure I quoted in the debate on 6th April was that the RPI had gone up in 20 years by 227 per cent. This factor is not recognised in this legislation, and I fear that, unless we recognise it in the legislation, what will result is the flow of circulars as we had following the CTT and the Community Land Act. If that situation arises we are into a totally new constitutional situation in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have now seen two Acts passed through Parliament, and here is another measure so complex, so vague, so lacking in recognition of the needs of citizens, that inevitably there flows a whole mass of Press releases, explanations and circulars from Departments subsequently. That by-passes Parliament and the Constitution upon which our country rests. This is very serious. I sincerely beg the Minister to consider including within the Bill some recognition of the rapid inflation which has hit this country in the past 20 years. Otherwise, we shall have a very unfair piece of legislation about which something will have to be done—and I suspect that it would be done on an 	<i>ad hoc</i> basis, certainly as implied by the Financial Secretary's remarks some weeks ago, which I found very disturbing indeed and needing some comment from the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to support my hon. Friend, and I hope that the Minister of State will welcome the opportunity to amplify and perhaps explain what seem to me to have been curious and rather unjustified remarks in the earlier debate. It is very hard to see why value before 6th April 1965 should not be admissible value in any circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I draw the Minister's attention to another point. Clause 10(2)(	<i>c</i>) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the current use value of the relevant interest at the time of its acquisition or on 6th April 1965".</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister of State is by now aware of some of the complexities of determining what in fact is current use value as opposed to market value. Market value was fairly fully described in Clause 7, which we have already discussed, and related to a definition of market value bringing in the kind of development that might be permitted at any given time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>652</span>
I put to the Minister a specific case which is known to me. A site which was bombed during the war is zoned under CDA No. 1 of the Greater London Council in part for office development and in part for warehouse development. The site was in use on 6th April 1965 as a car park, but its use as a bomb-site car park was only a temporary permission. What is the current use value of a site which is being used as a car park but with only temporary permission for such use? I do not know whether it is true of this case, but the permission might well have expired on 7th April 1965 for all I know. I cannot see any great current use value in being allowed to use the site for one more day as a car park, or perhaps not even for that day, and under this definition one has no right to use it for anything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why cannot we have market value? I am glad to see the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) nodding. I hope that he was nodding in agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack Dunnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not nodding at the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I was falling asleep.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not going to sleep. I had hoped that he might be nodding in assent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Market value is readily determinable and known. It can be calculated, given the facts at any time. But current use value is a very doubtful concept. First, therefore, I think that we should get rid of this idea of current use value at 6th April 1965. It will give rise to many difficulties in the kind of case to which I have referred. Second, I hope that the Minister of State will consider more kindly allowing values going back to an earlier date, which would be only fair. So far as I can see, we have not yet heard any justification for refusing to admit values based on an earlier date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To deal first with the last point, I am not quite sure what the hon. Gentleman wants. He says that it is very difficult to ascertain current use value, especially at 6th April 1965. Yet he wants us to go back further and have current use value even before that date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Minister of State has been listening with his usual close attention.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that, but the hon. Gentleman's final point was that he wanted current use value before 6th April 1965.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right. I withdraw what I said. The hon. Gentleman would prefer to have market value. In that case, of course, he is really saying that we should have no legislation at all in relation to betterment, to use his word, which I think is a better one in many ways. He is saying "Let us not have that kind of taxation ", because the whole basis of a betterment tax or development tax is that there should be an ascertainment of current use value and of market value. In a rough and ready way, the difference between the two is the betterment value of the land. That is what it is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that he wants to get away from current use value. At some times it is easier than at others to find out what is the current use value. For instance, a farm bought for development could be valued from the agricultural value. Of course, there will be more difficult cases like the car park the hon. Gentleman mentioned, but members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors are well trained and well versed in these matters, and they will arrive at a valuation which is both fair and reasonable in most cases.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could explain that, wide as is the experience and depth of knowledge of the members of the RICS, they do not deal in property at current use value; they deal in property at market value. In certain cases, there just is not a current use value. The Minister of State must direct his mind to that situation. In the particular example I gave, there is no such thing as a current use value. If he persists in leaving that phrase in with that date attached to it, there will be cases where it is absolutely meaningless. But there would be a market value which would be related to the development that would be permitted at that time. That does not include betterment. Betterment arises from changes afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like to argue with the hon. Gentleman. He says that
	<span class='label label-info column'>654</span>
there cannot be a current use value in his example. I do not know. He is more experienced than I in these matters. It might be that other members of the RICS would disagree with him. I find it difficult to say that there cannot be any current use value. Of course, people usually value on the basis of market value—the basis of most of our legislation—but we are now introducing legislation where it is necessary to find out current use value, and no doubt valuers will have to adapt themselves, like everyone else has to from time to time with changing legislation. No doubt, expertise will build up and it will not be too long before—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is shaking his head. In that case, I think he does his own profession a great injustice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman does his honorary profession some injustice, and I suggest that, if he talked to some active members, they might not hold the same view as he does, although I accept entirely that there will be some cases where it will be difficult to get the current use value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) raised the question of rates of inflation. This is a general point to which we frequently return in our debates on taxation, that it is unfair that people should be taxed on what are inflationary gains. Of course that is so. It is also unfair that people with a fixed rate of interest from a building society, a savings bank or any other institution should see the real value of their interest going down from time to time because of high rates of inflation. Inflation is unfair, and the Government accept that entirely. That is why we are trying to reduce the rate of inflation. We cannot pursue that particular debate now, but I would say that, if there is unfairness, it is not just in the taxation system and it is not just the owners of capital who suffer. People who receive income and people on small incomes suffer in the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that one can justify introducing legislation to protect the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0922">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>655</span>
owners of certain types of property from the unfairness of inflation without bringing it across the board, and then one has indexation for rent payments and interest payments, and possibly indexed payments to foreigners who deposit money in this country. The Government do not believe that that is the way to deal with inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At our seventh sitting, my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Reference has already been made to the problem of records prior to 1965."</p></blockquote>
We have dealt with that again today.
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is the further difficulty of trying to assess what there might be in the way of hardship to those who have had increases in current use values. I am afraid that, despite the Inland Revenue's attention to these points and its willingness to consider examples of possible hardship, none have been forthcoming. Perhaps I may now repeat the offer and promise further consideration of any real examples of hardship."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee J,</i> 6th April 1976; 	<i>c.</i> 350.]</p></blockquote>
If I may put this gloss on what my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said, he was relating his words to the provision which restricts the increase in current use value in base A to the increase from 6th April 1965. That is what he was dealing with. What he asked for, and what we ask for, is practical evidence from the professions, from people who deal in these matters, that that provision will cause hardship in practice. He was not saying that there may be hardship due to general rates of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said—I suggest that it is reasonably clear—that the Bill precludes anyone going back further than 1965 but that the Government are prepared to look between now and Report at evidence that might suggest that the provision would cause hardship. That is all that he said. He was not saying that in the general administration of the legislation we would consider claims of hardship and try to deal with it on a discretionary basis. My hon. Friend was specifically dealing with that particular aspect. If we are given examples of hardship caused by the provision, we shall consider them, without commitment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of indexation is a large one. I should have thought that this form of tax presented less of a problem in terms of inflation than other taxes, because with this tax the jump in the increase of the value of the land takes place due to planning permission. There may then be an increase of value due to
	<span class='label label-info column'>656</span>
inflation, but that jump has nothing to do with inflation. Because a local authority grants planning permission, the value of the land jumps. That profit is taxed under the legislation, but the profit itself has nothing to do with inflation, whereas in the case of capital gains I accept that some of the increase in current use value is caused by inflation. But the main profit in cases liable to this tax does not come through inflation. I do not rest on the argument, but to some extent we might say that so far as this tax is concerned the injustice of inflation is less than it is in relation to other taxes and other forms of income.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to return to the point, but I still feel that the Minister is not grasping what we are trying, perhaps inadequately, to get over. He referred to the gain arising from the granting of planning permission almost as if this were something done at the whim of the local authority regardless of any previous situation. That is not so, or it should not be so. I agree that sometimes it appears to be done in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the use of the phrase "current use value", I am particularly concerned about its relation to a bit of land which has a current use. It could be used for offices, industrial premises, or perhaps a car park, used on a temporary basis, which use has to end at a certain time. The period might be two or three years, or merely days. That land must then revert to its previous use. But it might be a building incapable of use for its previous purpose without reconstruction. It might be a bomb-site, as in the case I quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be reasonable to assume that planning permission would be granted for redevelopment on that site in conformity with the zoning in operation. That is not betterment. Betterment means that a local authority which had previously zoned half the site for offices suddenly decided to zone the whole site for offices. That would create a changed situation. What worries me—I think that the Minister of State will find that this is so if he consults his Department experts—is that there are occasions when the use of the phrase "current use value" instead of "market value" will lead to an almost impossible valuation situation and eliminate from consideration of the base value something which was genuinely there and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0923">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>657</span>
is not relevant, namely, the right to build or rebuild on a site in conformity with the then zoning of that land, which may have been the zoning ever since 1947 and never been changed. This case needs to be considered. Otherwise, there will be a lot of difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I do not understand these matters as well as the hon. Gentleman does. I am quite prepared to look at the case he mentions to see whether there is a problem. I cannot give any commitment to erase the phrase "current use value" from this Bill. Of course, we shall not. That is the whole basis of the legislation, as I explained. Even if there is a problem, we may not be able to do much about it within the framework of the legislation, but we shall look at the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, the Minister's last remarks were the most pertinent of all. As he said, this amendment to some extent goes to the very root, not of the idea of the basic tax, but certainly of the way in which the tax is to be computed. Therefore, the Government's tactics are less than frank when they say that they will look at the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given no assurance, quite rightly, but the idea that the Government will look at special cases of unfairness and in the same breath say that they cannot give any assurance and that there is no intention of altering the basis on which the tax is computed is less than frank. Let us be euphemistic about it. So when the Financial Secretary or the Minister say "We shall look at special cases", they are not really saying very much.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I fear that when the unfairnesses and special cases arise they will be so serious that we shall have this kind of subsequent-to-Act 	<i>ad hoc</i> actions, circulars, Press releases, interpretative Press releases by civil servants and, indeed, by Ministers, giving a kind of gloss—in some cases, with the Community Land Act, going well beyond gloss and actually implementing changed policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certainly the three recent Acts, this one being the third, have been so complex and so ill thought-out that, inevitably, we are in a situation where Ministers are saying "Show us unfairnesses. If you
	<span class='label label-info column'>658</span>
cannot, because it has not been implemented, when the unfairnesses come out, civil servants will take over." They will create all sorts of exemptions outside the direct control of Parliament. I believe that that is extremely worrying from the point of view of legislative development in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that inflation is unfair—but so what? That is not quite fair, because he said he was doing something about it. But it was implied that it is just one of the unfairnesses of life. That would be easier to take were it not coming from a party which bases the entire purpose of this legislation upon trying to be fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clearly shows the anomalies and absurdities that arise when one tries to set right the unfairnesses of life. One says "One kind of situation is unfair. Therefore, we shall legislate with the maximum complexity and obscurity against it. Then along comes another case of unfairness, in this case caused by inflation, and that is outside our control, so we cannot do anything about it." To my mind, that indicates the absurdity of trying to legislate against unfairness. But that is a rather wider issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rest my case on the grounds that there is no recognition in the Bill of the massive inflation that is taking place and that this will result in very great distortions and will certainly affect the whole supply of land. On these grounds, and the additional ground that eventually, if the Bill is enacted, all kinds of unconstitutional actions subsequent to its passing will have to be taken, I strongly urge my right hon. and hon. Friends to press this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am absolutely fascinated by the curious theory that the inroads of inflation should be remedied or restored in one particular area—namely, by those who are in possession of land. It is obvious that inflation applies right across the board, and its impact is probably greater on those with small or fixed incomes than on those on whose behalf concern is today being expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note from a Parliamentary Question this week that the value of the maternity grant has diminished since 1968 from its original £25 to £11. At the same time, we have bombardment from hon. Members opposite in an open declaration that they
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0924">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>659</span>
are opposed to any further public spending. They must be consistent. I do not see how we can possibly set about remedying inflation in one isolated section of the community. We must accept that the intention must be to halt, curb and cure inflation. But to try to deal with the situation in one section only seems absurd, and I am surprised that the Minister is generous enough to say that he is prepared to look at the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must respond to that intervention. The only reason for discussing or concentrating upon the effects of inflation upon the holders and conveyors of estate is that this is what this Bill is about. That is the whole point. We are trying to tax one type of person. We ask the Government to bear in mind, in assessing the tax, the rate of inflation affecting the values upon which the tax is based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I certainly would not dispute the hon. Gentleman's claim that inflation is bad in general and affects other people, but this Bill discriminates against one section of the community. Therefore, it is absolutely legitimate to argue that when we are taxing that section of the community we should bear in mind the rate of inflation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I had better come back briefly. My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Rodgers) said that I said that I would look at it. I said only that I would look at the specific point mentioned by the hon Member for Worcestershire, South, (Mr. Spicer) in relation to the difficulty in some cases of arriving at current use value. The hon. Member said that it was impossible to arrive at current use value in that kind of case, and I said that I would look at it, which I shall do, despite the hon. Gentleman's strictures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that Treasury Ministers should not say that they will look at things. Perhaps they should say only that they will actually do things. But I cannot stand up in Committee and say "Yes, we will do so and so". It is helpful to the Committee if I say that I shall look at something. I cannot make a commitment. I was trying to be fair by saying that we cannot change the basis of legislation on current use value. But in the particular instance he mentioned, we shall look at it to see whether we agree with what he says—namely, that in such cases
	<span class='label label-info column'>660</span>
it is very difficult or impossible for professional valuers to arrive at current use value, and this is what I shall look at, nothing else. I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman went on at such length about inflation. We are talking about indexation, but we cannot talk about that in relation to one piece of legislation or one tax; we must index across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the trouble with hon. Members opposite. When they talk about index ation, they want only to index taxation, and mainly capital taxation at that. They must also index payments made to small savers, savings payments, payments of interest. If we start on the indexation road we must index everything. I have never been able to understand whether at the end of the day that helps at all. If we index everything, we are back in the same position. I should not have thought that indexation was a cure for inflation, that it was ameliorative. It would create more problems and merely shift injustices from one section to another, as would happen if the hon. Gentleman had his way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right way to cure inflation is to bring down the rate of inflation, as we are doing. I wish that hon. Gentlemen opposite would sometimes give us some credit. We do not know how they would deal with the problem. For a start, they would never get an agreement out of the TUC. They would never get an agreement on incomes, and then they would try to cure inflation by substantially cutting public expenditure. I do not know what that would do to the country's economy or to employment and everything else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Opposition are so concerned about inflation, they could at least give the Government some credit for the steps we are taking, and the statesmanship of the trade union movement in entering into these agreements to reduce the rate of inflation, as we are doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not wish to pursue that argument, Mr. Crawshaw, as it is far wider than this amendment. Again, I repeat that I shall look at the specific point raised by the hon. Member for Hove, but the general point, and the general tenor of the amendment, I cannot countenance or accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 169, in page 13, line 35, leave out paragraph (	<i>d</i>) and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(	<i>d</i>) for the purpose of section 6 above the chargeable person shall be treated as having acquired his interest at the time of acquisition of the donor's interest'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 245, in page 13, line 35, leave out from beginning to end of line 3 on page 14 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(	<i>d</i>) section 6 above shall apply with the proviso that the period beginning at the time of the chargeable person's acquisition of the relevant interest and ending at the time of disposal shall include the period of ownership of the donor or where that donor received the interest for no consideration, the period of ownership of the previous donor'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can move this amendment briefly. It comes back to the question of the special addition. I do not wish to go over the points which we have made rather blandly, and to which the Government have given their opposing views. Simply, we do not accept the logic of disallowing the special addition under Clause 10. We think that the effect is particularly illogical on one specific category. This is reflected in Amendment No. 245, which is concerned with the making of gifts to wives. This appears to us to be a category to which it would be logical to apply the special addition, even viewing the subject from the Government's standpoint.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was this Government who made the special allowance to husbands and wives in the capital transfer tax. Therefore, it seems to us, even looking at the matter from the Government's point of view, that it would be logical to exempt from the special addition the passing on of gifts from husbands to wives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to say anything else, save to repeat that, despite all the arguments, we cannot see why the special addition should not run on when in many cases interest payments will run on. If one argues that the special addition should be
	<span class='label label-info column'>662</span>
taken off, one might as well argue that, in computing the tax, every other kind of benefit should be taken out. We cannot see why the Government should make this special provision whereby the special addition is taken out, particularly with respect to wives.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rightly said that we have been over this ground to some extent before. He baffled me a little when speaking of gifts to wives. I accept entirely that, as the Bill is drawn, all gifts to wives or anyone else are affected by the rule that the special addition stops. But I could see nothing in either of the amendments seeking to give some exemption in the case of wives. I am not making a drafting point, for this is not a drafting point. I take it the hon. Gentleman is making an example, saying that in the case of gifts to wives it is unfair because they are different from other gifts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment goes much wider and does not seek to narrow the ground to gifts to wives. However illogical it might seem—and logic does not always help in these matters, because it may be said that the special addition was rather illogical—we have agreed to the special addition. I should have thought it illogical, an overused word, to say that it should run on after a gift. If a man decides to make a gift, it is a voluntary act. If he has bought a property and intends to develop it, he gets special addition. But if he decides to give it away—he may not give the burden of interest charges away—does the hon. Gentleman propose to give special addition in that case?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was worried about that point of logic. It seems to me that the special addition is absolutely logical. If one is trying to add up costs of improvement, the interest rate on borrowed money is logically part of those costs. I cannot see that the hon. Gentleman can base his case on the fact that his Bill is illogical, in that respect at least.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0926">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>663</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not introducing special additions. They are not specific costs. We are saying that, due to circumstances created by the hon. Gentleman's Government when they were in power, and due to the carnage they created in the property market, with interest rates being so high, we thought it only fair that we should give to builders and developers some alleviation from the misplaced zeal of the previous administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to help. We are not saying "What were your interest charges? You can deduct them". But we are saying that during that period the price of land and the cost of borrowing was high and that we will give an addition to the costs of acquisition. That is where we start. It is not a logical principle in itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when a person decides to give away his property, he may not give away the interest charges but bear them himself. It is a voluntary act. In the case of husbands and wives, we treat them in the legislation as separate individuals, and there are benefits arising from that. If the hon. Gentleman says that gifts from husbands to wives should not be subjected to the "loss" of special addition, if he is logical he should say that husbands and wives should not be treated separately in the legislation. Perhaps they should not be treated separately, but all sorts of consequences would follow from that. We have treated them as separate individuals, and they will benefit from that to some extent. In many other taxation provisions they are not treated separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not rest on that point, however. What I am saying is that we are treating them separately for these purposes and for other purposes, and in the case of the other purposes it may be beneficial to them. So if the hon. Gentleman does not want special additions to stop in relation to gifts between husbands and wives, then we must go back to the principle of the provision and ask ourselves whether we want them to be treated as separate persons or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot go along with the hon. Gentleman. I do not think that it is illogical. A special addition is a useful help, but if people decide to give away their property, for whatever reason. it is only fair that we should say that the benefit stops, because we could say "The
	<span class='label label-info column'>664</span>
benefit was to you, for you, for the cost of your acquisition, and if you choose to change the rules and the situation we cannot go further". We have been generous in giving the special addition in the first place. I recognise that there is a difference between us, and I am afraid I cannot give any undertaking to look at the matter again or to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) on two amendments now seems to have provoked the Minister to political speeches. If the Minister starts making political speeches in this Committee, we shall not get on very fast with the Bill. We have tried to keep off politics as much as possible and deal with the Bill as a practical measure put before us to carry out the Government's wishes. We are trying to point out how extremely badly the Bill as drafted will carry out anything at all in many cases, except to confuse everybody and put people to considerable hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the special addition was given to the person who was holding the property, and that if that person chooses to give it away the special addition stops. I cannot see the slightest logic in that. The logic is that we are treating the donee, whether he is a donee by reason of somebody's death or whether it is a gift 	<i>inter vivos,</i> as standing in the shoes of the donor. He should stand in the shoes of the donor so far as the special addition is concerned as well as everything else. That is the logic of it. The donee's money is lying idle in the property just as much as the donor's. There is no logic in saying that he is not entitled to the special addition, that it is something specially related to a person before he has given his property away and does not follow into the hands of the donee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend was quite right to propose this amendment, and, since the Minister has not given us any indication that he wishes to consider the matter further, we should put on record our disgust by dividing the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 112, in page 15, line 14, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7) For the purposes of this section a disposal of an interest in land on the occasion of the dissolution or annulment of marriage shall be treated as a case where no consideration is given for the acquisition of the interest by the chargeable person'.</p></blockquote>
Perhaps we can get off politics on this amendment and get on to a good discussion of Development Land Tax. I admit that I did not invent this amendment—indeed, I admit to the Committee that I did not invent any of them—but it has come forward from representations to us—and I am sure also to the Government—from the Law Society, no less. From that august body, one learns that there is, in its view some doubt within this legislation—it may be more than doubt in the view of the Law Society—that settlements on separation or divorce, should not be treated as disposals where no consideration was given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Were that not the case, we would be grateful to the Financial Secretary for an assurance on that point. If, however, it is the case, it would be unfair because where settlements occur on divorce or separation—in other words, through a freak of nature, to coin a phrase—through no premeditated tax avoidance intention, the person who receives the land will, under the legislation as drafted, not take over any base costs which would bring down the level of taxation. I should be grateful for an assurance from the Financial Secretary that we have misinterpreted the Bill in some way, which seems unlikely. We therefore move this amendment to try to exempt, or to ease the situation for this unlucky group of people who are certainly not in the business of trying to avoid taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I ask a question which may be better debated on "clause stand part". Why is less than full consideration treated separately from no consideration? If we could get away from the anomalous
	<span class='label label-info column'>666</span>
situation within this clause, there would be no need for this amendment. I would be grateful for clarification on the Secretary's thinking on differentiating between partial or semi-gifts, which are made with an under-valuation, and those for which no consideration is given. This appears to be an anomalous position within this clause, and if we could get rid of it, I could immediately withdraw this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the hon. Gentleman disclaim any invention of the amendment. I am not sure what an invented amendment is, but I certainly took the point of this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this amendment were to be carried, the consequence of it would be that a transfer of land on the dissolution of a marriage, whether by divorce or separation, would be regarded as a gift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In examining whether this is the right conclusion, we have to see just what happens on a dissolution or a divorce. On the break up of a marriage there is a settlement transfer of a kind that is normally part of the maintenance considerations between the husband and the wife. It would be quite wrong to treat this transfer as a gift. What happens is that a consideration passes from the one spouse to the other. As we know, it is usually from the husband to the wife, but it could be the other way round. It could be a lump sum, which is one means of assessing a lifetime provision, or a provision for a certain set period of time which the courts might put upon the settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the transfer were for no consideration, there would be no DLT liability by the transferor, but eventually there would be some development land tax payable by the transferee. That deals with one point that the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we can put the mind of the hon. Gentleman at rest, because in the ordinary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0928">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>667</span>
case—if we were to cover every possible contingency the Bill would be many times larger than it unfortunately is—the transfer is usually the transfer of the home. It is unlikely in this case that development land tax will be payable. If there were, we still have the £10,000 provision to catch the unlikely case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is stretching these matters widely to assume that the husband, in the case that I have been considering, will think of the transfer as a gift. In my understanding of these things, the last thing a husband does in such circumstances is to provide a gift to the wife. It is much more usual that it has to be extracted forcibly either the court or by other procedures. To start equating it with a gift would be wholly wrong in view of the way in which these matters are usually determined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not follow that argument at all. Is the Financial Secretary suggesting that there is some consideration when there are settlements forced on the spouses by the court? What normally happens in divorce, annulment of marriage or separation is that there are orders of the court ordering certain property to be transferred from one to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is this to be considered as consideration? If that is so, let us go back to the marriage. As a law student I learned that marriage was a valuable consideration—I never knew quite how valuable, but that is the law. Is a marriage settlement to be subject to tax? If the settlement is to be subject to tax when the marriage is dissolved, I suppose it is subject to tax when the marriage is formed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have stirred up a hornet's nest. Are the Government to tax the settlement between husband and wife when a marriage breaks up, the sort of settlement which, if it is not forced by a court order, is done by agreement between the parties? At present it is fully recognised that the husband is obliged to divide the matrimonial home. That may be exempt elsewhere in the Bill, but it may be that there will be an arrangement for the wife to continue in the matrimonial home and the other property will be divided on the dissolution of the marriage. This raises all sorts of problems. If we are to treat dissolution as a valuable consideration we shall get into all sorts of extraordinary problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment was put on the Amendment Paper for confirmation. I thought
	<span class='label label-info column'>668</span>
we were going to be told that there was no need for this and that of course the realised development value will not be taxed on the dissolution of marriage. I should have thought that "the realised development value on the dissolution of marriage" was a very wrong phrase. There is no development value in dissolving a marriage. But the Financial Secretary suggested that there is some valuable consideration that passes on that occasion. It is a division of the properties between the husband and wife who are being parted at that stage. It leads to further consideration. Settlements on dissolution of marriage frequently take into account any children of the marriage and property is transferred in trust to the children. I hope that will be treated as a gift. Are we to be told that on the dissolution of a marriage, if one gives property to the children of that marriage, there is some realisation of development value?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished that we were not told that this amendment was unnecessary and that the Bill provided for it already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was dismayed and horrified not only by what the Financial Secretary said but by the argument with which he justified it. The argument with which he justified it, which I assume he must have been handed, seemed to me to be particularly strange and twisted. He argued thus. People who get divorced presumably hate one another. People who hate one another presumably do not want to make one another gifts. It would upset people who hate one another to think that money being extracted from them was being treated by the Treasury as a gift. Therefore, it would be wrong to accept this amendment because it would upset people who hate one another to think that what was being extracted from them by a High Court judge was being treated as a gift. That was the logic behind the Financial Secretary's comments. A more assinine piece of logic I cannot imagine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am disturbed by much of what the Financial Secretary said and by so deep a misunderstanding of what happens on the occasion of divorce. I do not doubt that the Treasury would look askance at the appalling concept that people might get away with something by dissolving their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0929">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>669</span>
marriage. Even at a most critical time the Treasury is jealous of loopholes. But if there is any thought in mind that divorce in England is easier than it was, thanks to the minority report of the Royal Commission by a Scottish judge, hopefully it will shortly become easier or simpler in the law of Scotland as a result of a Bill before the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can always dissolve the tie of a spouse in order to get over the grave difficulties of taxation of incomes jointly as though we were a 	<i>unum quid,</i> which married people are treated as being, whereas those who live in sin or in any other form of congregation are not so treated by the Treasury.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The meaning of 	<i>unum quid</i> is "One neuter" what? Could my hon. and learned Friend explain what that means?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thing. If I may put it this way: when 	<i>unus qui</i> and 	<i>una qui</i> get together they are treated as a 	<i>unum quid.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are neutered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It is important to remember—and this may be the thinking behind the Financial Secretary's argument, whether or not he understands it—that in the previous law, I think in England but certainly in Scotland, divorce was treated as equivalent to death. All property rights which could have been claimed upon death were then able to be claimed by the divorcing spouse against the divorced spouse. The legislation in both countries has altered that situation. But it does not alter the fact that the divorced spouse is probably still at a disadvantage, although the intention of the legislation is to find an equitable means, so to speak, of reparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us see what the reparation is intended to be in a divorce settlement if it is not a gift. For instance, if a husband is divorcing a wife it is intended to recompense her for the years she has wasted being his wife when she could have become successful in an alternative occupation other than mother and housewife. That is part of the reparation. The reparation is intended to set her up in a house such as the law fictionally imagines she would have been able to set up had she not taken the refuge in the house provided by her husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>670</span>
Reparation is intended to recompense the wife for all the effort she has made in cooking, washing, bringing up children, and so on. It is not in any sense a transfer of property but a recompense in reparation. It would, therefore, be wrong if that were to be the subject of development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a much more serious point which arises. The interlocutor of a judge on the occasion of a divorce may take various forms. It may merely say the plaintiff will pay to the defendant, or, as in Scotland, the pursuer will pay to the defender, the capital sum of £100,000, and a weekly sum, of whatever it may be. For example, if the defender is a farmer with estates worth £200,000, to comply with the court's order he either has to sell the estate and transfer the money, or transfer half of the estate to his wife.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Often the court makes such an order because, essentially, the amount is to go to the children and to give it to the wife who will care for the children gives the benefit of living there to the children. If development land tax is to be payable, one would not fulfil the orders of the court, because less than the court intended to be transferred would be transferred, due to taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Upon whom would the tax fall? Would it fall upon the spouse making the transfer? If the spouse receiving the transfer paid the tax she would not receive what the court intended. If the spouse who made the transfer paid the tax he would pay more than the court had ordered. In either case the order of the court would be frustrated by the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an important and fundamental principal that on the occasion of a dissolution of marriage there should be no tax payable on transfers, whether they are specifically ordered by the court or are part of the execution of a general order by the court. It is the intention, so to speak, to put the parties into a fictional situation which they would have been in had they been separate up to that time. That is the intention of the law, to my understanding, as it now is in England, and as I hope it will shortly be in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not the intention that there is a passing as on death as there used to be. It is merely an attempt to put the parties into the state they fictionally would have achieved had they lived separate lives up to that point. It can be extremely unfair—and there is no rule of thumb on how it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0930">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>671</span>
can be achieved—what a court will order one spouse to give to another in a given situation. Although, allegedly, there is now no concept of guilt and, therefore, one is not, as it were, fined for being divorced, as was once the case, nevertheless that hankers on in the minds of the judiciary. The property provisions in the Divorce (Scotland) Bill, which is now on the Floor of the House, will have a very different meaning if the Financial Secretary cannot give us an assurance that on the dissolution of marriage this tax will not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt the Treasury will say to itself "The whole country will be flooded with people marrying and divorcing one another in order to transfer property and get out of this tax." I hope that they do. It would be a great boost to the poor old legal profession, which is to be scrutinised under a microscope to discover whether in interpreting the obscenely large number of statutes which are now passed its members earn too much money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But let me give the Treasury this assurance. I have come across very few people who have been divorced to get out of double income tax. I should be surprised if they now started doing it to get out of development land tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reckon that the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) teaches me something new about Scotland every time he speaks. I had not realised that divorce was the equivalent of death, and I hope that that will change, if it has not changed already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He makes the point about the order of the court being frustrated by the tax. I remind him, however—and I am sure that he does not need such a reminder from me—that in a number of circumstances settlements in the court have some tax implications. It has normally been held that the courts themselves take such matters into account in whichever way they wish. It is up to them. In the same way, they will no doubt be aware of the legislation that we shall pass and take that into account in the settlement that they devise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How is the court to be able to take into account the assessment for development land tax when it is a matter for the revenue officials to decide
	<span class='label label-info column'>672</span>
whether one is liable to it according to their own light?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The information will be available to the court as it is to anybody involved in these matters. But I would point out that the court takes into account matters much more difficult to assess. They take into account inflation, for example. But how far one can produce an accurate assessment of such a difficult matter is very doubtful. We are very much aware of the problems of the courts, and the courts themselves are aware of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with the question whether the transfer should be regarded as a gift or whether it should be seen as being for a consideration. This is the kernel of what we are discussing. When there is a breakup of a marriage, money or money's worth passes from the husband, in the case that I cited, to the wife. These matters fall to be considered in examining the provision that will be made for the maintenance of the wife. I do not think one can readily bring to mind a case where a husband, delighted at having divorced his wife, makes a gift in the way that we understand the term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The real question, then, is—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me complete these remarks, and I shall be pleased to give way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is the transfer effectively being made for a consideration or not? I suggest that without doubt, in a vast number of cases, it is given as a consideration. Then the question can firmly be put to me: what is that consideration? The consideration is that if such a transfer had not been made the maintenance payment would itself have been higher. Therefore, there is a choice in a number of cases between making a consideration and having a higher level of maintenance payment. That reveals, to my mind, the nature of the consideration itself, because it is an extension of the maintenance payment, or can be regarded as a commutation of it. That is the situation in the vast majority of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The transfer of the matrimonial home, which is what we are almost always talking about, does not, as I mentioned before, normally give rise to any development value. That is the main practical
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0931">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>673</span>
point to consider. In view of that, I think that these provisions fit quite fairly into the legislation in the way that I have described.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disturbed by the Financial Secretary's view of how divorce occurs in a large number of cases. Contrary to his expectations, if he had practised in the divorce courts, he would know that, oddly enough, when people get divorced a lot of them are perfectly fond of one another but they divorce on the basis that the relationship has broken down and they do not wish to continue being married to each other, or they wish to be married to someone else, or they do not wish to be married to anyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, a large number of settlements, particularly involving property, relate to amicable relationships in which the husband or wife is anxious to make a gift to that person. I have had many cases in which they say "Well, darling, I shall give you such-and-such". That has nothing to do with saying, "And if I do not the court will do it for me". It is because people are civilised enough to treat each other as human beings, though they do not happen to be able to sustain a married relationship. So in a large number of cases, particularly those involving property, it is a question of gift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Financial Secretary speaks of consideration, that is the surmounting fallacy because he will know, I trust, that the provision of the divorce law—or the succession law—entitles a court to make an award of a capital sum and a regular payment. For instance—and this is the fallacy that the Financial Secretary makes—if a bookmaker has capital of £100,000 or shops worth £100,000 and an income of £4,000 a year, the court does not make an award of £50,000 and £1,000 a year and say that if it had not made that award of £50,000 it would make it £2,000 a year because the identical bookmaker next door with an income of £4,000 will have taken from his income an identical regular payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The spouse who does not get the capital payment is not rewarded by a bigger periodical allowance, as it is called. They do not get it because it was not there in the first place; it was not part of the marriage; it was not part of the circumstance and they have not enjoyed any in the meantime. That is why they
	<span class='label label-info column'>674</span>
do not get it. It is not an alternative between capital and revenue. If that is the basis of the Financial Secretary's argument, then it is a false basis because that is not the way upon which the court does it, nor is it the duty of the court to do it, and it is quite wrong to say that the capital consideration is the equivalent of an alternative periodical allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since that is not the consideration, I should like to know what the consideration is. I thought the Financial Secretary would say I rather hoped he would say—that the consideration was freedom, that one gets rid of the woman or man and that is the consideration for which one is paying. That is the consideration in fact. That is the price of divorce. That price does not have to be paid if one does not get divorced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, the consideration is not to get out of the capital payment which would not have to be made if there was no capital; the consideration is the divorce. The Financial Secretary must tell the Committee that the consideration of divorce will be taxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to follow the argument of the Financial Secretary when he said that the consideration for a transfer of property on the dissolution of marriage was the maintenance, that this was in some way a consideration and therefore prevented the transfer from being a gift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider this logically. If a man gives his wife something while they are married and not in consideration of maintenance, then it is all right; it gets the benefit of Clause 10 as a gift. But if the man happens to be responsible for the maintenance of the person to whom that property is given, it is treated as a disposal which is taxable under the Bill. I am sure that the Financial Secretary can see the nonsense of this: if a man gives his mistress the property, although he has no obligation to maintain her, he receives the benefits of Clause 10, whereas if, on the dissolution of marriage, the husband gives the property to the wife in consideration of not having to maintain her for the future, that is a taxable disposal under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Financial Secretary knows that there was a provision in the Finance Act 1975 which exempted from capital transfer tax any transfer which was in consideration of maintenance,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0932">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>675</span>
whether it concerned the wife or the children. I suppose that, if we wanted to take this the whole way, we should have repeated that provision in our amendment. To that extent, the amendment was a probing one to find out whether it was necessary. As I said, I thought that we should be told that it was not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if transfers of property are to be called non-gifts, that is, they are not to be treated as gifts if they are given to someone for whom one has a responsibility for maintenance, at a later stage we had better put down the full provision from the 1975 Act which exempted those transfers from capital transfer tax. It is</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to traverse the ground we have covered on the amendments, but there are two or three small points in comprehending the drafting which I should like to mention before we leave the clause. We do not seem to have many clauses where this sort of thing does not arise, so I hope that the Minister will bear with me if I raise these points. There is also one substantial point which I should like to raise but on which no amendment was tabled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, in terms of comprehensibility and meaning, I refer to lines 18 and 19 on page 13. In talking about the chargeable person's cost of acquisition, the calculation is to include
	<br><blockquote><p>"any incidental costs to the chargeable person of the acquisition of the relevant interest."</p></blockquote>
I assume that that means any costs incidental to the acquisition by the chargeable person of the relevant interest. I wonder why it was put that way. It seems to me that to put
	<br><blockquote><p>"incidental costs to the chargeable person",</p></blockquote>
in that order, may mean that the incidence</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>676</span>
	<p>clearly grossly unfair that they should be treated as a disposal which realises development value which is taxed merely because the donor is responsible for the maintenance of the donee and is treated as buying out that maintenance by the transfer of property.</p>
	<p>If this proposition is not acceptable, we shall certainly put down a clause similar to that in the capital transfer tax provisions to exempt all gifts to persons whom the donor is responsible to maintain.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>applies to the chargeable person and not to the acquisition of the relevant interest. This a small technical drafting point.</p>
	<p>The second of my questions relates to subparagraph (ii) of subsection (2)(	<i>d</i>), at the bottom of page 13 and the top of page 14. Having read paragraphs (i) and (ii) many times, I fail to understand exactly what is added to, subtracted from or qualified to the contents of subsection (2)(	<i>d</i>)(i) by the addition of subparagraph (ii), which merely says that under the same circumstances
	<br><blockquote><p>"… it shall have effect as referring to the like amount in relation to the material disposal"</p></blockquote>
which appears to have been covered in subparagraph (i). Therefore, I should like to know the significance of subparagraph (ii).</p>
	<p>The third question of comprehensibility or intention relates to lines 5, 6 and 7 on page 14 at the end of subsection (2).</p>
	<p>It is stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be assumed for the purposes of this subsection that that day fell (and this Act was in force) before the previous disposal occurred."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>It is curious that, instead of assuming that the previous disposal was deemed to have taken place after the appointed day, one assumes that the appointed day fell on a day other than that which it was. Therefore, I should like to know whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0933">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>677</span>
there is any particular significance in this, either to exclude anything which would have happened if these words had been drafted to make the disposal deemed to have taken place after the appointed day, or was it included, conversely, by deeming the day to have taken place on a date earlier than the day on which it actually fell?</p>
	<p>I hope that that is comprehensible to the Minister. I do not expect him to answer immediately. However, it would be helpful, when considering the meaning of this clause, if we were to have some authoritative comments, particularly on the latter two points.</p>
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>My other point is that as the clause is drafted the benefits of having a transaction treated as a disposal where there has been no acquisition apply where there is a transfer for no consideration but not where the transfer for a small consideration or an under-value, with the two exceptions of charities and exempt bodies for capital transfer purposes. Therefore, it seems that if land is given by a father to a son the son can take over the father's full costs, but if the son pays a nominal amount, or even a substantial amount but very much less than the value itself, for some reason which may not actually relate to the transaction but to the relationship between the two members of the family involved, on any subsequent disposal the son or other person can claim relief only for the amount of the actual consideration passing, even though it may have been a nominal amount.</p>
	<p>I expect that this opportunity of having such a transaction treated as being for no consideration is not available in these circumstances because of some fear of avoidance, but I am not quite clear what it is. I think it would also be useful for us to have the advice of the Minister of State as to what particular loophole it is meant to close.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) on that last point. Having looked and looked again at the clause, I cannot see the logic in distinguishing between a transfer for
	<span class='label label-info column'>678</span>
which there was an under-valuation and one which was given freely. I cannot see the Government's reasoning here, except where, in effect, it compels people such as those we discussed in relation to the amendment about divorce to be treated as having transferred for some consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must say in passing—I think it is in order on this "clause stand part" debate—that I was as astounded as was my right hon. Friend at the Government's reaction in the discussion on the amendment relating to the divorce situation. I had expected that this had been put down as a probing amendment, to which the answer would be that of course there was no intention at all of there being a different liability to tax between people who had been married and had then separated. That seems totally wrong and illogical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would, of course, be unnecessary if, as my hon. Friend has just suggested, we could overcome this peculiar and extraordinary distinction between free gifts and under-valued transfers. In certain circumstances, this could be extremely important to people, where the undervaluation that they had paid was considered to be the basis of the tax. Of course, one could argue that in all these cases base B would apply, but base B could be extremely detrimental as against base A in the computation of many of these taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore support very warmly what has just been said about this distinction. We should like to hear what the Government have to say about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The first point was a drafting one on incidental costs. The hon. Gentleman was concerned that the word "incidental" might refer not to costs but to the particular owner, the chargeable person. I do not know why the draftsman put it that way, but I think it is reasonably clear that they are the incidental costs of the acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point, in relation to subsection (2)(	<i>d</i>)(ii), I confess that I do not know the answer, but I shall write to the hon. Gentleman I think that the Revenue also would prefer to explain it by letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me why lines 4 to 7 on page 14 were included. I asked that question, too, when I looked at the clause. They are to preserve the gift retention if the previous disposal
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0934">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>679</span>
occurred before the appointed day. If the donor's acquisition occurred before the appointed day, unless one assumed that the acquisition had taken place after the appointed day, the gift provisions would not apply to that particular situation. The hon. Gentleman will find that those words have occurred in one or two other clauses where there are exemptions from the legislation. They are to ensure, if something happens before the appointed day, that something else does not happen until after. For instance, where the donor acquired his property before, gave it away after, straddling the appointed day, it is to ensure that the exemption provided by the clause, whether this clause or another clause, is still given and is not lost because one part of the transaction took place before the appointed day and the other took place after.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand exactly why this provision is included in the clause. What I am not clear about is whether there is any difference in saying that for the purposes of this subsection the day shall be assumed to have taken place earlier. Does it carry with it any other implications from what it would have been if it had said that for the purposes of this subsection the disposal took place after the appointed day?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the answer to that. Again, I did not draft those lines. But I do not think that it carries any other implications. No doubt the draftsmen thought that that was the best way of doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was then asked about sales at undervalue. This is a large and difficult area. The principle of the legislation, of course, is that generally we ignore under-value. In other words, if there is a sale at undervalue that is treated as the actual situation and the whole taxation consequences follow, instead of having to inquire why there was an under-valuation, whether it was a collusive sale, or whether it was an under-valuation because one person did not get his figures right or the purchaser got a better deal than the vendor. The principle is that we ignore the undervaluation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, of course, we come to a gift, where there is no consideration at all. There can be a sale for £1 and a gift for no consideration. It was felt that the right way of dealing with gifts was to
	<span class='label label-info column'>680</span>
ignore the gift entirely and merely go back to the original situation, as we have discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to apply that principle to sales at an under-value and ignore them, it would then be necessary, in order to ensure that there was no injustice, to look at every sale at under-value to find out the reasons. Then one comes to the avoidance problem. It would involve a lot of administrative work. As I said, some sales at under-value would be collusive sales, and others would be sales because the parties did not get the value right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There would be all sorts of ramifications and difficulties. That is why we did not apply the gift principle to sales at undervalue, except in the case where there is a transfer of under-value—it would not necessarily be a sale—to a national heritage body, and in another situation which escapes me at the moment—where the transfer was to a charitable body or a national heritage body, where it was unlikely that it would be at under-value for any other reason, and where it would be easy to see the reason for it. In that kind of case, the person disposing of the property is allowed to elect between having it operating under the gift provisions or under the under-valuation provisions. He can choose whichever base cost he wants: whether he wants the transfer price as the base cost, or whether he wants the donor's cost of acquisition as the base cost under the gift proposals. That is the one case in the clause where we depart from the principle that under-valuation is treated differently from gifts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that not also the case within groups of companies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I raise a point on what the Minister has just said? If a father wished to transfer property to a son but would otherwise have to sell the property because he wished to raise some money, and therefore he required from his son some consideration but not the full value, would it be possible under the Bill for a transaction to be arranged between the two parties where the market value of the property was assessed and it was divided in two and a part of it was deemed to be a sale at full market value and the balance deemed to be a gift?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0935">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>681</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. He said that the situation is different within groups of companies where the company does not leave the group. If it leaves the group, there are other provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the very point that creates some difficulty—the sale at an under-value between, for example, father and son. He asked if it were not possible to treat part of it as a proper sale and part as a gift. This happened under the old estate duty regulations. Transfers between connected persons and members of a family were dissected in this way. I would have thought that in practice this causes a great deal of difficulty and administrative problems. But one has to look at the whole transaction and try to dissect which part is sale and which part if gist. This is difficult, and it is to avoid that situation that we say that where there is a sale at under-value the base value to the person who receives the property is dependent on the transfer price and not on the cost of acquisition to the original vendor, if he can be called a vendor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly the Minister is aware of the problem. I agree that there are administrative problems in trying to cope with this, but I think that the onus is upon us to ensure that this example has been properly aired. The problem is, as the Minister has implied that he recognises, that of a son who takes over the full costs that the father had originally passed on to him. The alternative that the father will then have is of going to the market place and selling at full price. Unless some money is exchanged, in these circumstances the father will have no option—in the case of agricultural land this could be quite serious—but to go to the market place and get the full price for the holding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This could cause enormous problems, particularly in the case of agricultural holdings. Clearly, the Minister recognises this, but I do not think that it is good enough to say that, because administrative problems are involved, nothing can be done about it. The hardship that could be created where the base cost is merely the under-valued price that the son pays from the point of view of DLT assessment could cause enormous problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>682</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might not always be the base price. The base price might be the other basis in the valuation discussion. It would not necessarily follow that it is the price of transfer. In the case of agricultural land it might be current use value plus 110 per cent. at the time of disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So although there is a problem, I do not think that it is as great as the hon. Gentleman suggests for the reason that there are separate bases and one can elect between them. It is all very well for the hon. Gentleman to say that we must not worry about the great complexities and difficulties of looking at every case; because, if we were to set out several clauses to deal with the situation, there would be speeches from hon. Gentlemen on the complexities and the cost of adminstering such legislation. This is the problem one has in devising legislation of this kind. That is the Government's problem in introducing the legislation. I am not saying that it is not a self-imposed problem to some extent, but in trying to reach a point of fairness, sometimes one goes too far one way or the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that there is a slight problem, not a major problem, but if we were to depart from the principle that we treat a gift in one way and a sale of under-value subject to the national heritage point and the groups of companies in another way, we should be in greater difficulty and have greater anomalies than exist at the moment. This legislation is an attempt to get away from these anomalies and difficulties. Perhaps that does not satisfy the hon. Gentleman, but I hope that I have at least answered the point raised.

Finally, the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) touched on the marriage point again. I do not want to pursue that point, which was dealt with by the Financial Secretary. The right hon. Member for Crosby is to put down an amendment, but he will realise that if he wants to argue that these transfers on divorce are gifts—they may very well be gifts—and therefore do not fall within this legislation, he must argue that they are gifts for the purposes of capital transfer tax. The right hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. Either they are gifts, or they are not. We have treated them as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0936">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>683</span>
not being gifts, and for that reason they do not come under this particular provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that basis I was accepting the Government's argument that these are not gifts, and therefore, we need a specific exclusion in the Bill—which is what I said I would introduce later. If that is accepted—that they are not gifts, but they are paid to somebody for whom one is responsible for maintenance—we had better except them and exclude them from the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If they are not gifts, they are payable for some kind of consideration. They are either gifts, or they are not. If they are not, they are payable for consideration and, therefore, taxable, as they are under the Bill. If, on the other hand, they are gifts, they are chargeable to capital transfer tax. The CTT legislation recognises that the reality of the situation is that they are not gifts. That is why we have Section 46 in the 1965 Finance Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not have it in here, too?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because they are not gifts they are transfers of consideration, but there are two other kinds of transfers.

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I argue the amendment perhaps I may thank my hon. Friend the Minister for the reply that he sent me after I had advised him that I was proposing to put down this amendment and asking him for his comments and, if possible, his blessing. His reply, sent to me very promptly, was, as usual, most courteous and, as usual, well reasoned, but I regret to say that he was reluctant to give his blessing to it. Perhaps he will change his mind. Time alone will tell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My purpose in putting down the amendment was to point out that I felt there was a degree of illogicality here which was quite out of character for my hon. Friend. Clause 11(1)(	<i>a</i>) exempts from development land tax a local authority as defined under the Community Land Act, but it does not exempt the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0938">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>687</span>
superannuation fund of such a local authority. In all other tax legislation local authorities are exempt from taxes, and so are their superannuation funds. We have this situation with income tax. We have it with corporation tax. We have it with capital gains tax and with VAT. To come nearer to the mark, we had it, and still have it, with development gains tax. To go back into history, we had it with the betterment levy in the Land Commission Act. So why not have it with this legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will no doubt say that this is a new tax, which will import new rules, but it does seem to me illogical. He may also say that to concede this would be to concede it for all pension funds, and he may well be right because Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 and New Clauses 1 and 3, seek to examine private pension funds. However, we can draw a clear distinction. Private pension funds are, in effect, voluntary. The setting up of a superannuation fund by a local authority is a statutory duty imposed on a local authority. It is in no way voluntary; it is mandatory. Therefore, not only does it not open Pandora's Box by permitting this amendment, but it seems illogical not to permit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend will be aware that there is a duty upon local authorities to make good any deficiency in a superannuation fund, if necessary out of the rates. It seems illogical that land allocated for one purpose—namely, for a superannuation fund—should be treated differently from other land held by the same corporation, no doubt in the same name. I believe that local authorities hold all their assets in the name of the local authority. If a local authority has to dispose of land, perhaps to meet a deficiency in a pension fund, although the land is not appropriated for the pension fund, it does not have to pay the tax, whereas if it were selling land which had been appropriated for a pension fund it would have to pay the tax. In those circumstances, I wonder whether my hon. Friend would reconsider his courteous refusal. If he objects to the amendment on the grounds of inferior draftsmanship, I should be happy to let him take it away and redraft it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I believe that amendments Nos. 84, 85 and New Clauses 1 and 3 are bracketed together with Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>688</span>
No. 134 for consideration, and I should like to refer to those.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may first explain the effect of the two amendments. They have the effect of exempting pension funds from the charge of development land tax. New Clauses 1 and 3, on the other hand, have the effect of putting pension funds in the same position as churches and charities. Our preferred position is that pension funds should be totally exempt, but if that argument does not win the day the secondary and alternative position is that at the very least they should have the same preferential treatment as is accorded to churches and charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may deal with the submissions of the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett). He chides his hon. Friend the Minister with illogicality, but as I trust that we shall have his support in a moment or two I hope he will forgive me if I say that the illogicality is his. The illogicality is his if he fails to join us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no distinction between the position of a local authority employee in respect of his pension as against, for instance, that of a miner in respect of his pension. If a miner's pension is to be free of development land tax, I concede immediately that the local authority employee's pension should be free of DLT. There can be no reason, either in law or equity, why the local authority employee should in any way be put in a preferential position with regard to his pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it would be illogical, Parliament may decide that certain people in society should be put in a preferential position in regard to their pensions. In another age, for instance—say during the era of strong support for the Church of England in early Victorian times—there might have been support in Parliament for giving the clergy a preferential position in relation to a pension fund, because even in those days some of them were very poor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, local authority employees are now among the best paid people in the country. Indeed, there is a strong market augument for saying that they are too well paid and perhaps they should be less well paid to force them out of that employment. The hon. Gentleman has to come towards us and say quite firmly that if he is in favour of any kind of exemption for the pension funds of local
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0939">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>689</span>
government employees he is in favour of exemption across the whole broad basis of all pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position of pension funds is so important, both in society as a whole and in the economy, that I ought in fairness to them tell the Committee and put on record what their position is. The National Association of Pension Funds has more than 60,000 pension schemes which benefit 12 million members, and those 12 million do not include the dependents of persons who are potential pensioners. Of those 12 million, about 2 million are now in receipt of pensions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, the NAPF made a submission to the Treasury in June 1974 concerning development gains tax. At that time, the fund asserted that its total administered funds were about 12,000 million, and no doubt they have grown substantially since then. It asserted that the amount invested in property was about £4,000 million, and again no doubt that figure has increased since June 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way in which the fund invests its funds is widely known. About a third is invested in property, about a third in equities and a third is held in various forms of fixed-interest investment—to a large extent in gilts. Therefore, its investment in pension funds on behalf of its potential pensioners is a very important matter to a large number of our fellow citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The historical position since 1921 has been that the funds of the pension fund have been free of tax. I think that has been so for two main reasons: first, because Parliament has decided that the private provision of pensions is a socially desirable objective which should be smiled upon by Parliament and be given a helping hand by making it tax free. But the second, even more cogent, argument, because it does not rely just upon the fleeting transitory smile of Parliament and political beliefs, is the idea that receipts from the pension funds are ultimately taxed in the hands of the pensioners, and therefore to tax those funds initially also in the hands of the pension fund would be to impose double taxation on that same fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must have been those two arguments, and I am sure that it would not have been just a matter of no political urgency or expediency, that persuaded the Labour Government in the Finance Act 1974 not
	<span class='label label-info column'>690</span>
to impose development gains tax upon the pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, the original proposal was that pension funds should be subject to development gains tax. Those concerned made their representations which were, in substance, the same representations that I now make, and they were relieved of tax. I thought that the hon. Member for Nottingham, East, (Mr. Dunnett) would wish to join us today in the same, logical attitude which his party took up between February and October 1974. That is the historical argument which has always been put forward on behalf of pension funds. But there is a special argument which relates to pension funds today. Their liabilities to their pensioners are decided not only by reference to the contributions made by individual pensioners. The liabilities to pensioners are also often based upon either the current level of wages at the time that a pension is paid or upon the current level of inflation, again at the time that a pension is paid, or a combination of both. Pension funds are at present in a difficult position. They must cope with what is, by any standards, a high rate of inflation. They had to cope with a 26 per cent. rate of inflation last year, and it is arguable whether they will need to cope with a rate of inflation varying between 9 per cent. and 13 per cent. this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such rates of inflation were not envisaged by those who set up pension funds. They must also deal—and I am sure that it was not envisaged by them—with the effect of price control and, more particularly, dividend control. That makes it difficult for them to see how they can meet their liabilities. Thus if exemption is not given to them, or if the secondary position for which I argue—namely, that they should be given the same status as churches and charities—is not granted to them, a number of important consequences will follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, existing wage earners will need to make higher contributions. The Government argue that it is the increase in wages which is causing inflation. I would not wish to say anything about that argument. That is the Government's argument. If that is true, is it not clear that increasing contributions from existing wage earners to pension funds will mean increased pressure for higher wages?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0940">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>691</span>
Even were I wrong about that, it is plain that, if the Government do not exempt pension funds or grant them a preferential position, the consequence will be that they will have a reduced sum available for new investment and, in particular, for investment in the present Government's preferred area—manufacturing industry. It is a matter of fact that pension funds are the most important investors in the economy at present. The Government are at last beginning to understand that there is not an unlimited supply of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the money from pension funds must go towards funding these increased liabilities to their pensioners, money will not be available for investment, even if there is the profit to attract such investment. Even if a future Government have second thoughts about dividend control or price control, the money will still not be available for the investment that the Government so badly want. From every point of view the Government should reconsider their attitude towards pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I dare say that the Government fear that if the pension funds were given a special position in the property market, there would be a risk that the market in property would be distorted in favour of the pension funds. If that were the Government's fear, I ask the rhetorical question: why was a preferential position given to the churches and the charities? The churches, particularly the Church of England, have always been holders of a large amount of property. I do not pretend to know what is the portfolio of the Church of England, but I believe that the Church Commissioners hold a large proportion of their assets in property. If that is so, why were they given a special position?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that, a special position having been extended to the churches and charities, from every point of view, at the very least—I am not arguing for this first of all—the same position should be extended to the pension funds. This is not an argument for the big battalions in the City of London. It is certainly not an argument for the CBI or any of those bodies. The pension funds are only trustees, and most of all they are trustees for 12 million of the ordinary working people of this country whose security and hope for the future is based upon pension funds. We are playing with the
	<span class='label label-info column'>692</span>
future of many of our fellow citizens, and good sense, equity, and a desire for a future prosperous country demands on every hand that we should give the pension funds a special position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), I have a great deal of sympathy with Amendment No. 134 moved by the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett), but, again like my hon. Friend, I think that it is too restrictive. Like my hon. Friend, I draw no distinction in practice between the superannuation funds of a local authority and those of ICI. Whereas it may be argued that the superannuation fund of ICI is not mandatory on ICI, it is certainly mandatory on the ICI employees. Therefore, the effect in practice is the same as regards the contributors to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like other members of the Committee, I have seen a copy of the letter from the Chairman of the Investment Protection Committee of the National Association of Pension Funds to the Minister of State, dated 27th November last year, since which time, I understand, the position for pension funds has not changed—that is, the Government have made no move whatever towards meeting the representations made in that letter, despite their long, detailed and, I suggest, meritorous nature. I suppose that we should not be entirely surprised about that, as the Government made no move to help pension funds under the community land scheme either, despite the considerable representations made by the Opposition during the Committee proceedings of that Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Government made some progress in respect of charities on the community land scheme, and we shall doubtless say more about that when we deal with Amendment No. 86, which is not linked with the amendment under discussion, they did nothing whatever to help pension funds. I quote from the letter to which I referred, because I consider it important. The chairman, Mr. Lander, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The imposition of this tax"—</p></blockquote>
he is referring to DLT—
	<br><blockquote><p>"on pension fund trustees will result in a progressive depreciation of the property assets they hold … The consequence will be, at least, reduced resources available for reinvestment in the employing industry, with all that entails for the trustees
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0941">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>693</span>
and everyone else, and, at worst, increases in the costs of goods and services (more per ton of steel, more per unit of electricity, more per therm of gas, etc.) thus further fuelling inflation.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Government spokesmen in the debates on the Land Scheme so far have not disputed the mechanism by which this depreciation of assets will occur, i.e., that the tax will take away that increment of value in each case due to the land's potential for development or re-development. Indeed the recognition that an exemption is needed for property investments held by charities at the White Paper Day involves an express acceptance that that depreciation will occur".</p></blockquote>
That is plainly so. That is why the Government made a concession for charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mr. Lander goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The only answer the pension funds have received so far is an assertion that the amount of the depreciation on their assets will be small, because it is said the properties they hold are not of the type which will be affected".</p></blockquote>
I have yet to be convinced by that argument—that the properties are not of the type to be affected. But even if that were to be so, it still fails to deal with the extremely objectionable principle of imposing a tax on such a basic social purpose as a pension fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many years ago it could be fairly said that some people in the Labour Party, perhaps even the late Mr. Richard Crossman in the middle 1950s, felt that the proper form of evolution of occupational pensions was that they should evolve out of sight altogether and that the State should take over the rôle. Indeed, Mr. Crossman produced a policy document in 1957 which more or less said that. But times change and eventually that policy was abandoned. Now the feeling is unanimous among all people involved in politics that the occupational pensions have an essential rôle to play as part of our social security system amd anything which damages them or reduces their efficiency is strongly to be resisted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I find it difficult to draw any effective distinction between the rôle of the charities and the rôle of the pension funds. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West has courageously argued that there is no reason why one should exempt charities from the community land scheme. I remember him arguing that on the Floor of the House, and in Committee. But he was arguing it as part of a general feeling that dispensations of this sort were unsatisfactory and that one was creating super citizens who were outside the law.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>694</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Privileged.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept my hon. Friend's correction—privileged citizens—in the literal sense of the word "privilege", Mr. Crawshaw, privilege, a private law—with their own arrangements for dealing with matters of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Government, having arrived at the present position by which there are some, I believe unsatisfactory, concessions for charities but none for pension funds, we are likely to arrive at the sort of nonsenses which Mr. Lander refers to again in his letter. He says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Other distinctions exist which appear technical in the extreme. Thus a trust to provide retirement benefits for all railwaymen in Great Britain will probably be a charity, but a trust for all employees of British Rail would not. What possible justification can there be for a difference of treatment between an investment made on behalf of the trust that happens to satisfy the definition of charity in that it provides benefits for the persons beyond a specified age in a particular area, and a trust set up to provide similar benefits for work-people in a nationwide industry like, say, the British Rail, or ICE".</p></blockquote>
Both British Rail and ICI have pension funds, and both will be affected by the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have sought to argue that the trouble with pension funds is that they are too commercial. Indeed, the former Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, on 12th November last year, said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is far better that investment takes place in manufacturing industry and not in speculative ventures as it has done in the past. If the Bill"—</p></blockquote>
he meant the Community Land Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"goes some way towards redirecting pension funds into manufacturing industry, it will have a spin-off which will benefit the country [OFFICIAL REPORT, 12th November 1975; Vol. 899, c. 1468.]</p></blockquote>
So there was a clear distinction in his mind—which I suspect is in the mind of the Minister and the Government as a whole—that in some way investment in industry is good and investment in property is automatically wrong. This is an obviously superficial distinction, first, because a good deal of the property investment is essential for manufacturing industry anyway as it involves the development of factories, warehouses, laboratories or similar things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even the so-called commercial clement of property investment, such as shops and offices, clearly cannot he readily separated from categories of industrial investment, such as factories, because the factories
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0942">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>695</span>
make the goods which are sold in the shops, both of which provide employment for people. The idea that the shopping centre and the investment which the pension fund puts into it is an unlaudable and unpraiseworthy activity, whereas the industrial estate which provides goods in manufacturing industry is laudable and satisfactory is ludicrous, since both are providing jobs and services for people as part of our modern industrial society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is in the Government's mind—it manifestly was in the Under-Secretary's remark which I have just quoted—that the pension funds are too involved in commercial activity and that not enough of their money is being directed towards manufacturing industry and, therefore, 	<i>a fortiori,</i> they should pay development land tax in order to ensure that less of their money goes into property investment, is unreasonable and superficial and takes no account of the realities of a modern society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to think about this again. We had an extremely long debate in the Committee stage of the Community Land Bill, which we shall doubtless refer to again shortly, on the subject of charities. Eventually the Government made a concession. I do not think that it was a satisfactory concession. But they made no concession about the community land scheme and pension funds, and they have made no concession this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot understand why the Government want to take away from these organisations, which are providing such an essential service to 12 million of our fellow citizens, an important part of the profits which they make from their commercial activities which do not line the pockets of wealthy shareholders but provide pensions for working men who put in their savings weekly. Surely this is a matter on which we should not be divided in any way, and the Government should be prepared to make a concession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Perhaps I should not deal with Amendment No. 134 until he comes to the Committee. I will go on to the other amendments and come back to the point that he raised. The point is one of substance in principle even under his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument so ably put by the hon. Gentleman is that pension funds should be exempt from development land tax. They have always been exempt from all kinds of taxes, with one exception which I shall come to later. Therefore, they should be exempt from development land tax. The argument is that pension funds are good. They help the community and people in general, because they invest their money to produce pensions. I do not seek to dissent at all from that assertion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one should get this matter into perspective. Pension funds are not the only body that serves the community. They are not the only body that helps people. Despite the fact that they are extremely beneficial to many people, they benefit only a section of the community. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) gave a figure of 12 million. But I, too, have been looking at figures. My figures do not go further than 1971, but they are figures produced by the Government Actuary on occupational pension schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These figures are quite interesting. Of course, the percentages may have increased since 1971, although not to a considerable extent. The figures show that, whereas
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0943">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>697</span>
pension funds help vast groups of people, they do not help everybody in the community. Not everybody is a member of an occupational pension scheme. To get the whole basis of this legislation into perspective I think it is only right to make this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government Actuary's figures for 1971 show that at that time 49 per cent. of employed members of society were members of pension schemes It may have gone over 50 per cent. since then—I do not know. If we break down that 49 per cent., 62 per cent. of male workers and only 28 per cent. of female workers were members of pension schemes. I do not criticise pension funds. It is in the nature of things no doubt. I merely make the point on those figures because there are many people who will not benefit from the very substantial and generally good investments made by pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one goes a step further and looks at the private sector, one finds that according to the Government Actuary's figures for 1971 61 per cent. of non-manual workers and only 35 per cent. of manual workers were members of pension schemes. Therefore, at that time most members of pension schemes were men who were non-manual workers. There is nothing wrong with that, except that it again shows that, although pension funds have made great advances, there are vast numbers of people who do not get the benefit of these tax-free investments made by pension. funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That point has to be made, because we are concerned here with a development land tax the objective of which is, however much the Opposition may not like it, to restore to the community most of the benefit arising from the betterment following planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the one hand we have the principle of the legislation—it may not work in practice; these matters are difficult to operate—that most of the benefit arising from betterment or development should be returned to the community at large. We believe that the best vehicle for returning that benefit to the community is the local authority. The Opposition may disagree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But does the Minister agree—here I take up a point made by the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column'>698</span>
Dunnett)—that whatever the position in 1971, we are now moving to a position where membership of a pension scheme is not a voluntary matter? Everybody in future will have to belong either to an approved private scheme or subscribe to the fall-back State scheme. A different situation is, therefore, in prospect from that which obtained in 1971.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are moving to a different situation, although we are moving into a situation where people on higher incomes are able to make greater contributions, and thereby get greater benefits, and people on lower incomes get smaller benefits because they are unable to make greater contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that we are moving into a different situation, but the figures are there. Pension funds do not benefit everybody in the community, and the Government believe that the whole philosophy of the legislation is that we should return, as best we can, most of the benefit from betterment, from planning—from development if one wishes to call it that—to the community at large. The best way of doing that is by returning it through the vehicle of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Gentlemen opposite may say that that is not very good either because local authorities do not represent the community in practice, that they do not listen to peoples' view and that generally they are not particularly democratic bodies, and so on but that criticisim can he made of any democratic body. The fact is that they are the best democratic vehicle that we have on a local basis by which we can return most of this betterment profit created by the community to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to accede to these amendments we would be saying that some of that profit, if the land is owned by a pension fund, should be returned not to the community in general but to the members of that pension fund, be it the National Union of Mineworkers pension fund, the Church of England pension fund, the ICI pension fund, or any other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me give an example, and no doubt hon. Members have had similar examples in their constituency. My local authority wanted to buy some land to build a school. That land would cost a substantial amount of money because of planning permission. If the local authority bought the land under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0944">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>699</span>
this legislation—forgetting the Community Land Act which has not come into operation—in effect the owner would get 20 per cent.—he would get more due to exemption, but I shall keep it simple—and the local authority would get 80 per cent. The 20 per cent. would represent the cost that the local authority would incur in buying that land. It would get the land much more cheaply because of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other, if that land was owned by the ICI pension fund, the National Union of Mineworkers pension fund, the retired stockbrokers pension fund, or whatever, the local authority would pay the full 100 per cent. for the land and the benefit of that 80 per cent. would go to the pension fund, not to the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a clash, therefore, between the local community which requires land for schools, hospitals and housing at the lowest possible price to benefit the community, and a private organisation, or semi-private organisation—not in a pejorative sense—which benefits its own members, however desirable and good that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government do not think it is right that we should give that benefit to the pension fund, despite the fact that the pension fund is benefiting a group of people. We see this legislation as intended to benefit a larger group, the community as a whole—people who are not members of that pension fund; who do not have the benefit of belonging to the pension fund that happens to own the piece of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that if we did that it would increase costs, that subscriptions to pension funds would rise, and that wages would have to go up. I too, can use that argument. If we exempt pension funds and local authorities have to pay more for the land, which they would if they bought from pension funds, that will put up costs. It will increase rates, and all sorts of costs, because the cost of buying land for housing and for schools by the local authority will be increased, and that will have its ramifications in the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot, therefore, agree with that argument, because in either case it can be argued that costs are increased. The basis of the legislation is that we believe we should return that benefit to the community at large through the local
	<span class='label label-info column'>700</span>
authority, and not through a private or semi-private institutions such as the pension funds, although they are no doubt very worthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the second point, that, so it. is said and as the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) said, we are doing great damage to pension fund investments because we are striking at the heart of some of their property investment. I remind him that most pension funds, in the main, invest for income. No doubt they invest for capital growth as well, but most prudent pension fund managers, especially after the experience of the last few years, invest for a steady rental income if they are investing in property, plus, of course, the hope that their investment will increase in value to take into account the fall in the value of money through inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be the exception for a pension fund to seek to invest in property for the sake of the betterment of the development value. I know that it has been done: there have been one or two well-publicised cases, there was a case where a pension fund invested, not for capital growth, not for the income return, but for a "hope" value or a profit. I do not criticise the fund. That is how the market operates, and that is the situation in which the fund was operating. It had a perfect right to maximise its profit. If those were the rules, the fund played within them. We should change the rules if we do not like them, and that is what we are trying to do. But I suggest that such a venture is not the venture ordinarily undertaken by a pension fund, and, if a pension fund undertakes such a venture and makes a large profit, there is no reason, under the Bill, why it should not pay tax on that profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall return to the tax point later, but may I quote from one of the many publications dealing with land and property—	<i>Property Investor,</i> I am not sure who publishes it, but it is a fairly reputable magazine or brochure. It states: "The most worrying feature of all, from the point of view of public confidence and of safeguarding the future pension rights of the workers whose contributions are being invested, is that far too little is known about the activities of most pension funds." I make no comment on that. "It should go without saying that pension funds should invest in prime properties that guarantee a secure income and perhaps
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0945">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>701</span>
capital growth that will keep pace with inflation."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the main, I should have thought, a prudent manager of a pension fund, investing in property, should seek, as the article says—it was written by experts—a guarantee of secure income and perhaps capital growth that will keep pace with inflation. Such capital growth is not a betterment profit or a development profit. That is quite separate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article goes on: "In practice, many funds are invested in highly dubious secondary situations of the kind that have already caused many private property companies considerable losses."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely that over the past few years, many pension funds, harassed by inflation, seeing that a quick profit could be made from property, did invest in property in the hope of getting a betterment profit and paying no tax upon it. We say that that is not right. It is not the major function of pension funds. Their major function is to ensure a rental income, not to engage in speculation. If they go into that kind of extraordinary, profit-taking situation, they should pay the tax, because the object of the tax is to return the benefit to the community and not to a particular section, however praiseworthy in the case of a pension fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third point relates to taxation. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that since 1921 or 1924 pension funds have been exempt from tax. They have been exempt, in the main, from income tax on their investment income and from capital gains tax on their capital profits. The main reason for that is that they have to switch their investments from time to time, to preserve the value of their investments, and because of that it was felt that capital gains tax should not apply. Some people would argue that it should, but I think that that was the reason it did not apply. For the purposes, therefore, of capital gains tax, income tax or corporation tax on their investment income, they are completely exempt from tax. Also, subscriptions to the pension fund are usually deductible in computing tax. So they have this enormous tax benefit at the moment, a tax benefit designed to ensure that they get a good flow of income and that they can keep up with capital growth because capital gains tax is not imposed upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>702</span>
8.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, of course, one area which hon. Gentlemen sometimes forget where pension funds would be taxable. That is if they engage in trading. There is nothing in the fiscal legislation of this country exempting them from tax in those circumstances. If a pension fund were to buy, say, some copper on the London Metal Exchange, keep it for a while and then sell it, buying it with the object of making a profit because copper does not make any income, it would pay income tax on the profits. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but if it is a trading venture—I am postulating that it is—a pension fund is taxable on its trading profits and always has been. It is exempt from capital gains tax on investment income. It has never been exempt on trading profit. I accept that it may never engage in trading, but if it did it would be taxable on its trading profits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Only if it were persistently trading in copper, not for a one-off transaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask hon. Gentlemen what is the difference between a pension fund which buys a lot of copper on the London Metal Exchange to sell at a profit because the value of sterling falls and the price of copper rises, and a pension fund which buys a green field site which is worth nothing more than the grazing income it produces, perhaps grazing a few cows on it just to show that it is interested in an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0946">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>703</span>
income coming in, but buying that green field site hoping, and perhaps knowing, that the local authority will grant planning permission? The local authority grants planning permission and the pension fund makes a vast profit on selling it. What is the difference between that situation and the other situation of a venture in the nature of trade? I suggest that in practice and in principle there is very little difference.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is the Minister's view, what is the difference in investing in oil believing that it may be found in the North Sea, getting some piffling interest rate on the investment and then selling the shares later? There does not seem to me to be any difference there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into all the ramifications of what is or is not an investment and how one taxes an investment. The point that I am making is a fairly obvious one, I should have thought. I am not saying that every case of a pension fund buying land is a case of a pension fund wanting to make a development profit, but there are cases, there have been cases, and there will be cases in the future, where they will or could make a betterment profit. Why should they be exempt under this legislation when other organisations have to pay the tax?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned in this case, not with the normal investment of pension funds, but with something quite different, something speculative, buying on a hope value in many cases. Why should they be exempt from tax, bearing in mind that in our view—hon. Gentlemen opposite may not accept this—that profit created by the community should go back to the community? A pension fund, whosesoever pension fund it may be, is not the community. It is a private organisation. It may be helping a lot of people, but it is a private body and a private group of people. We do not see why pension funds should have that particular privilege and benefit. On all the other taxation provisions, they are completely exempt from tax and will remain so, but in this one case we do not see why they should be exempt, because this tax is different in nature. My contention would be that it is much closer to a trading situation when a pension fund buys in the hope of making a betterment profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I return to the point about charities. I was asked why charities were
	<span class='label label-info column'>704</span>
treated differently. Again, it is because charities are different. Charities lie, as it were, in between. On the one hand, there is the local authority which serves the community generally, or at least the local community. The pension fund, on the other hand, serves the employees of a particular industry. The charity very often lies somewhere in between. The example was given by the hon. Gentleman of a charity for the benefit of all railway workers. I am not sure whether that would be a charity, but if it were for poor railway workers it might be considered a charity. Whether it was just for the benefit of railway workers I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All railwaymen are poor, are they not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The law is not as wise sometimes as politicians in defining "poor". Leaving that aside, the hon. Gentleman gave the kind of example where a charity serves a wider community than a pension fund. The main difference in the case of charities is that for so many charities—churches especially—their land and their property is part of their existence. A church has a church. It does not have an investment in a church. The Church of England pension fund may have investments, and that is our difficulty; that is the anomaly. But a church is a church; that is all it has. The church is not investing in land in order to get a return. It was felt that because it was in that situation, because its property is not an investment, the Church of England's property in churches is not an investment in the sense of an investment to produce income, it is the very reason for its existence as a charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, charities fall somewhere in between—local authorities, on the one hand, and pension funds, on the other. So we provided another approach for charities because so many of them have owned land for the benefit of carrying out their particular operations, whereas pension funds own land and invest in land for the income and the profits they can make out of it. That is a different situation from that of a charity, especially a church. That is why we have drawn a distinction between charities and pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return now to my hon. Friend's Amendment No. 134, as I deferred discussion of it until he returned. I think he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0947">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>705</span>
will accept that I could not go along with his amendment. He will realise that, if we were to accept it we would have to go further and exempt all pension funds. Despite the fact that local authorities have a statutory obligation, there may be other organisations with statutory obligations. I do not think that is the crucial argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities can buy land under the development land tax free of tax when they operate as local authorities under their duty as local authorities. But when their pension funds—I should have thought that in practice they would keep their pension funds separate from other operations—buy land they are in no different position than companies' and nationalised industries' pension funds. I do not think that we could give an exemption in one case without giving it in other cases. The two situations are quite different; the local authority operating as a local authority and the local authority pension fund investing employees' contributions in order to maximise the employees' pensions. That is a separate function no different from that of ICI, the National Union of Mineworkers or any other pension fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to disappoint hon. Gentlemen. I cannot go along with them for the reasons I have given. It would not be fair to give this exemption to one particular body, however worthy it may be, because the object of the legislation is to return this large profit to the community. Pension funds and their employees are part of the community but they are not the whole of the community. I have not the right to give them this benefit while denying it to most people in the local community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make clear that there are three groups of amendments here. The Minister has addressed his remarks mainly to that group which gives complete exemption to pension funds. There are three groups. An amendment was moved by the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) on the ground that local authorities have a statutory obligation to provide pension funds and therefore come in line with other statutory bodies mentioned in Clause 11. I do not see the distinction between that and other pension funds. I can see the technical distinction but it is not a distinction of any substance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second group of amendments—Nos. 84, 85 and new Clause 3—which
	<span class='label label-info column'>706</span>
would exempt pension funds altogether, are alternatives to amendments in the new clause, merely putting the exemption in different forms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 1 would bring pension funds in line with provisions in the Bill for charities. We hope that the provisions about charities will be altered and that we shall get complete exemption for them. But while we are debating the exemption for pension funds, with a partial exemption in the Bill for charities, it is difficult for the Minister to deny the same exemption to pension funds. They are, after all, as has been said during the course of the debate on these amendments, providing much the same service to the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of our debates on the Community Land Bill, we persuaded the Minister in charge of that Bill to say that the charities were providing a service which would need to be provided by the State if churches and charities did not provide it, and therefore they were entitled to some exemption. He did not give them sufficient exemption. That insufficiency has been repeated in this Bill. Pension funds provide a community service, a social service and an essential service, which the Government would need to provide out of taxpayers' money were they not doing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a mass of correspondence in front of me from various sources—from those who are experienced in running pension funds and from firms and large undertakings which run pension funds—which see serious damage to those funds if this Bill is allowed to go through as drafted, with development land tax being imposed on—I use the phrase the Minister used—"switching their investments".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a letter here from the chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds Land Sub-Committee. He says, and, after all, he is extremely experienced—
	<br><blockquote><p>"The great majority of Pension Funds have never engaged in buying land with a view to making a profit by selling on after planning consent had been granted and, even if it were not for the Community Land Scheme, they would have no intention of engaging in this sort of activity. This is not so much a moral question as one which follows from the obligation of Pension Fund Trustees to make the best of their assets for their members, and their members' dependants. Pension Fund Trustees have an exemption from income tax for investments only; the sort of speculative activity referred to would be treated as 'dealing', and any profits made subject to income tax."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0948">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>707</span>
I want to stress that. The Minister made great play of it. According to his quotation from the magazine 	<i>Property Investor,</i> far too little is known about the investments of pension funds. I cannot for the life of me see how any financial journalist could have said that. One could easily find out about the investment of pension funds, which have been extremely frank and open. In fact, they have been extremely frank and open to us on this side of the Committee in putting their case on the form of investment which they have. The statement that some of them invested in highly dubious secondary—I lost the track of the Minister then—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall repeat it. It is not my phrase. This is a reputable and highly respected investment review, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In practice, many funds are invested in highly dubious secondary situations of the kind that have already caused many private property companies considerable losses."</p></blockquote>
I think that was probably the case, especially in 1973–74.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then I ask the Minister whether they would be taxed as dealing in property if they deliberately buy property to resell at a profit. It would be trading or dealing, and that is not what pension funds do. Were they to do that, they would be caught under other provisions for taxation. Apart from that, they are relieved of tax. I am sure that if he refers to any of the reputable pension funds, without referring to what he calls a reputable and highly respected journalist—who would not be respected by me when he writes that sort of thing—he will find a far better picture of how the pension funds collected and accumulated are invested. The actual amount invested in pension funds is something like £1,500 million, and a great proportion of that in property itself. Perhaps one could pick out one or two black sheep, but it is the job of the Inland Revenue to tax them as trading in property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the type of pension fund which we seek to exempt from Development land tax. The reputable pension funds are certainly very concerned with the effect that this tax will have on their funds. The Minister rightly said that
	<span class='label label-info column'>708</span>
pension funds are exempt from most other taxes. He referred to pension funds as "goodies", rather sarcastically, I thought. They certainly are "goodies" in that they provide a helpful community service. I do not think that he dissents from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that they are not the only bodies to provide such a service. Neither are local authorities, the Commission for the New Towns, The Highlands and Islands Development Board, the Lee Valley Regional Park Authority. Are these authorities which provide benefits for everybody? They are exempt. The Minister's argument that pension funds do not provide a service for everybody falls to the ground.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not a difference between geographical universality and occupational universality? It appears that the hon. Gentleman is trying to confuse the two.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite see the distinction which the hon. Gentleman wishes to make. Is there geographical universality in the Scottish Development Agency? It is true it may apply to Scotland, but it applies only to development schemes in Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Highland and Islands Development Board, which covers an area in terms of population of nearly 1 million, assisted 3,000 last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed, 3,000 out of the population of Scotland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, only 1 million of the whole of the population of Scotland. Its purpose is to serve the whole of that population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Occupational pensions are open to all employees in many major firms. To say that they serve only a proportion of the public is not to say that they do not provide a community service. The Minister quoted some figures to show the proportions of male manual and non-manual workers in occupational pension schemes. It is not a question of how many are in these schemes but whether the schemes provide a service similar to the type of service provided by local authorities. Local authorities do not provide universal benefits to everybody.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0949">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>709</span>
Many of the social benefits provided in this country are provided by the central Government and not by local government. One might say that local government ought not to be exempt from this tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that this tax is intended to take away from the owner of property a betterment which has been created by the community. If there is a body which is providing a community service, then it should not be taxed and some of its assets through which it is providing that service should not be taken away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where I take issue with the Minister is that he referred all the time in his argument to a provision for the community in general, the community at large. I should not have thought that that was the right principle on which to deal with the Bill. I have always understood that the benefit of the tax should go back for the purpose of serving the community, not merely go back to the body, the local authority, which the hon. Gentleman said was the body which provided community services at large.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, the hon. Gentleman cannot possibly support the list of bodies set out in Clause 11(2), to which I have just referred. They are bodies which are providing certain benefits, but not universally throughout the country, or even universally in any particular geographical area. The argument which I had hoped the Minister would use was that a body which was providing community service should not suffer the tax. It should not be asked to pay part of its assets over in general to a local authority. It should be entitled to manage its affairs so that it does its best for those who invest in it. After all, there are 12 million investors in private pension funds. Those 12 million are just the heads of families. That number does not include all who benefit. If we were to increase that number by two and a half, or three, or even more, we should get the figure of those who benefit through the private funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Life Offices' Association wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 16th March and said that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the fact that property held in a private pension fund or in the pension business fund of an insurance company will be subject to development land tax, contrary to the long standing principle that pension funds are accumulated free of tax. It would also appear inequitable to levy development land tax on development undertaken within these funds bearing in mind that the benefits will accrue
	<span class='label label-info column'>710</span>
to pensioners who form a substantial part of the community".</p></blockquote>
That is the basis on which we argue the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it being suggested that pensioners as a whole benefit from the organisation which wrote the letter, or is the right hon. Gentleman merely saying that it applies to those lucky pensioners who are able to take advantage by investing?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They do to this extent, that a person who joins an occupational pension fund receives the benefits from that fund. Most of the occupational pension funds are open to employees in the concern in which they are employed. As our legislation is progressing at present, employees may well be obliged to join those occupational pension funds. There is the statutory obligation, very much the same as for local authorities, for which the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) has pleaded, which obliges bodies to set up pension funds. If those pension funds are to be reduced in capacity, if they are to be deprived of some of their assets from which they provide the benefits, they will not be able to take on so many pensioners, and that number will be thrown on to the State pension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that if this tax is applied over a period of years, the pension funds will be reduced and pensioners will suffer. I must read a paragraph—because it is a constituency matter—from a letter that I have received from the Littlewoods organisation. Whatever one may think of Littlewoods and what it runs—be it mail order, stores or pools—it is a very big organisation, and it has a very large sum of money at its disposal for its employees and to support their pensions. It tells me that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect of this new tax will be that the substantial investment in property by pension funds will not make as large a contribution as expected to the provision of retirement benefits to employees and, inevitably, this shortfall will need to be made good not only by the companies providing these retirement benefits but, in the long run, by the employees who enjoy them."</p></blockquote>
It goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We understand that similar investments held on 12th September 1974 by charity trustees will be exempt from the tax and we cannot understand why trusts for the purposes of providing retirement benefits for employees should be penalised when trusts, which happen to qualify as charities, are not."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0950">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>711</span>
That is an organisation which is very experienced in running pension funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister one further question. What is the position of pension fund property unit trusts? I understand that they get their exemption from tax at present by the fact that they receive their investments from pension funds. There is the Pension Fund Property Unit Trust and there is the Property Unit Trust for Public and General Superannuation Schemes, whose report and accounts I have here. The Pension Fund Property Unit Trust was established in 1966
	<br><blockquote><p>"to enable pension funds to invest in real property on a co-operative basis".</p></blockquote>
That is a very useful provision for pension funds to invest in property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the explanation of the purpose of that trust it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the membership provisions mentioned above"—</p></blockquote>
that is that the members are pension funds—
	<br><blockquote><p>"are observed the Inland Revenue has confirmed that the Trust will be exempt from taxation on capital gains and development gains and from corporation tax. The income of the Trust suffers income tax but, in so far as this income is taxed under Schedule A or Case III of Schedule D, member funds are able to reclaim the tax deducted from distributions."</p></blockquote>
The Property Unit Trust for Public and General Superannuation Schemes is similar in that it provides investment in real property for superannuation funds, either wholly or partly approved funds. I assume that if the Bill goes through as drafted these will not be exempt from development gains tax. I am not at all sure how the tax will apply to them, but certainly it is investment in real property by members who are pension funds or superannuation funds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the major point that here we have bodies which are providing a community service to a large proportion of the public. Whether it is at large, or in general, as the Minister said, I do not think is relevant. It really is a community service, a social service, which, if these funds had a serious decrease in their assets, could not be carried on to the same capacity as at present. These bodies should not be penalised for the fact that some journalist in the investment property magazine says that some of them invest in highly dubious secondary property or investments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>712</span>
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, 99·9 per cent. of the pension funds are managed for the benefit of the pensioners, and if these funds are heavily taxed they will not be able to provide the same service as they have provided in the past. They are far more worthy to be exempt from tax than many of the authorities set out in Clause 11, and how the Minister makes the distinction that pension funds are not as worthy as these bodies set out in Clause 11, I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will not break the half-century tradition of not taxing pension funds. The argument that normally pension funds do not buy property in order to realise development value, and that therefore they need not worry much because the reputable ones will not be charged much in tax, works both ways. If there will not be much loss to the Revenue by giving exemption to pension funds, let us give it and make certain that there will not be damage to the funds and that the 12 million pensioners will not be deprived of the benefits which are at present given to them through these funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I first wish to apologise to the Committee for the fact that, because I had to go to another Committee, I have not been present throughout the whole of this debate. However, I notice that the Minister, who is, after all, a barrister, was able only to present his argument at length. I know that the English Bar is infinitely better at presenting arguments 	<i>ad longissimum</i> than is the Scottish Bar. Nevertheless, I think it is true to say that the worse the argument they have to present, the greater the tendency to prolong it. I thought that was true of the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was very short.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have spoken for only a minute. I hope that the Minister does not feel that I have spoken for too long so far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the Minister's argument did little justice, to himself or to the matter which we are discussing, or to our duty, which is primarliy to be the representative of the people in our constituencies. In this situation they are people who are in the evening of their life and who are obtaining the benefit of an investment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0951">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>713</span>
to attempt to make the evening of that life as little changed from the main part of it as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first argument which the Minister used which I found offensive was the concept—this is part of the fancy terminology of the doctrine and ideology which we have to put up with—that what the community creates should be returned to the community. That is like a nineteenth century hymn—some idyllic, false and prosaic concept—on the principle that what the Lord gives, the Lord can take away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just who is the community who creates these returns?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not seem to me to be an answer. To whom is the return made? It does not seem to me as a member, presumably, of the community, if only a fifty-six millionth part of it, that I am able to say, "Is it not marvellous that my contribution to increasing that acre in Golders Green is going to come back to me because I will be able thereby to give that little bit of it to the Scottish Development Agency to waste on its bureaucracy".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is an example of the community returning its grit and soil to the community. That is what all this slush socialist rubbish is about. Let us get down to the reality of the matter and forget that ideolical nonsense which is attempting to use words to make prosaic and dramatic the concept of taxation and salve the consciences of those hon. Gentlemen opposite that they are doing good by everything by increasing taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me consider the situation which the Minister was happy to find in some, as he put it, very respected magazine by a very respected writer that certain pension funds have to indulge in what is called a highly dubious secondary situation. Why do they do it? They do not say to themselves, "Now look chaps, what about finding a highly dubious secondary situation we can indulge in". What they do is to find themselves in a situation in which the investment of capital is outstripped by the inflation caused by the policies of the Labour Government's failure to control those to whom the Government apparently have an incestuous allegiance. Then what do they do?
	<span class='label label-info column'>714</span>
They have to protect the investment of their members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make political points. It was the inflation caused by the hon. Gentlemen's party during 1972–73, not the inflation caused by our party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly willing to take the point that those to whom the Labour Party has an incestuous allegiance forced the Conservative Government to surrender to a situation which resulted in the present inflation. I hope those lessons are being learned by all offices and all those trying to work out the policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no intention of making a party political point—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not an economic one either.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perfectly willing to treat seriously any comments from the other side, but I have no intention of treating seriously any sedentary comments from my hon. Friends.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman agree that on this occasion his hyperbole has carried him too far?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hyperbole, as the hon. Gentleman would understand if he had done classics, is not necessarily carrying anything too far. It is unnecessary to be so tautological. He may not understand that either. It is a bad word because it is a mixture of Latin with a Greek beginning. 	<i>Logos</i> is a Greek word, but logical is a Latin form from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that if one has an investment situation intended to protect the income and the value of the income of pensions, if one destroys the capacity to keep up with inflation by investment—as a result of taxation policies on industry in which that investment is made—one cannot then claim it to be a sin and a wrong to try to find an alternative security in which to keep the value of the assessment for one's beneficiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is saying that there is something sinful in trying by this means to protect income. If one is able to say "If I invest in British industry under this Government and with this rate of inflation the value to our pensioners will be halved, but if I invest in that acre of development
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0952">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>715</span>
land we may be able to keep it up to three-quarters", why is it so wrong that that ought to be taxed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Puritans have never left this country. They are to be found on the Benches opposite. They are obsessed with the idea that somebody is getting away with something. People are not getting away with something. What they are losing is the capacity to invest against inflation, and the obsession that they might make a profit because they buy a bit of land at one price and sell it at another is what it is all about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pension funds have to take steps to attempt to protect their investments. To do so in this manner does not seem to me to be wrong, but it is regarded as wrong by Members opposite and that is justified by this extraordinary concept that what the community creates should return to the community. Vague, useless terms like public ownership, which means properties owned previously by some people—members of the public—are now owned by none and are administered by anonymous bureaucracy as ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take this concept of the community and let us look at how, under Clause 11, these marvellous community agencies return what is the community's to the community. I intervened earlier about the Highlands and Islands Development Board whose chairman has made some important pronouncement, suitably from neutral ground in the Isle of Man, that the improvement and separation of Scotland is inevitable, so we ought to make it painless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether or not it is inevitable in Scotland, in that situation Scotland might divide into four other regions and separate independently, and one of them would undoubtedly be the area which happens to be covered by the Highlands and Islands Development Board. There are very few members of the community in the Highlands and Islands area covered by it who would be, or could be, or could ever put themselves in a position in which they would be, the beneficiaries of the operation under Sir Andrew Gilchrist of the Highlands and Islands Development Board. It is all right in theory. A solicitor in Fort William is a prospective beneficiary of the Highlands and Islands Development Board—and if the hon. Gentleman shakes his head he should do so in the opposite direction because that is rubbish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Everything in investment is a matter of target. No one opposite ever complains if the investment firms invest in something and lose. That is not a sin. But it is a sin to invest in something and make a gain which embarrasses people, a profit, when the purpose of doing so is to protect the value in the almost impossible conditions of inflation of retirement benefits of people who have led a useful active and industrious life—that seems quite wrong. If we let the Treasury begin it in this Bill it will enable it thereafter, as always happens in Committee—and I say this in all sincerity to hon. Members opposite—to say, "We did it in the Development Land Tax Bill and it is now, so to speak, a settled precedent." That is the danger of allowing this neat argument that if they invest in property that is their bad luck. They should be sensible people and invest in falling equities or Government stocks. If they trade in land, that is another proposition.

The one other matter of which I wish to disabuse the Minister in his so-called
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0953">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>717</span>
logic is this. He claimed that we exempt charities. A church is a church, and the land on which it sits is the land on which it sits. All we can do in a church is worship. Churches are beautiful things. The ex-Secretary of State for Social Services has said that the National Health Service was a religion, so I dare say that hospitals will be regarded as churches as well, and pay-beds will be exempted from this tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Church of England is not the Church of Scotland. It happens to have vast investments in property. Indeed, my sister-in-law's neighbour is the Church of England in Berwickshire, and very good pheasants it rears, which fly over the fence because they do not realise the territorial distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. and learned Friend is not suggesting there is only one member of the Church of England in Berwickshire. That would be an intolerable decline in church attendance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I regret to say there are no members of the Church of England in Berwickshire, with the possible exception of Professor Hugh Trevor-Roper, who makes a rather Anglican point today in 	<i>The Times.</i> But he, in any event, lives in Roxburghshire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is false to imagine, and illogical and wrong to argue, that charities only own the land they sit on. They use land and property just as much as an investment for their purposes as do pension funds, to benefit their members and it is a wrong distinction and bad in principle to treat pension funds in the different way which the Government propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that one buys an acre in Golders Green and planning permission is given. One buys it for £1,000 and sells it for £10,000, so the pension fund makes £9,000. Does that make it better or worse than the fact that one buys shares in the Keystone Garage Company and discovers that the subsoil contains tritium or one of these important nuclear fuels? Does it make any difference? Chance plays a great part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members on the Government side do not mind about bingo, premium bonds and so on. They are not taxed. They are all chance, too. But the purpose of the pension fund is to do good by people who have done good by the community, and
	<span class='label label-info column'>718</span>
I hope the Government will think hard about this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take up the last point made by my hon. and learned Friend, and in so doing say how much I support him, and apologise if I treated his earlier remarks with a levity they did not deserve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend hit upon the fatal weakness in the Minister of State's argument. The Minister knows that he is on weak ground. On the general argument as to the distortion in the market that an exemption makes, on the general argument that it is impossible to allow an exemption to a section of the community rather than to the whole community, he has an intellectually tenable argument, but when he comes to answer the question—If the churches and charities have been given a privileged position, why should not pension funds be given a privileged position?—he knows perfectly well that his case is at its weakest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us look at the two arguments the Minister advanced. The first was that the Church is part of a wider section of the community than are pension funds. All right. That might be an argument for giving an exemption to the churches alone. It certainly does not justify giving any kind of exemption or privilege to charities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second point was even weaker—it was taken up by my hon. and learned Friend—when he said that churches are built upon land and therefore some exemption must be given to the churches. But that argument does not apply to charities. It certainly does not apply to all the land that the Church of England holds as investment land. He tried to give some sort of intellectual justification to the special position that both churches and charities have been given. From the way he put his arguments, one might have thought that at the beginning of the Community Land Bill proceedings the Minister for Planning and Local Government had announced that there would be some sort of special position for churches and charities. In fact, no such thing occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the proceedings on the Community Land Bill, two factors started to draw in on the Government and on the Minister who was bashing it through the Committee. The first was a dawning, just a slight dawning glimmer of economic
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0954">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>719</span>
sanity, and I expect we have to thank the Treasury for some of the words of advice it was pouring into the ear of the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Second, there was intense pressure from interests outside the House. I suppose that those of us who were on the Community Land Bill Committee would pretend to our constituents that we played a significant part in changing the Minister's mind. No such thing happened. The Minister for Planning and Local Government pursued a line which was about 10 per cent. a smarmy attempt to ingratiate himself to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and about 90 per cent. an attempt to bash the Bill through as quickly as possible in a manner of arrogant insolence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happened in the end was that there was a very high-powered pressure campaign brought upon the Government. The churches got their members to write thousands of letters to Members of Parliament asking that they, the churches, should have a special position under the Community Land Bill and the subsequent development land tax legislation. Eventually, after the heads of the churches had been to Downing Street and had persuaded the Prime Minister that, as a matter of political expediency he, the Prime Minister, must order his Minister to give the churches a special position, that was done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: Order. I have allowed the hon. Gentleman to wander well outside the amendment. If anything, I think what he is saying would be more relevant to the next amendment, if he is dealing with charities. What happened on other Bills is not relevant to this.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reason is that I want to make plain, Mr. Crawshaw, that the way in which the Minister of State is putting this forward as though there was and always had been some clear intellectual case for allowing a special position for the churches and charities is at all well founded. What happened was that there was a gesture of political expediency. That gesture has been made. It having been made, there is no case whatsoever for making a distinction between the churches and charities and the pension funds. If the gesture of political expediency was made to the churches—and because it was made to the churches it had to be made to the charities—then, in logic,
	<span class='label label-info column'>720</span>
the same gesture ought to be made to the pension funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to gestures of political expediency. Is he, therefore, suggesting that the churches had no case in arguing this point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, they had a case. I have always felt that the Minister's case that there should be no exemptions, otherwise there would be a distortion in the market, and that it was unfair to give anybody a privileged position, was just. I made it clear in the course of the proceedings of the Community Land Bill that I thought that that was the position. In the end the Government gave way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that we shall not continue debating a Bill that has already gone through Committee. I have allowed enough latitude. This is what happens when I allow an hon. Member to go on, and I should have stopped the debate earlier. I hope that the hon. Member will continue with the amendment now before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I concude my observations. A vast concession was made to the churches and the charities. That concession has been made and it is now only just that the same concession should be to the pension funds.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened to all the speeches made by hon. Members opposite, but particularly to those made by the hon. Members for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) and for Melton (Mr. Latham) because they referred to my speech and said that it would be illogical for me to support my own amendment and not support Amendments Nos. 84 and 85 and new Clauses 1 and 3. After listening to them, I entirely agree that it would be illogical to support one without the other. I must support both or neither. This exercised my mind considerably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the speech of my hon. Friend the Minister, and I apologise for missing the first two minutes of his speeech, and I am grateful that he deferred dealing with my comments until the end of his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As is usually the case, my hon. Friend completely convinced me that it would be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0955">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>721</span>
wrong to give no doubt worthy pension funds, including local Government pension funds, an exemption from which some members of the community would not derive benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the hon. Gentleman does what I think he intends to do, and I do not want to prevent him from doing it, perhaps I should raise this as a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, if the hon. Gentleman should seek leave to withdraw his amendment, we would then proceed with Amendment No. 86 without dealing at once with the other amendments which we have been discussing. I did not want it misunderstood that we might not be pressing Amendment No. 84, if you would allow us, Mr. Crawshaw, to have a Division on that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So if I do not interrupt the hon. Gentleman any more when he asks the Committee for leave to do something, it is not because I am in agreement with him withdrawing his amendment. His case is well covered by our own amendment which appears later on the Amendment Paper, when I shall seek your permission, Mr. Crawshaw, to have a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared, when we come to it, to allow a Division on Amendment No. 84.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to be absolutely clear on this question before the hon. Gentleman withdraws his amendment. The hon. Gentleman said that because pension funds do not benefit all members of the community exemption is not justified. Is that the hon. Gentleman's criterion? If so, on what basis does he imagine that any of those bodies set out in Clause 11, or any charity or any church, benefits all the community since there are so many agnostics about?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to deal with the question of churches and charities, but I am willing to continue to talk to my own amendments, and the amendments so far as they relate to pension funds generally. A distinction could be drawn between pension funds which could benefit everyone in the community if everyone were a member of a pension fund, but I think it is true to say that everyone must
	<span class='label label-info column'>722</span>
be a member of one or other of all the other bodies mentioned in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Everyone must live within a local authority area. Therefore, in theory, everyone might benefit, but that could not be said about the restricted pension fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not pursue the matter further, because, to quote the hon. and learned Gentleman himself, a long argument—he took 17 minutes to develop his own argument—possibly connotes a weakness. My argument has taken three minutes and 20 seconds, and I hope it will be received equally well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. Is it normal for an hon. Member to withdraw his amendment and thereby stop the discussion before the Minister his replied to the principal Opposition spokesman?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The fact that an hon. Gentleman indicates that he wishes to withdraw the amendment means that if anyone else stands up afterwards to speak I must put the question to the Committee. The Amendment cannot be withdrawn after somebody has spoken afterwards. Therefore, if anybody wishes to speak I shall have to put the Question to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have indicated, however, that Amendment No. 84 will be put to a Division if it is so desired. I should have thought that that was what the Opposition wished.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not entirely sure, Mr. Crawshaw, whether I am in order. I thought that the hon. Member intended to intervene in the general discussion on this group of amendments rather than to seek to withdraw his amendment. But I wish to add a few remarks about the other amendments and I hope that it is in order for me to do so at this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As long as it is clear that I have to put Amendment No. 134 to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0956">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>723</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to repeat the arguments which have been put forward by my right hon. and hon. Friends on the merits of the wider amendments and the new clauses that we have tabled, which seek to exempt pension funds from the development land tax. However, I feel that before discussion of this topic comes to a close it would be right to consider not only some of the philosophical, legal, moral or religious aspects of it, on which we have been spending some time recently, but also to consider the practical implications of what may follow if pension funds are subject in the longer term to the development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State said in an earlier context that it was not desirable that pension funds should make windfall gains and be excluded from the development land tax by buying land on a speculative basis with the hope of making some development gain as a result. Of course it is always possible to point to individual transactions such as a famous one which has taken place recently which make the hon. Gentleman's point for him. I do not think any of us would disagree with that in principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But hard cases, or even special cases, make bad law and I think that we need to look a little more at what the longer term effects will be if pension funds have to suffer development land tax. After all, the prime objective, as the Minister of State has readily agreed, is to provide a flow of income which will support the pension benefits of the members of those pension funds for the indefinite future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with pension funds one should not devote too much importance to the fact that many of them are of relatively recent foundation. Since the Second World War pension funds as a form of investment institution have grown up and flourished in the years of prosperity up to a few years ago. Indeed, the greater consciousness of companies in providing for their employees both during their working lives and afterwards has led to a desirable spread of the institution of private pension funds by a number of companies. This, although it originally applied to the larger companies, has now spread to smaller ones.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>724</span>
In the longer term, these pension funds will have to redevelop their properties. They will not necessarily feel that they want to replace an office by an office, or a shop by a shop, or that they will have to redevelop a property purely within a 10 per cent. margin or a larger area for a fire escape. In the longer run, therefore, it would be damaging to the renewal of the sort of property investments which are held by pension funds—factories in which people work, shops in which business is done, and offices in which commerce takes place—if they were to be either discouraged from replacing their assets unless by exactly the sort of building which existed before, or if the incidence of development land tax, coupled with the redevelopment costs of pulling down an old building and building a new one at a high cost to replace it, make it difficult to re-establish a flow of income for a further generation of two for their beneficiaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would, therefore, be a great mistake if the clause were to go through without an exemption for pension funds. Although the results may not be perceptible for five or 10 years or so, in the longer run pension funds are likely to be among the few important continuing bodies which hold land and redevelop it as circumstances dictate to produce a flow of income for their beneficiaries in a way which provides new buildings for industry and commerce. I think that point ought to be on record before we leave the discussion of this topic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could intervene at this point to raise a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw.
