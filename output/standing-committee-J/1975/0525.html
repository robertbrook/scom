	<p>	<i>Question proposed—(20th May</i>)—That this schedule, as amended, be the Eighth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with a number of points raised by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) at the end of our last sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point that the right hon. Gentleman raised concerned notices of part disposals. He suggested that the exclusion of part disposals, under paragraph (	<i>c</i>), from the scope of sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 37 of the schedule would lead to the Board receiving large numbers of notifications of trivial part disposals. Perhaps I may point out to the right hon. Gentleman that in fact paragraph 37 applies only where the person making the disposal is chargeable to DLT as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 37 in general deals with situations which are not covered by paragraphs 35 and 36. Paragraph 37 is intended to ensure that the Inland Revenue is notified of all other disposals of interests in land which may give rise to liability to DLT. This is done by requiring a person who is chargeable to DLT as a result of a disposal of an interest in land to submit a notice if the circumstances are not covered by pargraphs 35 and 36.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under sub-paragraph (2), a notice is not required if the disposal relates to a dwelling house which with any connected land comprises one acre or less—the disposal is not a part disposal and the consideration does not exceed £25,000. The purpose of this provision is to give a blanket assurance to vendors of most private houses, and their advisers, that they need not consider the possibility of a DLT notification being required, and thus to guard against
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1538</span>
notices being given out of excessive caution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore do not think that in fact excluding part disposals will mean that the Board will receive a large number of notifications of trivial part disposals, as paragraph 37 applies only where the person making the disposal is chargeable to DLT as a result.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that that leaves it to the judgment of the chargeable person to decide whether he may be liable. As an abundance of caution I should have thought that everybody would therefore serve a notice just in case he is told later that he might be responsible for the tax. I still think that there should be some 	<i>de minimis</i> provision here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some people are more cautious than others. It might be quite clear to some on the surface that there will not be a liability, but I agree that if there is doubt cautious and sensible people will in fact inform the Revenue. We shall keep this matter under review and, if it appears to be causing a weight of bureaucracy or difficulty, we shall look at it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next, the right hon. Gentleman complained that paragraph 40(2)(	<i>b</i>) of Schedule 8 provided for a penalty of up to £5,000 for failure to give certain notices. As the Board did not have to give any warning to the taxpayer before a penalty was incurred, he felt that this was unfair to a person who unwittingly failed to comply with his obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, in most cases sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 40 ensures that a person will not be liable to a penalty for failure to give a statutory notice if the failure is remedied before proceedings for the recovery of the penalty are commenced. This protection is not afforded in the case of a penalty under paragraph 40(2)(	<i>b</i>), because that penalty relates to a particularly serious situation. This is where a person fails for more than six months to give notice of the start of a project of material development or of additional development. If a project of material development is far advanced by the time it comes to the Revenue's notice, there may be difficult and acute valuation problems. Even in those cases the taxpayer would have the right of appeal against the amount of the panelty under Section 100(6) of the Taxes Management Act 1970,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1394">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1539</span>
and the Board would have discretion under Section 102 of that Act to mitigate a penalty, stay or compound any proceedings for recovery thereof and, after judgment, further mitigate or entirely remit the penalty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not, therefore, concerned with the normal situation under sub paragraph (4) of failure to give notice. We are concerned with more serious cases under sub paragraph (2)(	<i>b</i>) where the person has failed for more than six months to give notice of a project of material development. That is why the penalty is greater but, as I indicated, there are provisions for appeal under the Taxes Management Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then dealt with the question of the assessment of an agent on behalf of a non-resident. He suggested that it was unfair that, under the new Section 85A of the Taxes Management Act 1970, which is introduced by paragraph 20 of Schedule 8, a non-resident person could be assessed to development land tax in the name of a branch or agent, whether or not the branch or agent has the receipt of any consideration for the disposal giving rise to the liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision is similar to those in Sections 78 and 85 of the Taxes Management Act which apply for income tax and corporation tax respectively. They are well established for the purposes of those taxes. It is right that the duly appointed agent of a non-resident person should be assessable and chargeable to development land tax, whether or not he receives the proceeds of the disposal, as otherwise it would be a simple matter to avoid the tax by appointing an agent to arrange the disposal and having the proceeds paid directly to the non-resident or to some other person on his behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not a new provision. It is extremely old in relation to taxing Acts where, for people concerned with corporation tax, and so on, the agent is assessed. There have been discussions as to what agents are, who, and who are not, agents, and what does a person need to do to be an agent. Basically, however, this goes back a long way in fiscal legislation and is a protection to the Revenue in the case of a non-resident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agent has his remedy in contract against his non-resident principal. That is a matter for him. If he is acting as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1540</span>
agent for a non-resident principal, he must ensure that he has full protection, not only against assessment under this Bill but against assessment to other taxes, and a prudent agent would no doubt do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a rather different position when an agent is collecting, for example, rents and income. He will know far more about his principal than, say, an estate agent who is instructed to sell property and receives a deposit. How is he to know whether his principal is resident or non-resident? Is every estate agent, whenever he receives instructions, now to inquire of his principal "Are you resident in the United Kingdom, or not?".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that in many cases, even in the collection of rents, the agent would know. There is a provision for deducting tax from rents paid abroad in certain cases. Again, the agent would know if land was being sold or not. I do not want to give a legal opinion now, but if the land was sold completely outside the contract of agency, as between the non-resident and the agent, and if the agent could show "It is nothing to do with my agency. I am just collecting rents," surely that would be a different case. If he could show he was not an agent for that purpose, and that his job was just to collect rents, I doubt whether there would beliability, but that might depend on the particular case. But if he is strictly an agent for these purposes it is right that he should be made liable, and his remedy is against his principal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point dealt with the set-off of development land tax against other taxes. The right hon. Gentleman said that it did not make administrative sense that paragraph 24 of Schedule 8 prevented overpaid development land tax being set against other Inland Revenue taxes, so requiring the Board to repay the tax and then to collect an equivalent amount separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman may not have entirely understood the purpose of the paragraph. Section 91(2) of the Taxes Management Act entitles a taxpayer to require that an amount of tax repayable to him shall be treated as if it were a discharge of the tax charged upon him by another assessment. By so doing, he is able to reduce the amount of interest that might otherwise be chargeable on tax unpaid under the other assessment. This is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1395">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1541</span>
reasonable where tax repayments do not themselves carry interest but would be inappropriate when the tax repayment itself carries interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exclusion of DLT from the scope of Section 91(2) of the Taxes Management Act will not, however, prevent a repayment of development land tax and the associated interest being set against and regarded as payment of other outstanding tax as a matter of practical convenience. It will be possible for this to be arranged at the taxpayer's request. If the taxpayer requests it, it will be possible to set-off the one liability against the other—(	<i>Interruption.</i>) What I was saying was that under the Taxes Management Act this is not a situation that that section is designed to meet. It is designed to meet a different kind of situation, but there is nothing to stop this from being done. A taxpayer may want to do it, and there is nothing to stop him from coming to an agreement or arrangement with the inspector of taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point dealt with the time limit for giving notice of the start of a project of material development. The right hon. Gentlemen complained that 30 days after the start of a project of material development was an unreasonably short period in which the holder of a major interest in land had to give notice of the project to the Board. The right hon. Gentleman pointed out that failure to give notice within the prescribed time could make the person concerned liable to penalties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A project of material development is not something which is started without a good deal of forward planning and in the ordinary way 30 days should provide ample time for a notice to be given. Indeed, it is expected that in many cases the person concerned will prefer to give notice during the 60 days before the date when the project is intended to be started, as he is permitted to do by paragraph 36 (1) (	<i>a</i>). These notices will be the main source of information to the DLT office that a project has started, and it is reasonable to require that they should be given within a comparatively short period of time so that valuations can be made before the development has proceeded so far as to hinder the determination of those values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that notice should be given, and the right hon. Gentleman mentioned the cautious taxpayer who will want to give notice. I should have thought
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1542</span>
that in most cases taxpayers would want to give a notice because of the difficulties of valuation which could arise if these matters were left for a long time. Values change, and the project might change in value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the giving of a late notice will not automatically invoke the penalty procedures in the Bill. Section 118 (2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970, which is intended to apply to DLT, provides that a person shall be deemed not to have failed to do anything required to be done within a limited time if he did it within such further time, if any, as the Board or the Commissioners or the officer concerned may have allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 118 (2) provides a let-out through what may appear to be a rule of absolute liability. In addition, if a person had a reasonable excuse for not giving notice he would be deemed not to have failed to do so if he remedied the omission without reasonable delay after the excuse had ceased. If he can show that he had a reasonable ground for not giving notice, he is not treated as having failed to give notice within the desired time. This incorporates a provision of the Taxes Management Act which is common to other taxes and is not confined to this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was one of the points that I raised. I am grateful that the Minister touched on this. Is it not true that the Bill has within it rather basic differences from other taxes on the question of assessment and liability for tax? For instance, there is the problem whether a project falls within the 10 per cent. cubic content allowance. There might well be, at the margin, a problem here of genuine doubts on the taxpayer's part. Is there not a good case for building a greater flexibility into this Bill than into other tax legislation, on the question of notice? I did not quite understand the Minister's explanation. Can a person who does not give the notice argue subsequently that he had good reason for not giving notice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This may be different from other taxes, but it is not all that different. Other taxes also occasionally involve difficult questions as to whether there is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1396">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1543</span>
liability. It may be said that it is better to get it done quickly than to leave it for a longer time, as difficulties and uncertainties may increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The next point the right hon. Gentleman mentioned was in relation to the remission of interest at the Board's discretion. I think he mentioned the figure of £10. He suggested that subsection (5) of the new Section 86A of the Taxes Management Act, which will be introduced by Schedule 8(21) to the Bill, should provide for interest charges which do not exceed £10 to be remitted automatically, instead of if the Board thinks fit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The discretionary provision which we are incorporating into the Taxes Management Act is in line with Section 86(6) of that Act, but it must be accepted that the situation is not entire y the same here as for income tax. If a taxpayer has income from sources assessable under different cases of Schedule D, it is usual for economy and convenience to put all the assessments on to one assessment notice. If the £10 limit were to be applied to each income tax assessment separately, it would require a good deal of pointless work to disaggregate the various amounts charged in a single notice. If the £10 limit were made personal to the taxpayer himself, it would require an almost equally unprofitable job of aggregating the interest payable on all the assessments made on the taxpayer, which might have been made at different times in different offices. DLT assessments will not include any other tax liability. It is therefore not essential that the DLT provision should follow the income tax precedent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the general principle is that interest should accrue when payment of tax is delayed beyond its reckonable date. The £10 	<i>de minimis</i> limit does not affect the principle of the taxpayer's liability. It is simply an administrative arrangement to save work on trivial cases. Despite what I have said, on balance the Revenue thinks it a proper case for administrative discretion, although I accept that there is a difference here between the income tax and development land tax. On balance, we do not think that it will create hardship and would prefer to keep the discretion rather than have an absolute £10 	<i>de minimis</i> limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point that the right hon. Gentleman raised was with regard to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1544</span>
differing notices of the commencement of a project under Schedule 8, paragraph 36. He argued that it was unfair that, when more than one person had the obligation to give a notice under that paragraph, the person who first gave such a notice should be able to determine the nature and extent of the project and, in consequence, the liabilities of other persons with a major interest in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of a first notice of the start of a project is not as final as the right hon. Gentleman suggests, because it is open to any of those other persons to give notice of the variation of the project, or notice of additional development, under paragraph 36(4) and (5). But the position may not be wholly satisfactory, and I give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that we shall look at the matter again before Report, with a view to ensuring that the liabilities of those concerned properly reflect the facts of each case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have properly dealt with the right hon. Member's points, but if there is anything else I shall endeavour to deal with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with those points. I appreciate that they were not on the Amendment Paper and, therefore, had to be specially looked up when I raised them in the "Schedule stand part" debate. I am grateful to the Minister for that one out of 10 which he gave me at the final point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I must have got out of bed on the wrong side this morning. I felt very aggressive while the Minister was speaking. I did not agree with nine-tenths of what he was saying. The Minister seemed to have been briefed to push aside and consider as trivial the several important points which were raised by saying that they were answered somewhere in the Bill or in the Taxes Management Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not satisfied with the Minister's answers to those points. My arguments on these matters are on the record of our last sitting, and I do not want to labour them further. However, I wich carefully to consider what the Minister has said and decide whether it will be necessary for us to table further amendments later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am particularly concerned with the penalties clause. We are dealing here with a new tax and the penalties such as are imposed under Clause 37(2)(	<i>b</i>) are swingeing penalties. It is all very well to say that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1397">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1545</span>
the chargeable person, or the person liable to give a notice, or whatever it may be, has a right of appeal. Of course he has a right of appeal. But that throws all the burden on to him rather than the legislation protecting him in a reasonable way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to labour the point. I wish to consider the Minister's reply so that I can decide whether anything should be done later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave this debate on the schedule, would the Minister deal with the second point which I raised at an earlier sitting? It concerns the whole question of when interest becomes due on unpaid tax. The Minister is nodding his head which means that he has probably picked up the point. Why should there be this inconsistency between the due date, as defined in the Bill as drafted, and the date from which the interest becomes payable? A due date from which the tax becomes payable should be the date from which interest is payable. This distinction is a genuine mystery to me. I should be grateful for some reaction from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no great mystery. We start from the premise that the reason why interest runs from an early point—namely, the reckonable date —is to ensure that people settle their liabilities as quickly as possible. That is why the interest runs from the reckonable date. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman considers that to be unfair, but in the Bill the interest runs from that point. This does not mean that there is no need for a due date. A due date is that on which the tax is collectible by the Inland Revenue. For various reasons the individual may not wish to pay the tax immediately, and so the interest starts to run. But there must be some date from which the Revenue says tax becomes payable and if it is not paid by the due date it will send bailiffs in and mark furniture, or whatever happens in these cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I suggest to the hon. Gentleman that there must be some due date from which the tax is payable, although we have provided—I accept that he thinks that this is unfair—that interest shall run from a particular time in order to ensure that the taxpayer and the Revenue get together as quickly as possible to agree the computation and the tax and settle the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1546</span>
liabilities. There has to be a due date. The hon. Gentleman may argue and say that interest should run only from some time closer to the due date, but, if he accepts our argument that, to some extent, the interest is an encouragement to taxpayers to settle their liabilities, there should be some difference between the time when the interest is payable and the date of actual collection on which the Revenue is legally entitled to go in and get its money. Up to that time the taxpayer can pay the interest and keep the money. In some cases, he may want to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is extremely knowledgeable on this matter, so perhaps he can explain the meaning of the word "due", where "due" is when the tax is owed. If that is the point from which the tax is owed, under any normal borrowing arrangement presumably that is the point from which interest on the money owed should become payable. It seems straightforward, but the Minister may have a different meaning of the word "due" which I have not grasped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. Gentleman does not accept that interest should run from an earlier period. The meaning of "due" does not matter. The tax is due on the due date, and that is when the tax has to be paid. The legislation provides that interest should run from an earlier period so that these matters are decided quickly, liabilities are decided quickly, and the taxpayer is encouraged to pay the tax as quickly as possible. But if he does not wish to pay the tax and pay the interest on the due date, he has that option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This clause follows naturally from the previous provisions of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1547</span>
the Bill concerning the distinction between the trustee and beneficiary. Under Clause 42, the trustees of settled land can use their powers of raising capital in order to pay the tax. That must follow, since it is a capital tax. As I understand the clause, there is a distinction that they would not be entitled to raise capital to pay interest on the tax. I assume, however, that they would be entitled to raise capital out of property which may be specifically allocated to some other beneficiaries. I imagine that the clause stretches over the whole settlement, and that it is in the discretion of the trustees, however the trust may be split under the settlement, to raise capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a number are entitled under the settlement, and the payment of tax arising from the disposal of one property is really the eventual liability of one beneficiary. The clause would give the trustees the power to raise the tax out of other property in the settlement. That is probably logically right from the point of view of treating the trustees as one chargeable person and disregarding the beneficiaries of the eventual payment of the proceeds on the settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have understood the position correctly. It seems rather fierce on the beneficiaries, but once the settlement is treated as a unit, I think it is the only way to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, the right hon. Gentleman, as so often, correctly understood the clause. It is to cover cases under the Settled Land Act 1925, property held on trust for sale, and some other cases, such as land held by the universities and colleges of Oxford, Cambridge and Durham, and the colleges of Eton and Winchester. In relation to Scotland, it covers land held by a trustee, a proper liferenter, or an heir of entail in possession, and in Northern Ireland, it covers settled land under the Settled Land Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the main, it is the Settled Land Act, 1925 and land held on trust for sale. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, for land held under the Settled Land Act the legal estate normally is for a tenant for life, or the tenant for life cannot sell it without the consent of the trustees, I seem to remember from my examination days; or perhaps it is the other way round. The Trustees would have to have power to use the capital moneys to pay the tax, because in the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1548</span>
case of the Settled Land Act the trustees do not have an absolute power to pay out capital moneys unless that power is defined under the Settled Land Act 1925.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to trusts for sale, the right hon. Gentleman will know the famous doctrine of conversion where, if land is held on trust for sale it is deemed to have been converted into money. It is necessary to have this procedure because the Act imposes a liability on the sale of land to ensure that the trustees can pay the tax out of the capital of the trust without falling foul of any of these ancient doctrines of the Court of Equity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does Clause 42 apply to a trust for sale? If it is a purely straightforward trust for sale and not a settlement, I would have thought this would not apply: it would not need to apply. Surely the trustees holding under a trust for sale would have power otherwise to raise capital? It would only delay the decision. I should think the clause unnecessary in the case of a trust for sale but necessary in the case of a strict settlement. If the Minister will turn to the left he will probably find the answer waiting for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is probably right. I probably went too far when I said "trust for sale in general." I should have said trusts for sale in Clause 42(1)(	<i>a</i>), as applied by Section 28 of the Law of Property Act, not trusts for sale in general. I am not quite sure what specific trusts for sale are dealt with under Section 28, but the general point the right hon. Gentleman makes must be correct. In an ordinary trust for sale there would probably be no need for this power.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

your judgment, Mr. Crawshaw, but I do not know why my Amendment No. 416 has not been called. We have not dealt with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may deal with the point which I had intended to raise there on "clause stand part", it is that Clause 43(1) gives a statutory definition to the duration of a lease when it states:
	<br><q><p>"Where the terms of a lease include provision for the extension of the lease beyond a given date…it shall be assumed for the purposes of this Act…that the term of the lease will extend for"—</p></q>
and these are the words which I question—
	<br><q><p>"as long as it can be extended by the tenant."</p></q>
The best example of this would be business premises. The lease will state the length of term on which the premises are let. But when that term comes to an end the tenant has power to extend and to apply to the court to grant him an extension. Is that included in the words
	<br><q><p>"as long as it can be extended by the tenant."?</p></q>
If the tenant has a statutory right to extend, is that included in subsection (1), or must be he able to point to a provision within the lease itself for an extension? That is, by giving notice to the landlord he is entitled to claim an extension of the lease. It may be that the landlord and not the tenant has a right to extend. That would be unusual, perhaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also cases of revision of rent where, if the parties come to an agreement over a new rent review, the lease continues. It depends on the wording of the lease as to how this would operate. Would it be right to say that the tenant has a right of extension of the lease when it depends on the wording of the lease as to how this would operate. Would it be right to say that the tenant has a right of extension of the lease when it depends whether he and the landlord can agree upon a review of the rent? I may be wrong, and it may be quite clear when one interprets the words correctly, but I am left in some doubt as to what Clause 43(1) means in relation to those cases where the tenant has certain conditional rights on which to extend the lease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has raised doubts in my mind as well. I agree with him that it is not clear whether a statutory right to extend a lease could be said to be the tenant's right to extend the lease, if I may put it that way.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1550</span>
I will look at this and write to the right hon. Gentleman telling him what we have in mind. If it is necessary to make it clearer, we shall of course do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one other point. I am sorry to deal with these points one by one. Subsection (5) is neatly explained by the Explanatory Notes as follows:
	<br><q><p>"A lease is treated as having been materially varied if, on a disposal, its duration is altered, of if restrictions on the tenant's right to develop are released or modified."</p></q>
The question is how we are to judge whether it is "materially" varied. This looks like an invitation to litigation as to whether the terms and conditions of a lease, when varied, are "materially varied". I suppose that one falls back on the "project of material development", where the word "material" is also used. There may be precedents for what is a material variation in other parts of the law, or I may have missed something in the interpretation clause which tells us what "material" means—it is only just over the page, and I ought perhaps to have kept a little further ahead in making certain. The interpretation clause certainly tells us about "material development", but not about a material variation, I think that this will cause some difficulty when one comes to interpret it. I see that it is also referred to in subsection (4) of Clause 43.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Subsection (5) restricts the words "material variation" to some extent, as it provides that
	<br><q><p>"For the purposes of subsection (4) above, there is a material variation of the terms and conditions of a lease where—",</p></q>
followed by the provisions of paragraph (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). I should have thought that paragraph (	<i>a</i>) was fairly strict:
	<br><q><p>"there is a variation of any terms and conditions which, on a disposal, would be relevant to determine the duration of the lease for the purposes of this Act…or"</p></q>
and paragraph (	<i>b</i>) then reads:
	<br><q><p>"the terms and conditions are varied by the release or modification of a covenant or agreement restricting the material development"</p></q>
—which is of course, defined—
	<br><q><p>"of any of the land in which the lease subsists."</p></q>
The words are, therefore, not quite so wide as the right hon. Gentleman indicated. But again, I will look at that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

ously thought that that amendment was drafting amendment. Having heard the debate, I was obviously wrong and the right hon. Gentleman was right.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call Amendment No. 269, I draw the Committee's attention to Clause 46. On the selection list a Government amendment has been omitted. I erroneously thought that it was to be moved formally, but it has not in fact been discussed. Amendment No. 466 will therefore be the first amendment to be called when we reach Clause 46.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 269, in page 65, line 27, after 'contract', insert:
	<br><q><p>'(including one which is conditional on the exercise of an option)'.</p></q>
This amendment is really an inquiry. I may be told that it is unnecessary as a result of other provisions elsewhere in the Bill or I may be told that it is not intended. I want to find out whether, when subsection (6) refers to "a conditional contract", this also involves the exercise of an option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Explanatory Notes subsection (6) is explained:
	<br><q><p>"If the consideration for the disposal under a conditional contract entered into before 13th September 1974 does not depend wholly or mainly on the value of the interest when the condition is satisfied, the contract is regarded as never having been conditional and thus the disposal is treated as occurring before the Appointed Day."</p></q>
Does that also include the exercise of an option?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 44(6) provides that on the disposal of an interest in land under a conditional contract entered into before 13th September 1974, the contract is treated as if it were uncon-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1552</span>
ditional for the purposes of subsection (2), where the consideration does not depend wholly or mainly on the value of the interest at the time the condition is satisfied. The effect is that the disposal is treated as having occurred before the appointed day and any development value realised is not liable to DLT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment, as the right hon. Gentleman has explained, seeks to make it clear that for the purposes of the subsection a conditional contract includes a contract conditional on the exercise of an option. The amendment is unnecessary, and I am advised that it might make the situation less clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The wording of Clauses 44(2) makes it clear that for the purposes of the clause as a whole the expression "conditional contract" includes a contract conditional on the exercise of an option. This case is quoted as a particular example of a conditional contract. Having done this once in subsection (2), there is no need to do so all over again in subsection (6). Indeed, to do so might cast uncertainty on the meaning of "conditional contract" as used elsewhere in the Bill. I merely throw that in as a last shot.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those reasons the amendment is not necessary because Clause 44(2) makes it clear that a contract conditional on an option is one example of a conditional contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two points on Clause 44 on which I should like to ask the Minister some questions and on which I have some criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a little confusing when one reads the whole of Clause 44 and discovers that the date of disposal is not the date of acquisition. It sounds rather like Concorde arriving in Washington an hour before it took off from here. I do not know whether the explanation of Clause 44 is that we cross the date line from subsection (1) to subsection (9).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1401">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was drafted in an aeroplane.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it was drafted in an aeroplane, as my hon. Friend says. But in explanation of subsection (9) we are told that
	<br><q><p>"Subsections (6) to (8) serve only to establish times of disposal, not of acquisition."</p></q>
I assume from that that when we are dealing with subsections (6) to (8), we are thinking of the time that the event occurs on which the tax is chargeable, but otherwise when we are dealing with acquisition we are concerned mainly with the base to be taken on some future disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have interpreted this correctly, otherwise I cannot see why there should ever be a disposal without an acquisition or an acquisition without a disposal. Why should they be at different times, except that I can see in subsection (4) distinct case of disposal and acquisition taking place at the time when neither occurred. Subsection (4) deals with compulsory purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again I resort to the very helpful Explanatory Notes which reduce the seven lines of subsection (4) to two very convenient and concise lines:
	<br><q><p>"The time of disposal and acquisition by compulsory purchase is when the compensation is agreed or, if earlier, the date of entry."</p></q>
That seems to be so grossly unfair on the individual involved, as against the authority, that it should not be allowed to remain as it is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of compensation may be agreed a long time before it is paid, or a long time before the acquisition takes place, and before the property is disposed of to the local authority or public body concerned. If the date of entry is to be taken, there is no obligation upon the authority to pay any compensation, let alone the 90 per cent., when it enters the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to see the subsection taken out of the clause altogether and let the date when completion of the compulsory acquisition takes place be the date when the money is paid, and the money is, therefore, in the hands of the person who is chargeable to tax. If my calculations on the reckonable date are right, he is to commence paying interest three months
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1554</span>
after the compensation is agreed. He is placed in an intolerable position if he has not received the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an even more peculiar position arising from subsection (5). The Explanatory Notes state:
	<br><q><p>"The time of disposal and acquisition under a vesting declaration or order is the time at which it becomes operative."</p></q>
I am on record over the past 20 years as objecting strongly to vesting declarations and vesting orders. I am glad to say that as a general rule local authorities and other public bodies do not resort to this mandatory procedure of getting vesting orders and declarations without properly having the title conveyed to them. However, it is possible that a vesting order may be made without any purchase money or compensation being paid. This could again be a case where the disposal and acquisition, and all that arises from it, may be deemed statutorily to occur when the taxpayer, or the chargeable person, has no money and may not receive any for some considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position is further complicated by subsection (8), for which the Explanatory Notes state:
	<br><q><p>"A disposal by compulsory purchase is treated as having been made before the Appointed Day if notice to treat was (or was deemed to have been) served before 13 September 1974."</p></q>
We have, therefore, yet another date. The notice to treat is to be treated as the disposal, not the acquisition by the acquiring authority, but as the date of disposal by the chargeable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To some extent I can understand that as a logical argument. All through the Bill the date of contract is the date of disposal. Again, I do not agree with that because it is not the date on which the money is paid. We have always said that this tax should be applicable only when the money is in the hands of the chargeable person. Nevertheless, that is logical. A notice to treat in law is a contract. We know that from other legislation. It is to be treated as the date of a contract between the acquiring authority and the person from whom the property is acquired. So, to some extent, I understand that. But we are presented with several dates. I suppose one starts with the date on which the notice to treat is served. Then we are told that a date some time after that must be taken—the date when compensation is agreed, or, if earlier, the date of entry. Then another two
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1402">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1555</span>
dates are thrown in—the dates on which the vesting declaration or the vesting order become operative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44, therefore, is very confusing in this respect. It is even more confusing—but perhaps this is my own confusion, rather than the confusion of the Bill—when we are told that if something happens before 13th September 1974, it will be deemed to have happened before or after 1st August 1976, if that happens to be the appointed day. For example, subsection (7) says that where a firm arrangement was made before 13th September 1974 to dispose of an interest in land and the disposal takes place within a year of the appointed day, then the resulting contract will be treated in the manner specified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, why does subsection (7) say within a year of the appointed day? If there is a firm arrangement, surely the logic of this clause is that that is the contract. If that is so, why limit the period for completion of the contract to a year after the appointed day? Surely, it ought to apply whenever it takes place. But there my question arises probably because I do not understand the introduction of the appointed day into all these subsections when we are talking about something which happens before 13th September 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the main aspects of Clause 44 about which I complain. The more I study it, the more puzzled I am by the whole clause and the more difficult it is. It is a sort of octopus, whose tentacles go into all parts of the Bill. When considering the time of disposal and the time of acquisition elsewhere in the Bill, one will have to read Clause 44 again and again to find out which time is to be applied.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to assist the right hon. Gentleman, although he is not alone in finding the clause difficult. However, it has to deal with difficult situations. Again, we are in a transitional position. It is for that reason that the normal rule that disposal and acquisition take place at the time when the contract is made is displaced, especially by subsections (4), (5) and (8), and also by subsections (6) and (7) in relation to conditional contracts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions to which the right hon. Gentleman has drawn attention are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1556</span>
designed to protect the vendor and ensure that he does not pay development land tax in these cases. It is to protect vendors who had already committed themselves by entering into conditional contracts or who had, without having actually exchanged contracts, made firm arrangements for sale before the first announcement on 12th September 1974 of the intention to impose development land tax. That is why we have those special rules. Otherwise something could happen—the completion of a contract or exchange of contracts—after that date, and tax would be payable as on a disposal. They are intended, therefore, to protect the vendor from paying tax, and they have the effect of excluding from the charge a person who had agreed before 13th September 1974 to sell for a stated price, and does so within a year of the appointed day. There is also provision to relieve from the charge a disposal under a conditional contract entered into before 13th September 1974, if the consideration for the disposal does not depend wholly or mainly on the value of the land at the time the condition is satisfied. If that provision was not there, and the condition was satisfied later, the disposal would be deemed to have taken place after 13th September 1974, and tax would be payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an exclusion from the charge for a disposal to an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers if notice to treat was served before 13th September 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the clauses in slightly more detail, because they are complicated. I shall deal with subsection (6) in itself, which provides that on the disposal of an interest in land under a conditional contract entered into before 13th September 1974, the contract is treated as if it was unconditional for the purposes of subsection (2)—which incorporates the main rule—where the consideration does not depend wholly or mainly on the value of the interest at the time the condition is satisfied. The effect of this is that the disposal is treated as having occurred before the appointed day, and any development value realised is not liable to DLT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus that kind of conditional contract, where the consideration does not depend wholly or mainly on the value of the interest, is treated as an unconditional contract made before 13th September 1974, so that there is no liability to DLT when-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1403">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1557</span>
ever the condition is satisfied or whenever the disposal takes place. "Wholly or mainly" is not defined, but it is a term normally used in fiscal legislation. No doubt, there may be some disputes in practice, but we think it best not to define it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) deals with the case where an owner has arranged to dispose of an interest in land before 13th September 1974, and does, in fact, dispose of it under a contract made within 12 months of the appointed day on terms not materially different from those of the arrangement. If the contract is unconditional, it is treated as if it was made before the appointed day. If the contract is conditional, it is treated as if it was made before 13th September 1974. The arrangement must have been made in writing or be evidenced by a memorandum or note made before 13th September 1974. The effect is that there will be no liability to DLT is the contract is unconditional. If it is conditional, there will be no liability if the terms of subsection (6) are met—that is, provided the disposal for is
	<br><q><p>"a consideration not depending wholly or mainly on the value of the interest at the time the condition is satisfied…"</p></q>
Subsection (8), to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, provides that a disposal to an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers on or after the appointed day is to be treated as having been made before that day if notice to treat was, or was deemed to have been, served before 13th September 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus these are relieving provisions to ensure that what was done before 13th September 1974 shall be conclusive in the sense that that date is treated as the acquisition time for these purposes, despite the fact that generally that would not be counted as an acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked "Why a year?" in relation to an arrangement which was not a contract but was evidenced by some kind of memorandum. I am told that the 12 months' limit follows a similar provision in the Finance Act 1974 about development gains. It has been adapted for DLT purposes. Perhaps I may give my own reason. We are concerned here with, not necessarily a contract, but an arrangement which may be evidenced. I should have thought it made sense to have some limitation on the period of time. If he has not disposed within the year, as time
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1558</span>
proceeds it may become more difficult to find out what exactly happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a concession, in the sense that the man who has no contract can still get the benefit, but I suggest that it is reasonable and fair to put some time limit on it; otherwise the situation could go on for years. People may forget what the arrangements were intended to mean, and there could be—and has been—a great deal of litigation on such arrangements as they are not formally incorporated into a contract. I suggest to him that that is why there is a time limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned compensation. For the record, I merely reiterate that if compensation is agreed, interest will run with compensation and also the vendor can demand an advance payment of 90 per cent. of the agreed compensation, or of the authorities' estimate of the compensation, if it is not finally agreed. That is provided for under Section 52 (3) of the Land Compensation Act 1973. It does not make much sense to me, but perhaps it will make sense to the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that last point, if the chargeable person makes a demand for his 90 per cent., he will get the tax deducted from it, if it is paid. New Schedule 7 provides for that, so he will not do very well out of it. However, it may well be that he does not wish to do that and to receive 90 per cent. at that time. He may be happy without it and prefer to leave it to completion. There might be some logic in it if it were said that if he demands that 90 per cent. he would be treated as having completed his sale by compulsory purchase or forming some contract which would come within the provisions of the first part of Clause 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give the Minister notice that I shall seek to have this subsection taken out of the Bill at a future date. It is only through these explanations and those given in previous debates that I have realised that it is so damaging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is an Alice-in-Wonderland situation in saying that this is the date of disposal and acquisition when it is merely an agreement on the amount of compulsory purchase money. However, I have made my point and I shall study again the Minister's remarks.

On the question of the firm arrangement under subsection (7), am I right in thinking that this means that if a person can show in writing that there is a gentleman's agreement between two people, there is no need for an enforceable contract or, as I learned in my youth, the three "p's" of the written memorandum to get specific performance? It can be a purely gentlemen's agreement, unenforceable at law, provided that it can be shown that it is an arrangement between the two. It is a perculiar subsection in which to find this provision in the statute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no major questions on this clause, but it is so important that perhaps the Minister should help us on defining an "interest in land".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the exclusion of mortgagee's interest—namely, that if every property is transferred or conveyed by way of security, that does not create an interest in land. Of course, it may do so eventually if the mortgagee forecloses or takes similar action, but at the stage of the conveyance by way of security—namely, the mortgage, or charge, it is not an interest in land. However, I presume that otherwise from subsection (1) all that one normally understands is that "interests in land" are included, although the draftsman of the Bill has chosen to give an express definition for the purpose of the Bill instead of referring back to the Law of Property Act, in which the definitions are clear. I presume that it includes easements—we have talked about that previously—and such matters as rent charges, chief rents, ground rents, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not fond of legislation by reference, but would not it have been better to use a familiar description of "interest in land" as it appears in the property statutes even if we repeated it in the Bill verbatim? As it stands, as an entirely new definition, one puzzles over it to find out exactly what it means, what it includes and what it excludes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has not done justice to the draftsman. It is not an entirely new definition. The draftsman says that interest in land means
	<br><q><p>"any estate or interest in land".</p></q>
which I would have thought is a very old definition. It goes back a long way and no doubt the right hon. Gentleman could wade through the cases. But the right hon. Gentleman has included other things which, on their face value, might not seem to be "interest in land". He has set them out quite properly, but the main definition is the definition of interest in land which means

The amendment redrafts the definition of "personal representatives" in Clause 46(1) so as to include a specific reference to Scotland. The substance of the definition is not affected but during the Standing Committee debate on Clause 5 the method of adapting the expression "personal representatives" to the Scottish legal system was criticised. The definition was taken from Section 432(4) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 which in turn goes back to 1938. Nevertheless, we agreed to alter the definition to take into account the Scottish position. The amendment seeks to do this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "judicial factor" is used elsewhere in the Bill, namely in Clause 32(8). A judicial factor is a person appointed by the Court of Session to manage and administer estates where, for example, the owner was under a mental or physical incapacity. There are various other circumstances in which a judicial factor would be appointed.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 271, in page 68, line 42, leave out 'three' and insert 'twelve'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The definition as it stands is that the 'reckonable date'
	<br><q><p>"in relation to the liability of any person for an amount of development land tax, means the date on which expires the period of three months beginning with the date of the disposal or other event which gives rise to that liability".</p></q>
This carries out the principle which we have asked on many occasions should be adopted, that the chargeable person should be given time to order his affairs and pay the tax out of the proceeds of the disposal. Also, he should not be charged interest on any tax due after as short a period as three months. For that reason the amendment would insert "twelve months" into the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not looked up the precedents in other tax legislation for the 12-month period, but I do not recollect anything quite as short as three months on which interest starts to run. As we have said again and again, this is a new type of levy on the unfortunate vendor of land. We ought to recognise that he should have a period of time in which to make the payment. I hope that the Minister will accept a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1564</span>
longer period than three months in the definition of the reckonable date and will accept our amendment to twelve months.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not perhaps debated an amendment quite on these lines previously, but we have been over this ground before. There have been criticisms of the reckonable date to the effect that interest should not run from the reckonable date. Here we have an amendment which says that the reckonable date should be more than three months—that it should be 12 months—from the date of contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen will not be surprised if I say that I cannot accept the amendment. We have chosen three months because we think it is a reasonable period. Normally, a conveyance takes place within six weeks of contract. There may be some cases where this does not happen, but the Law Society rules provide for conveyance to take place within six weeks of contract. After six weeks the taxpayer has the money with which to pay the tax. He may not have computed his liability by then, but after six weeks he has the money. We have given him up to three months before interest starts running. In that period he can negotiate with the Inland Revenue as to what the tax might be or he might make a payment on account which relieves the 9 per cent. interest charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A period of three months is fair. If the period were extended it would make it more difficult for local authorities because they would have to pay interest for a longer period. Local authorities will have to pay interest immediately on amounts deducted from compensation on account of DLT before the reckonable date. To put back the reckonable date, as proposed in the amendment, would make it more difficult for local authorities, which would have to pay out more by way of interest on advance payments of DLT, because they would have to pay up to the reckonable date. If the conveyance took place before the reckonable date as in most cases it would do so because of the six-week general rule about conveyances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For those two reasons we think three months is reasonable because the vendor has his money and can pay the tax. Secondly, in extending it to a year or any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1565</span>
period longer than three months may make life more difficult for local authorities who have to pay more interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon Gentlemens have shown great concern for local authorities and the need to ensure that they can buy their land quickly. This is one of the areas on which we have reached agreement in the Bill. There have been numerous amendments to assist local authorities. The amendment would not help local authorities, but would make life more difficult for them. It would cost more to buy land and would prevent progress. We think three months is a fair period, striking a reasonable balance between the need to ensure that the revenue is collected fairly quickly and the needs of local authorities, and takes into account the fact that the taxpayer has his money and in most cases can pay the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to make a few remarks partly of inquiry but also of complaint. The Minister has said that it might cost local authorities more if there were a longer period before the reckonable date and this would benefit nobody, but surely by definition it would benefit the taxpayer. Although he frequently suggests that we have a wild enthusiasm for the Bill and the opportunity which it gives for local authorities to acquire land under it, he well knows that we have serious reservations not only about the procedure but about the underlying principles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points which arise from the definition of "reckonable date" need to be considered in the context of what is the date of disposal and what is the nature of the other event which might give rise to liability to development land tax. In Clause 44 we were looking at various artificial disposal dates and, to take but one of them, the time when an authority enters on to land in pursuance of compulsory purchase powers is for this purpose the date of disposal. It might be a long time before a figure were agreed as to compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wonder whether this unwittingly includes a deemed disposal. Although there are specific provisions for tax not to be due for a period of a year and then by instalments, as it stands it would appear to suggest that the reckonable date in such a case is three months after the occurrence of the deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should therefore like to hear the Minister's comments on how the inter-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1566</span>
pretation of the date of the disposal, when it is not actually the disposal but just the deemed date of disposal, fits in, and also how this is expected to operate where there is another event giving rise to liability other than the disposal whose date is established for this purpose.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point here is that the reckonable date does run from the deemed disposal, because they are deemed disposals for the purposes of the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the "other event", if it is the compensation payment or it was an entry by the authority, that is a chargeable occasion in itself, but there would be no interest running on DLT which is collected by deduction. Again, of course, interest is not charged on the DLT which has been collected, because it has been collected. Interest does not run in the case of local authority collection of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the hon Gentleman's main question, however, the answer is "Yes". The three-month period runs from the deemed disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of when the period starts to run, particularly in cases of compulsory acquisition and agreement of compensation and entry by the acquiring authority, we are told in Clause 44—we discussed this earlier—that the date of the disposal is the date of agreeing compensation. So three months after the date of agreeing compensation—there is no provision that he may have received the compensation in that time—he becomes liable for interest on that money. It is the same with the date of entry. This is corrected, of course, if we get the amendments to Clause 44 that I was forecasting. But as the definition of "the reckonable date" stands, it really is most depressing when there is a date of—I do not like to call it "deemed disposal" because that is a word of art; "artificial disposal" is probably the best that one can choose, certainly under some subsections of Clause 44 and then one adds the words
	<br><q><p>"or other event which gives rise to that liability".</p></q>
What other event? I thought that the liability arose only in the case of disposal or something which throughout the Bill has been called disposal. Even, say, the example of the mortgagee foreclosing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1408">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1567</span>
is said to be a disposal under the Bill, so it is not an
	<br><q><p>"other event which gives rise to that liability".</p></q>
This seems, therefore, to be an abundance of caution on the part of the draftsmen of the Bill—caution in favour of the Inland Revenue and not in favour of the chargeable person.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can make that point clear again. Although a person who suffers development land tax by deduction is treated—I am concerned here with local authority acquisition—by Clause 38(5)(	<i>b</i>)
	<br><q><p>"as having paid…an amount of development land tax equal to the DLT deduction"—</p></q>
he is not charged with interest for the period between the reckonable date and the date of deduction. The date of the deduction will not normally be under his control and it would be unreasonable, as the right hon. Gentleman argued, to expect him to pay interest if delay in making the deduction were due to the acquiring authority being dilatory, especially as the interest would eventually accrue to the authority's benefit. So in no case will he pay any interest between the reckonable date and the date of deduction if the reckonable date happens to be sooner than the date of deduction.

	<p>'The transfer of a business to a company in circumstances where the provisions of paragraph 15(1) of the 19th Schedule to the Finance Act 1969 are satisfied shall be treated as a devolution of an interest in land falling within the provisions of section 9 above as if references to the deceased were references to the person or persons carrying on the business and references to the personal representatives were references to the company to which the business is transferred'.—(	<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>)</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take New Clause 5—	<i>Transfer of business to a company.</i>
	<br><q><p>'(1) This section shall apply where a person who is not a company transfers to a company a business as a going concern, together with the whole assets of the business, or together with the whole of those assets other than cash, and the business is so transferred wholly or partly in exchange for shares issued by the company to the person transferred the business and any realised development value accrues to the transferor in respect of that disposal (referred to below as "the original disposal"). Any shares so received by the transferor in exchange for the business are referred to below as "the new assets".</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(2) For the purposes of this section—
	<ol>
	<li>"realised development value" means the realised development value accruing to the transferor in respect of the original disposal.</li>
	<li>"the qualifying amount"</li>
	<ol>
	<li>if the business is transferred wholly in exchange for shares issued by the company to the transferor means the amount of the realised development value;</li>
	<li>in any other case shall be a fraction A/B of the amount of the realised development value where "A" is the cost of the new assets and "B" is the value of the consideration received by the transferor in exchange for the business and for the purposes of this sub-paragraph "the cost of the new assets" means any sums which would be allowable as a deduction under paragraph 4(1)(	<i>a</i>) of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1965 if the new assets were disposed of as a whole in circumstances giving rise to a chargeable gain.'</li>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1571</span>
	<li>the qualifying amount shall be apportioned between the new assets as a whole, and, if those shares are not all of the same class, the apportionment between them shall be in accordance with their market values at the time they were acquired by the transferor.</li>
</ol></p></q>
	<br><q><p>(3) The realised development value chargeable on the transferor for the financial year in which the original disposal is made shall be reduced by the qualifying amount.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(4) If the transferor disposes of shares comprised in the new assets, being all the shares of a particular class which are so comprised, then the amount apportioned to those shares under paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of subsection (2) above shall be treated as realised development value accruing to him in the financial year in which that disposal is made.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(5) If the transferor disposes of shares comprised in the new assets, being some but not all of the shares of a particular class which are so comprised (so that the disposal constitutes a part disposal) then a fraction only of the amount apportioned to all the shares of that class under sub-paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of sub-section (2) above shall be treated as mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and that fraction shall be the fraction of the sums mentioned in the following sub-paragraph which is allowable as a deduction in computing under Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1965 the amount of the gain accruing on that disposal.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>(6) The sums referred to in the preceding subparagraph are the sums which, if all the shares of the class in question comprised in the new assets remaining undisposed of immediately before the time of the part disposal in question had been disposed of at that time, would be allowable by virtue of paragraph 4(1)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) of the said Schedule 6 as a deduction in computing under that Schedule the gain accruing on the disposal of all those shares'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: New Clause 5 is on exactly the same topic. I do not think that there is a material difference. It is certainly intended to deal, perhaps a little more elaborately and in detail, with the principle set out in new Clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a principle which surely follows from new Clause 11, which the Minister has just had inserted in the Bill. New Clause 11 dealt with the amalgamation and reconstruction of businesses, recognising that when that is done it is not an occasion to be treated as a disposal and acquisition of property belonging to the companies which are amalgamated or reconstructed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 4 deals not with two companies or two statutory bodies which are rearranging their affairs, but with the case of the individual or partnership which has operated as a unit, as a business, and which wishes to convert itself into a limited
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1572</span>
liability company. The limited liability might be accompanied by guarantee or something of that sort. But it is a transfer from the individual or individuals to a company. This is recognised in other spheres of taxation as not giving rise to the normal provisions when property is transferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that in connection with the development land tax we can have the same sort of consideration for the partnership or the individual who wish to convert themselves into the company formation. This is happening many times every day. The firm seeks limited liability where, up to that time, it has been trading with complete liability falling on the members of that firm. That, surely, is a matter which we have always encouraged in our law. There are the full provisions of the law to enable a partnership of limited liability, and, as I said, that opportunity is taken on many occasions. Such a move allows for ensiderable growth of the business, and I hope that It will be recognised in the Bill as desirable and thereby escape the taxation which would otherwise arise by treating this as a disposal and acquisition of property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my right hon. Friend. In many cases it could well happen that, unless there were such a provision in the Bill, a business owned by an individual, or group of individuals, could not be converted into a company. Where the conversion takes place by the issue of shares in that company, as is usually the case, there is no monetary consideration out of which tax could be paid. Because businesses might have held the same property for a number of years there could be a potentially high liability to development land tax due to changes in the environment or changes in the demand for property in the town or area where the prmises are situated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the operation is nothing more than the incorporation of what is already in existence, it seems that a charge to development land tax to fall at the point where the technical arrangements of incorporation are made could lead to a heavy liability on the chargeable person without that person having any means of settling it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential to have provision in the Bill as is suggested in new Clauses 4 or 5—which incidentally deal with the case
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1573</span>
where some of the consideration is not in shares, and we have taken that into account. Without such a provision certain businesses might be encouraged—encouraged is perhaps the wrong word: they might be forced—to stay in an unincorporated state but it would not be in their interests to do so. In the long run it might not be in the Revenue's interests either, because in many cases it is just a matter of size and development over a period of rime, and generally corporate taxpayers are more convenient for the Revenue to deal with than unincorporated taxpayers over a while range of liabilities to tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we believe that it is right to have a provisions such as that proposed in new Clause 4. It would not breach even the purest principles of the development land tax as conceived by the Department of the Environment, because no disposal of any kind is taking place. Although it could be described as a disposal, it is merely the transfer within the same basic ownership from a personal direct holding to a holding in the shares of the company. We feel that there is a strong case, to which we hope the Government are receptive, for enabling devolution on transfer of a business to a company not to be an occasion for the charge of development land tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I deal with the arguments on New Clauses 4 and 5, I should like to make a short statement relating to New Clauses 11 which was moved formally and accepted, because the two new clauses to some extent relate to New Clause 11 and to Opposition's New Clause 9.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the debate on company amalgamations and reconstructions I believe I said that New Clause 9 and New Clause 11 were practically identical. I should correct any mistake I made by saying that New Clause 9, which was tabled by the Opposition, went somewhat further than New Clause 11 because it would have provided relief for cases which are not strictly reconstructions of the type covered by New Clause 11.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have misled the Committee in suggesting that they both covered the same kind of situation. An example is the creation of new companies whose shareholdings do not exactly match the shareholdings in the original companies.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1574</span>
In practice, bona fide reconstructions of this type are, for capital gains tax purposes, treated as if they fell within Section 267 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970—that is, the capital gains tax provision corresponding to new Clause 11. In practice these reconstructions are treated as falling within Section 267 now, for capital gains tax purposes. In law many of them probably would not fall within the strict wording of Section 267, but the Revenue gives clearance in some of these cases where there is a bona fide reconstruction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to put on record that the intention is to follow the same practice as is now followed for capital gains tax purposes for DLT in these amalgamations where the shareholdings are not matched. Because of the wide range of situations that can arise, it would be extremely difficult to frame satisfactory statutory provisions which would not be inordinately lengthy and complex. That applies to capital gains tax as much as to this legislation. As I said, there is a procedure whereby clearance is given under Section 267 for that kind of situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 11 does not cover that sort of situation but, in practice, we shall follow the same procedures as in Section 267 of the 1970 Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now refer to new Clauses 4 and 5. This is an important subject, and although I do not want to detain the Committee, I should deal with the matter in some detail. The two new clauses are not exactly the same but I should like to show the genuine difficulties—hon. Gentlemans might say that that is our problem as it is our tax—of framing this kind of relief to cover the situations which they envisage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 4 provides that where a person transfers a business to a company, that transfer should not rank as disposal of an interest in land for DLT purposes, and the acts of the person shall be treated as the acts of the company. This means that the transferor will never have any DLT to bear in consequence of the transfer, even though part of the consideration may be cash; nor will there be any liability if and when he disposes of the shares. On a subsequent disposal of an interest in land by the company the base values will be derived from the transferor's acquisition cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 5 is different in that it is based on the full capital gains tax rules as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1575</span>
set out in Paragraph 15 of Schedule 19 of the Finance Act 1969. Unlike new Clause 4, the transfer is regarded as a DLT disposal, but there are certain reliefs. It provides that on such a transfer the realised development value is reduced by a "qualifying amount"—again, that is the capital gains tax language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 4 in effect provides that the transfer should be ignored, so that no tax arises at that point, and the company is enabled to look through to the acquisition cost of the transferor for the purposes of any subsequent disposal. Under new Clause 5 the transfer remains a DLT disposal, but the development value realised by the transferor is reduced according to the extent to which the transfer proceeds are in the form of shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new clauses are not acceptable for a number of reasons. However, we are looking at the problem, and we shall bring forward an amendment on Report to to try to deal with it. I do not want the Committee to be under any illusions about the difficulty of drafting a new clause to cover every eventuality, and I do not think our amendment will go as far as the new clauses would require. However, I shall outline the difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under New Clause 4 the transferor completely escapes DLT, despite the fact that he may have realised development value. The company will not be able to use the consideration it gave for base value purposes. In fact, there will be no arrangements for picking up the tax at a later stage. The arrangements under New Clause 5 are inadequate in that nothing is triggered when the company disposes of its interest in land itself and the transferor may have no intention of selling the shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of New Clause 5, which follows the capital gains tax rule, I remind hon. Gentlemans that capital gains tax is concerned with other assets besides land. We discussed this on a previous tax avoidance provision. We are concerned here, in DLT, only with disposals of land—not the disposal of shares. That is why it is extremely impractical to follow the capital gains tax example in relation to DLT. The development value may, in effect, be realised by share transactions as well as the disposal of the interest in land itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For later transations it is necessary to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1576</span>
have regard both to the shares received by the shareholder for his business and the assets transferred to the company—that is, the interest in land itself. Moreover, the arrangements under which a company may take over a business in return for shares can take a wide variety of forms. The example most commonly put forward is that of the individual who transfers his business to a company in which he becomes the sole or principal shareholder. But that is just one example, and the simplest at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other arrangements may involve a partnership, as the hon. Gentleman has argued, or two or more businesses joining together, or an individual contributing his business while other shareholders put up finance, or, an existing company taking over the business for shares. These possibilities can shade into each other and in each case the consideration may be a mixture of cash and shares, or different classes of shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under DLT it is also necessary to determine whether, and to what extent, any deferred liability should be triggered by transfers of this sort. New Clause 5 makes no provision for this. I may criticise the new clauses but I put that on record. It is not as easy to deal with this kind of relief for DLT as it might have been for capital gains tax. This is extremely complicated, and my recollection is that in the original legislation of 1965 there was no wide capital gains tax relief and it has had to be modified from time to time ever since.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with a different tax where the assets might not be land, but shares, and we have to provide for all eventualities. However, we are discussing with Parliamentary Counsel the best way to deal with this problem, giving the constraints, and we shall bring forward an amendment on Report. I do not wish right hon. and hon. Gentlemans to gain the impression that it will be on all fours with the amendments they have tabled. There are difficulties which the new clauses have not anticipated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for saying that this is being considered and that he will bring forward an amendment on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I revert to what he said about New Clause 11 and New Clause 9, which I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1577</span>
should like to consider further to see to what extent the practice could be embodied in the clause. I say that because my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) is not present at the moment but I am sure that he would rise to complain about matters being put into practice notes and extra-statutory notes. At the time I realised that New Clause 9 went a little further than New Clause 11, but we were grateful to the Minister for having put down a clause for amalgamation and reconstruction, and our gratitude remains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the difficulty in framing a clause to fit the case of the transfer of business from a partnership to a company, or from an individual to a new company. The simple way, embodied in New Clause 4, is to disregard it. That will give the solution, if one is satisfied that there is no difference in the assets with which one is dealing. The question of following the land into the shares is complicated. The question of triggering off in a deferred liability, the Minister said, was complicated. I am not sure that I agree with him. One could say that a partnership is not deprived of its deferred liability by forming itself into a company, provided that it is the same business and there is no wangle over the assets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plump for the easier solution of treating the transfer from an individual to a company, or from individuals to a company, as we have treated a gift. For the base one goes back to the acquisition by the individual and disregards the process of transfer to the company altogether as being not a disposal and not an acquisition. I agree that one would have to consider whether the assets change and whether it would be a transfer of business, or whether the sum effort is to overcome the eventual payment of tax when that property may be disposed of subsequently. I am sure it is not beyond the wit of the draftsmen to produce something of this nature at a later stage, and we look forward to seeing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If my hon. Friends do not wish to comment further, and on the assurances which the Minister has given us, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the proposed clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Motion and clause, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to New Clause 10—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1578</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. If we embark on new Clause 10 and the other proposed new clauses, we may linger beyond our fixed time. I imagine that on these important points we shall have time and more convenience to look into them on Report. Unless my hon. Friends have any objection, I do not wish to move any further new clauses, in the hope that we may conclude our proceedings in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, having said that, the Minister will not take advantage of me on Report, and that we shall have a decent time to consider these matters. When we reach new clauses of this sort it is necessary to go back over the Bill to talk about them intelligently and wisely. Between now and Report we shall have a chance to do that and to see what the Minister will put on the Amendment Paper. However, at this stage we shall not move any more new clauses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the Chairman do report the Bill, as amended, to the House.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. First, let me give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance that on Report, or on any other occasion, I shall not seek to take advantage of him. He has been a Member of this House far too long for anyone to do that. But he will appreciate that Departmental Ministers are not entirely in control of Government business. However, so far as it is in my power, we shall endeavour to have as long a debate on Report as is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that we have come to the termination of our proceedings, I thank you. Mr. Crawshaw, for the relaxed and efficient way in which you have dealt with this long and complicated Bill. I also thank the Clerk and the Officers of the House for their hard work. I thank, too, my hon. Friends for their unstinting devotion in sitting on this Committee voluntarily, having shown their interest in the subject on Second Reading. Without their presence, this Bill would not be leaving this Committee in the good shape that it now has.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank the Opposition for their constructive approach, especially the right hon. Gentleman, who, I say most sincerely, has been a great help. Although he picks up one's bad points very quickly,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1414">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1579</span>
when one makes a good point, he is gracious enough to admit it. If the Bill is technically better going out of Committee than it was when it came into Committee, I think the right hon. Gentleman and hon. Gentlemans, too, deserve our thanks and tribute.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join the Minister, Mr. Crawshaw, in thanking you for your conduct of this Committee. You have always kept in a good temper with us, even though we have been very tedious and repetitious and sometimes not known where we were in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask you to convey our thanks to the three other Chairmen who have taken the Chair here—Mr. Costain, Mr. Fitch and, for one Session, Mr. Bonner Pink. We are very grateful to them all. The Committee has taken place in good humour, thanks to the way in which the Chair has been held.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time when were dealing with the mandarins of Middlesborough, I thought that someone would be tempted to refer to you, Mr. Crawshaw, as Mr. Craw Rickshaw, but we refrained from doing so. At one time we got a little muddled over the nationality of the mandarins, in talking about the gentlemen of Japan in the palace of Titipu. I looked up the definition of mandarins in the encyclopedia and found that they were the civil servants and tax collectors of China—and what is more, that they came from the North. So we are quite right in refering to the mandarins of Middlesborough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I thank those on your left, Mr. Crawshaw—the Clerk and 	<i>Hansard.</i> I also thank those on your right. The Minister has not seen the appreciative nods and smiles which we have received from time to time from his own advisers. I am most grateful for the way in which they have fed the Minister so that he might answer our questions. Of course, I am grateful to those behind the Minister and those alongside him for their silence. I am grateful for their patience in listening to our voices on this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for my colleagues, they could not have been constructive if they had not studied the Bill very carefully and put forward the points that they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming back to yourself, Mr. Crawshaw, thank you so much for the very efficient way in which you have chaired the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1580</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister and the right hon. Gentleman for their kind tributes. I shall certainly convey their thanks to my colleagues, particularly to Mr. Fitch, who really bore the heat and burden of the day at the beginning when the Committee was more onerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make a personal reference to the standard of debate on both sides of the Committee. At times the high technical knowledge which has been displayed has been amazing. Anyone who has had the pleasure of listening and understanding what has been going on, has seen Committee work at its best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the sympathetic understanding which has been shown of my position as Chairman. It has been a very good Committee to control, and that certainly would not have been possible without the help of my Clerk. Without his help, it would have been a very difficult Committee to deal with. I express my own appreciation, but I think I speak on behalf of all those who have wished to table amendments, and so on. We have all received ready help from him, and we do not appreciate that help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before you finally sit down, Mr. Crawshaw, and draw our proceedings to a close, may I briefly support what has been said by the Minister and my right hon. Friend about yourself and all those who have been responsible for the conduct of the Committee. But we should not leave without a word for the one person who seems to have received no tribute at this stage—and that is the Minister. We have been fortunate to have the ablest of the Treasury Ministers to deal with this immensely complex legislation. His feat in conducting the Committee almost single-handed on behalf of the Government should not go without a proper word of appreciation from this side of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I say that, without the help of the Minister, the Committee could have lasted twice as long. I say that in all sincerity. It has been a pleasure to see the ability with which the case has been argued on both sides.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
