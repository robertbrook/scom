</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Here we are again. We start on a new clause—Clause 6—where we are concerned with the valuable and significant concession which is designed to be of assistance to vendors. The Committee will realise that there are basically two separate concessions in the clause as drafted. If the land was owned on White Paper day—12th September 1974—base A can be increased by 15 per cent. for each year before development takes place, up to a maximum of four years, or 60 per cent. If the land was bought between White Paper day and 1st May 1977, the proposed addition is to be 10 per cent. per year, up to a maximum of 40 per cent.<br><br>
As a series of amendments have been grouped together and as most of them deal with the problem in a slightly different
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 440</span>
way, I shall try to deal with each in turn.<br><br>
Amendment No. 55 would take out the requirement that the land has to be acquired before 1st May 1977, and it is therefore of relevance to the 10 per cent. addition. The purpose of the special addition is presumably to offset financing costs, and it is far from obvious why there should be a time limit on such a concession. The date appears to be entirely arbitrary, and I see no reason why it is necessary to have such a date at all.<br><br>
At the conclusion of describing each amendment I shall say a brief word about financing costs in general.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 78 and 79, as the Committee will realise, are fall-back positions. If the idea of eliminating the date 1st May 1977 altogether does not appeal to the Government, the Opposition suggest two alternatives. One is All Fools Day 1984—a year of Orwellian fame, by which time the complete workers' State will have been created if this Government remain in office—[<i>Interruption.</i>]—I say that without delight or expectation. The other proposed alternative is St. George's Day 1978, which seems a fine patriotic date to symbolise the return of a Conservative Government. It is also Shakespeare's reputed birthday, and the prospect of the continuation of this Government brings to mind Richard II's remark on his abdication.
<br><blockquote><p>"Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs … Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth."</p></blockquote>
Most of the earth will be socialised, anyway, if the Community Land Act comes into operation.<br><br>
Those are the alternatives we propose in Amendments Nos. 78 and 79.<br><br>
Amendment No. 80 would extend the number of years for which the concession is available from four to six. It is a particularly important amendment. Six years is far more appropriate regarding the larger land assemblies which often take longer than four years to bring to fruition, especially as considerable planning delays often occur.<br><br>
It is unreasonable when one considers, that in documents such as "The Strategic Plan for the South-East" it is envisaged that large tracts of land will be assembled for development in the growth areas. For example, where land has been purchased with planning consent for 1,000 houses, but infrastructure or other considerations
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0807">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 441</span>
require a planning condition that the houses should be built at, say, 100 per year—which is a perfectly normal phasing condition for local authorities to impose—it will be seen how ridiculous is the four-year limitation in relation to financing costs. I believe that our proposal for six years would be much fairer.<br><br>
Amendment No. 52 would scrap the requirement that land has to be bought before 12th September 1974, the White Paper day, if it is to get the 15 per cent. per year addition or, alternatively, the 10 per cent. addition if bought before 1st May 1977. The amendment attempts to meet the method of financing carrying charges by giving a 60 per cent. addition to base value in every case.<br><br>
Amendments No. 98 and Amendment No. 99 are selected separately and deal with a different point and no doubt, Mr. Fitch, we shall reach these later.<br><br>
That leaves Amendments No. 56, 57, which are amendments to Schedule 2, and which are consequential on the earlier amendments which the Opposition have put down.<br><br>
Before saying a few brief words on the question of financing costs, I refer to an important point which is not the subject of our amendment, although it would be met by the amendment which seeks to delete dates altogether. It is a subject which has been raised in submissions to the Committee by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. This says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In our memorandum on the Inland Revenue statement of February 1975, we said that it would be more equitable to use 4th February 1975 as the qualifying date for the purpose of the special addition in Clause 6(2) to base (a). The addition was not announced until 4th February 1975 in the Inland Revenue Press Statement, and so purchasers of interests in land after 12th September 1974 but before 4th February 1975 could have had no knowledge of the differential rates until the latter date."</p></blockquote>
I think that is a fair point, too. It would be met if the Committee were to accept Amendment No. 52.<br><br>
I turn briefly to the question of carrying charges generally. I am not looking a gift horse in the mouth. I appreciate that Clause 6 is an important concession. It cannot be said too often that the private house-building industry in particular—I have no specialist knowledge of commercial development, although other members of the Committee have—is necessarily a highly-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 442</span>
geared industry. The buying of land in order to allow development to take place must clearly be done by borrowing, and the repayment of the mortgage which has been raised by the land must come entirely from cash flow from sales of the houses. So there are many points during the process of development when the developer is in a dangerously highly-geared situation should the market change quickly, as it often does in house building and when the developer is exposed to additional carrying charges. The viability of his business can be messed up if the market situation changes at a time when he is most highly geared.<br><br>
Interest rates have dropped recently, although they may increase again. However, a multiplier of 10, such as is suggested for the four years under the provisions for land bought since White Paper day, is certainly unlikely to do anything to compensate fully for interest paid, bearing in mind that many developers will still be financing the construction of the land which they bought at higher rates.<br><br>
I hope that I have explained the amendments fully. They are important amendments, and I hope that the Government will not think us churlish in asking them to go further than Clause 6, but the Opposition believe that the Government are not wholly seized of the importance to the developer of financing carrying charges.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) spelt out in detail the reason for the amendments. They all deal with the concession, which he accepts as being reasonably generous, in relation to the special addition. The amendments, in their diverse forms, seek to extend the concession.<br><br>
Amendment No. 55 seeks to make the concession permanent. Other dates are chosen, designed to give a longer period, and in one case the date chosen is 1st April 1984. In another case I believe that St. George's Day is chosen as being a patriotic date. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman was not correct in choosing that date, because we should also have to choose St. Andrew's Day and St. David's Day to ensure that we got the correct date. We might have problems with Scots and tradition. Therefore I do not know if St. George's Day is a good date to choose. The hon. Gentleman also seeks to extend
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0808">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 443</span>
the four years to six years.<br><br>
May I say at the outset that I do not see that the Government can accept the amendments. The concession as it stands is generous and recognises problems which arose a few years ago. It recognises that developers did suffer.—[<i>Laughter</i>] I do not want to bring party political points into the discussion, even if I were allowed to do so, but if I were to introduce party political points I would say that I have great sympathy with developers. People who bought land in 1971 and 1972 operated as developers operate. The fault for what happened lies with the previous Tory Government. I have never criticised capitalists for operating as capitalists. I expect them to operate as capitalists, but the problems of 1971 and 1972 occurred as a result of what the Tory Government did.<br><br>
As a result of what the Tory Government did, they saddled developers with enormous burdens, and the blame does not lie entirely with people who relied on the previous Government and who hoped and thought that the previous Government were one of sound fiscal management, which they were not. As a result, such people suffered, and they still suffer.<br><br>
In order to compensate developers to some extent we have introduced a special addition because of the high cost of borrowing and the commitments those people introduced during that period. In good faith many of them relied on policies of the previous Government which after a while destroyed many property companies and caused great difficulties. That is why we introduced this special addition to help developers finance acquisitions that were made during a very difficult period.<br><br>
The hon. Member talked about the costs of builders and the cost of borrowing. We accept entirely that builders, like other business men and those in other industries, have costs of borrowing. But the learned Gentleman should not forget costs of borrowing are generally allowable for Corporation Tax purposes. When a builder incurs costs in relation to borrowing, in most cases he gets relief for that cost against his profit. If he makes a profit on the sale of his houses, he will normally be allowed a deduction in relation to the cost of borrowing.<br><br>
We are not talking about denying or tapering off this cost in relation to builders' profits. We are merely talking about the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 444</span>
cost of financing the cost of the land itself, which was bought in many cases at a time when land prices were extremely high—artificially high—and when interest rates were high and costs of financing were considerable. This is an addition to the present general situation where interest payments, in general, are deductible by a developer or builder when he develops.<br><br>
This concession is a reasonable one. The dates we have chosen are to some extent arbituary. I am not going to defend these dates and say that they are not arbritary. Any date one chooses must, in the order of things, be arbitrary. We have thought that a period of four years is reasonable. The dates chosen in Clause 6–1st May1977 and 30th September, 1974—are reasonable dates. These periods, in view of the background and the reason this concession is being introduced, are recognised as reasonable by most people who made representations to us.<br><br>
Obviously the taxpayer would like the concession to be extended. There is nothing wrong in representations being made for more concessions, but at the end of the day the Inland Revenue and the Government will then have to decide what is fair, not only to the particular taxpayer, but to taxpayers in general and what is fair to the country. We think that we have arrived at what is a reasonably fair compromise, giving developers considerable and generous reliefs to compensate them for a difficult time when they acquired land at high rates of interest and high cost.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the representation of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in relation to the debate 4th February 1975. He said that that should be the date and not 13th September 1974. I do not promise to accept what he said. I have not listened to the argument before. I will look into it. I cannot say any more than that and I am not holding out any hope. As I had not come across this point before, it is only fair to the Committee that I should look into it and consult with a view to seeing whether it is possible to do something about it. At the moment, my inclination is to leave the dates as they are.<br><br>
I am sorry that I have not been more forthcoming, but we have gone a long way to give relief. Therefore, it would not be fair if we went further and accepted one or any of these amendments, all of which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0809">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 445</span>
seek to extend the time.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Tages</span><span class='membercontribution'> The Minister will realise that his answer was extremely disappointing and contained very little logic. Let me pose a number of questions and then perhaps I may develop the point.<br><br>
Why is this a temporary matter and not permanent, if it is worth while at all? Why 1st May 1977? I can develop that into three queries—why the 1st, why May, and why 1977? The date seems to have been plucked entirely out of the air, except that in future we are to have a bank holiday on 1st May, as I understand the situation.<br><br>
Why reduce the figure from 15 per cent. to 10 per cent., dependent upon the date of publication of the White Paper? Incidentally, I do not think that it was known at the date of the White Paper that there was to be this variation of figures. Perhaps those are enough questions to go on with.<br><br>
I start with the date 1st May 1977. If the argument is that this is intended to recompense the owner of land for the cost of financing the land itself when costs were high, why extend it to 1977? Subsection (1) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"where the chargeable person acquired that interest before 1st May 1977."</p></blockquote>
I do not want the Minister to say "We shall go back and take a much earlier earlier date". I am merely trying to follow the logic of his argument. The Opposition wish a special addition of this kind to be recognised as permanent, and not for it merely to be temporary expendient. That is the issue that divideds the two sides of the Committee. Obviously the Government have been fishing about to find some reasonable figures and dates for what they call a temporary relief for those who bought land when prices were high.<br><br>
The Opposition look on this special addition as a valuable, fair and permanent concession—if it be such—to those who are holding land for a period of time before it is possible to develop it—the cost, if I may put in this way, of the interest on the money.<br><br>
The Minister said "Never mind about the cost in the form of the interest on the money, because that is allowed to developers in the computation of corpora-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 446</span>
tion tax or, if they are individuals, of income tax as charged to them." We are not talking about those people. We are talking, as he later said, about those who are holding land and who purchased land some time ago when costs were high. That is the difference between the Government's view and the Opposition's view.<br><br>
The Opposition would like the concession to be recognised as a permanent need for those who purchase land and hold it. After all, this tax is a tax on gains out of the development of land. I know that we have changed the name from "development gains tax" to "Development Land Tax", but what the Government seek to do is to tax the windfall profits which a landowner makes on the realisation of the land he holds. Therefore, it is right to take into account the expense that a person has incurred in holding that land, either by keeping his capital idle for a period or by having borrowed the capital in order to acquire the land. It is right to recognise that such an operation costs money and detracts from the gain which the owner makes on the disposal of the land.<br><br>
The special addition seemed at first to recognise the fact that the gain out of disposal of the land is reduced by the interest paid on the money borrowed, or the interest that there might have earned been on the money invested in the land. If we look on it as a permanent concession, it may be that the fixed figures of 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. would remain correct for ever. I imagine that the ideas behind the clause, namely, of making it temporary, are that after four years the person would be able to borrow money free of interest, the concession would be wiped out, and there would be no cost to a person who borrowed money to acquire land, or to hold land with his own money idle for the period needed to proceed with development. I cannot believe that that is the theory behind the proposal.<br><br>
If it were accepted that this should be a permanent form of concession, or a realisation of the fact that there are debits against the profits being made out of the development of the land, we could not expect the rate of interest to remain static at 15 per cent. or 10 per cent. Again, this is an arbitrary reduction from 15 per cent. to 10 per cent. However, that could be altered from time to time in the annual Finance Bill. I suggest that we do not need to put anything in this Bill to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0810">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 447</span>
say that the figure can be altered by Order or in some other way. The figure could be altered as is normal with changes in taxation. The figures of 15 per cent. and 10 per cent. can be adjusted from time to time according to the cost of money.<br><br>
Here, however, we are faced with the position that the Government say "The money will not cost anything for you to borrow after four years."<br><br>
We should prefer the first amendment, which seeks to delete the date 1st May 1977, so that the concession may be made permanent, and to delete the maximum of four years against the letter D.<br><br>
Incidentally, here we come to more letters to try to interpret. By the time we reach the end of the Bill I daresay that we shall have run through the entire alphabet. I commend to the Paymaster-General this little doggerel:
<br><blockquote><p>"We already have the CGT on increased CUV
And when we RIP our PRs pay the CTT.
Before we phase out DGT and phase in DLT
Please tell us: Will the PMG consult the TUC?"</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can add little to what I said earlier. One reason for tapering off the relief is that under this Government interest rates have been falling rapidly over the past year or so, and we are hopeful that they will continue to fall.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: They may start rising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mutters something about "start rising". But he knows as well as anyone that no one can be certain in matters of this kind. At some future time we might have a Government representing the Conservatives, and no doubt we should again have the same kind of boom-bust situation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</span> <span class='membercontribution'><i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will give way soon. As I was saying, we should probably again have the same kind of boom-bust situation while the Conservatives were in office, despite their mutterings now that they are monetarists and that they believe in a sound fiscal and monetary policy. No doubt these times, figures and dates could be changed in a future Finance Bill to reflect new situations. But at present interest rates and inflation are falling and land prices are not skyrocketing but levelling off, having come down from their previous
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 448</span>
high levels.<br><br>
In this situation of reduced interest rates and stabilisation of land prices, we believe it is only right that there should be a tapering relief that will come to an end by 1977, but of course, if the position changed by that date this matter could be looked at again. I want to make it quite clear that this was meant as a temporary relief to cover that kind of situation, and we do not envisage the necessity of having to change it again to provide for these high costs. I now give way to the learned Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Badger).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am afraid the hon. Gentleman has not bought me off with such a small matter. If I may, I shall reply to what he has said at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is now at a loss for words—[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am glad that the hon. Gentleman was convinced by the strength of my argument.<br><br>
There is another point of principle here. We are giving developers—very worthy people who contribute enormously to the country's wellbeing—a special allowance. But there are other people who have to borrow money and pay higher interest rates. Sometimes they get relief within the tax system for doing so, and sometimes they do not. Here we are quite rightly giving an extra relief, but the hon. Gentleman wants a permanent extra relief on top of the present reliefs. At the end of the day it is a matter of fairness and equity. Why should we be asked to single out one section of the community to give extra relief on a permanent basis over and above reliefs which may be available to others? There has been a special situation here. That is why we give a special addition, but I do not accept that it should be made permanent.<br><br>
To repeat, we think that this is fair. It is a tapering relief that reflects the fall in interest rates and the stabilisation of the land market. If in future things turn out differently and we come to the same situation as under the previous Government—hopefully we shall not while this Government are in office—we can adjust the rates in any Finance Bill, and it could be done in the 1977 Finance Bill if it was considered necessary. But I should not have thought it would be necessary; that is why we have said it should be a tapering relief, and I am

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 449</span>
not, therefore, in a position to accept any of these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State's arguments are based on the proposition that by 1977 the present Administration will still be in power and the rate of inflation will have been permanently reduced to a much lower level. As a consequence, he says, interest rates will have been reduced to a more normal level—perhaps he would describe as "normal" something around 5 per cent.—and we shall once again have the kind of stable economy that occurred in the much-maligned 13 years of Tory rule.<br><br>
The learned Gentleman may be right. But he began his analysis from a monetary standpoint. As someone who has argued from a monetary standpoint since at least 1969, and has spent a lot of time and created a good deal of embarrassment in the small circles in which I move—I do not pretend that I did any real damage, but I embarrassed a few friends—I can say that I spent a lot of time attacking Mr. Barber, as he then was, for his disgraceful Budget deficits. But we are now reaching the stage where it is no good just having a bit of fun at the expense of Lord Barber. He had a Budget deficit of only £4 billion, and we all attacked him upstairs and downstairs.<br><br>
We are now dealing with a Government who have a Budget deficit in the public sector borrowing requirements of £12 billion, and they have been very fortunate, in a period of recession, in being able to finance that borrowing requirement without printing money.<br><br>
11.0 a.m.<br><br>
But as we move towards what is said to be an upturn in the economy this coming autumn, we first see that the money supply figures are already starting to go up. Everybody knows that, come the autumn, the choice will be between either allowing the money supply figures to continue to expand and expand too fast, or do what Lord Barber did, and print the money, and 1977 will be a good time to see what happens.<br><br>
The reduction in the rate of inflation has nothing to do with the present Government. It is true that they have continued a policy started by the much-maligned Mr.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 450</span>
Barber on 17th December 1973, when he started to cut back on public expenditure and to reduce the money supply. It was a belated change of tack on both counts. The present Government have allowed public expenditure to go rip, but, because of the coincidental effect of a recession, they have been able to keep the money supply down. But it is absolute rubbish to pretend that we are moving towards a stable economy and a reduction in the rate of inflation.<br><br>
We will either see very high interest rates over the next couple of years, or money will be printed on a scale equalled only by the Weimar Republic. No one pretends that it will have an immediate effect; it will be effective in about 18 months' time, after the printing has taken place. It will have an effect in late 1977 or 1978. It is unfair for the Minister of State continually to attack Mr. Barber—bad Chancellor though he may have been—and then to avert his eyes from what is happening at present. The same analysis must be consistently applied to both Chancellors.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Regarding the amendments—[<i>Laughter</i>]—I am grateful to the Minister of State for his answers, although I cannot agree with them.<br><br>
The Minister of State said that other people have to borrow money, they have to pay tax on it, and therefore why should there be a further concession? It is true that people have to borrow money to finance their businesses, but they do not have to pay development land tax at the rate of 80 per cent.; they have to pay corporation tax at a rate of 52 per cent., or whatever. When one has a special tax, a special circumstance arises. That is why we object.<br><br>
My heart bled, and I could easily have followed my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), when the Minister claimed to be the developer's friend, rescuing him from those wicked Tories who so destroy the development industry. I am glad to hear such powerful support coming from the Government Front Bench.<br><br>
The Minister at no stage mentioned the Community Land Act, which surprised me. If the right hon. Gentleman who is Minister for Planning and Local Government—a position he holds today but may not hold tomorrow—had been in Committee replying to the amendment, I have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0812">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 451</span>
no doubt he would have said "The amendment is quite unnecessary and we should not have given you the concession, because the purpose of the Community Land Act is that the local authority will buy up all the land and resell it to builders who will not need to have a land bank at all. Therefore they will not have any financing charges. Clause 6 is, therefore, unnecessary." That is the argument that right hon. Gentleman would have applied. It is significant that the Minister of State did not even mention that, probably because, like me, he has doubts whether any resources will be available to implement the Community Land Act and he suspects that nothing will happen in that regard. So do I.<br><br>
Regarding the dates, the Minister said that there was no particular justification for the date 1st May 1977. While my right hon. Friend was addressing the Committee I took two seconds off to ask two of my hon. Friends whether they could remember the name of the musical in which Topol played the part of a Russian-Jewish peasant and from which the song "If I were a Rich Man" comes. The right hon. Gentleman did not know it either, he looks puzzled. It ran at the Haymarket Theatre for a long time. In that show the famous song asks</span></p>

<p>"Oh, Lord, who made the lion and the lamb,

<p>That was my question: whether it would spoil some vast eternal plan of the Government to change the dates from 1st May 1977 to a more reasonable or healthy date.</p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 98, in page 7, line 18, leave out 'subsection (5)' and insert 'subsections (5) and (6)'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment we are to take Amendment No. 99, in page 7, line 47, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(6) Where a deemed disposal and reacquisition of an interest in land takes place prior to 1st May 1977 subsection (4) above shall not apply but the special addition on a disposal which occurs after the deemed reacquisition shall be the higher of—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>a</i>) the amount referred to in subsection (5) above, or</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 98 is a paving amendment to No. 99, which is the substantive amendment.<br><br>
We are dealing here with the question that arises on subsections (5), (6) and (7), where on a deemed disposal
<br><blockquote><p>"base A of the relevant interest exceeds the net proceeds of disposal",</p></blockquote>
and the special addition provided for by the clause will continue to run beyond the date of deemed re-acquisition on part of the acquisition cost. Then there is a series of complicated calculations in subsection (7) as to how the fraction of partial development is to be calculated.<br><br>
Amendment No. 99 says that a person who acquires land between 1st August 1976—we assume that to be the operative day of the Bill, when enacted—and 1st May 1977 will be entitled to the special addition, even though it will be for only one year.<br><br>
There seems no logical reason why a person who is deemed to acquire land during this period should not have the same special addition and not be restricted to the amount provided for in Clause 6(5)—this fractional basis which I referred to a little while ago—which could be a</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 454</span>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 9.</p>
<p>lower basis. Our amendments would allow the taxpayer the higher of the Clause 6(5) addition or the special addition that would have applied had the land been purchased at market value at the time of the deemed disposal. In talking about deemed disposals throughout, we must remember that the deemed disposal is followed by the immediate re-acquisition, and that is how the tax is calculated.</p>
<p>This is a reasonable amendment. I do not believe it would make any significant difference to the Revenue. It would do something to ease the complications and possibly the unfairness of the fractional basis set out in subsection (7).</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These two amendments, as the hon. Gentleman said, seek to extend the special addition to cases where there have been a deemed disposal and re-acquisition—that is, to extend it generally to all those cases. As he rightly said, it is now possible to get the special addition even after a deemed disposal, where the base value in relation to that deemed disposal is higher than the realisable development value. The special addition then continues to run and there is a complicated calculation in order to apply it to future deemed disposals if they also create a no-gain situation.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman seeks to extend that situation to all deemed disposals, so that on a deemed disposal we should create a development value, and after the deemed disposal the special addition would continue to run. I am sorry to disappoint him by saying that we do not think we can go as far as he would require. We think it is reasonable that, once there is a re-acquisition a different situation arises. If the re-acquisition has not caused the developer to pay any extra costs or charges,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0814">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 455</span>
we think he should get that special addition only in relation to his original acquisition. But in the case of a deemed disposal, where there is a re-acquisition that does not involve any extra outlay, we consider it only reasonable that at that point the special addition should cease, subject to instances where the developer may have not made a gain on the re-acquisition.<br><br>
There is also the point that, on a deemed disposal of this kind, the base value becomes current use value on re-acquisition, so in fact the development value is moved into current use value. Unless there is future hope value, again there will not be a further charge very often in relation to future operations, because at the point of deemed disposal the development value then re-emerges in current use value, but this may not always be the case.<br><br>
I can see the hon. Gentleman's argument. He is asking why the addition should not be extended. But in some respects it would be artificial, because there is no real acquisition, although there is deemed acquisition, after deemed disposal: it is merely a re-acquisition for the purposes of computing liability, and the special addition was introduced to compensate developers for actual costs incurred in actual acquisition.</span></p>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State said that in some ways the amendment was artificial. Surely the whole idea of deemed disposal and re-acquisition is artificial. Indeed the clause as it stands is the height of artificiality. It presents the most extraordinary complications. Even the wettest of wet towels around the head does not help us to solve it. It is one of the most difficult clauses to understand, although I shall probably say that about many other clauses as we come to them. But this one is difficult.<br><br>
In our amendment, we suggest a fair and reasonable proposal for those who are saddled with the liability to tax by reason of starting a project of material development and thereby being assumed, artificially, to have made a disposal of land and to have re-acquired it at the moment after the project has started. I put this forward, as my hon. Friend has done so ably, hereby as a matter of justice to the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 456</span>
person who becomes liable to tax on the fictitious disposal of property.<br><br>
There is no reason why he should not receive the special addition in such circumstances. So I ask the Minister to look at this again. Indeed, we shall have to ask him to look again at the whole structure of this clause.<br><br>
It seems to be cheese-paring to have all these formulae and differences between what has been brought down to one basis in an earlier clause—that is, that this tax becomes payable whether a person really disposes of property by selling or leasing it, or is deemed to have disposed of it by starting a project of material development. Let us keep that simple point—if it is simple—running through the Bill, and when there is a deemed disposal let us try to put the person on the same basis as when there is actual disposal.<br><br>
This amendment has been given considerable thought outside the Committee, and it was in order to bring to the Committee's attention the thoughts of professional bodies and developers that Clause 6 could be made a little more fair to those involved with development that we tabled this amendment, and I would have hoped for a little more "hope value" in the Minister's reply to my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can add very little to what I said earlier, although I accept that there have been representations on this matter, and we have, of course, considered them. But it is extremely difficult, within the context of the legislation, to allow such an addition—if I may so call it—to actual development costs.<br><br>
On the other hand, I can see the force of the argument that here we have a disposal and a re-acquisition, but not an actual re-acquisition: it is merely one that is deemed by legislation. I am bound to say to the Committee that there are considerable difficulties in trying to meet this amendment. However, without any commitment—and I stress that—I am prepared to look again at this matter. I do not wish to raise any false development hopes, hope values, or anything else, but I shall consult the Inland Revenue to see if it is possible somehow to meet the points the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has raised. However, I do not hold out any great prospect of success, but as I have said, I will consider it again.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 457</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may continue with the analogy that the Minister made about not holding out any hope value, I thought that there was a considerable degree of betterment in his last answer than in the one he gave before. The Committee will clearly be grateful to him and, on the basis of the very qualified and acceptable assurance which he gave, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I urge the Minister to look again at the whole of Clause 6 to see whether it can be simplified? It seems to be pressing matters to extreme detail. Although I appreciate that we must have clauses in a Bill of this kind which seeks to impose a new tax, and which in certain circumstances go down to the detail, there must be occasions when, for the purpose of simplicity and easy administration, some better formulae can be produced than are now in Clause 6.<br><br>
When first reading the Bill, many Members must have put a large question mark against subsections (4) and (5), as I did, with a little note saying "What the hell does this mean?" It needs a great deal of time and time in tax matters means expense, both inside and outside the Inland Revenue. It takes time to understand the clauses and, when one has understood them, what do they mean? What is the purpose? Do they achieve anything?<br><br>
I have not much of a clue to what subsection (8) means. The admirable Explanatory Notes explain that subsection (8) provides that:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a project of material development relates to only part of the land in which an interest is held"</p></blockquote>
—here we have to chase after paragraph 10 of Schedule 1—that paragraph
<br><blockquote><p>"provides for market value to be determined on the occasion of a deemed disposal on the basis that the interest extends only to the part being developed. The base value is similarly restricted under paragraph 18 of Schedule 2."</p></blockquote>
We must then look up paragraph 18 of Schedule 2. The Explanatory Note continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of subsections (5) to (7) however the base A of the whole interest is used and not the base A as reduced under paragraph 18."</p></blockquote>
When we have finished going to and from the schedules to the clauses, we are told
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 458</span>
that paragraph 18 may be disregarded of Schedule 2 and it is not the base A as reduced under that paragraph. Once one has worked this out, it must apply in so few cases that I would not consider these complications to be necessary.<br><br>
There are some phrases in Clause 6 which might well be moved into the interpretation clause. We have mentioned this on several occasions. My plea on Clause 6 is to simplify it and not attempt to provide for every possible occasion, even though it is extremely remote that it will arise.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before taking up briefly one of the points raised by my right hon. Friend, may I say sincerely to the Government that I welcome the clause. It is undoubtedly a valuable and useful concession and I think it right that when the Opposition have been given such a concession—I do not mean that we have tabled amendments to achieve it, as the Government put it in the Bill in the beginning—it ought to be welcomed.<br><br>
For example, in my remarks in Committee on 6th April I gave a long example, which the Minister rightly said proved the point that I wanted to make. But even in my example, which appears in c. 367 of our proceedings, on the £200,000 market value and a purchase price of £5,000 per acre, the Clause 6 addition amounted to £30,000. That is a considerable sum and is to be welcomed.<br><br>
I now turn to the questions complication and subsequent explanation. For some time I have been reading the April 1975 publication of Capital Gains Tax "Development Gains from Land and First Letting Charge", which is the Revenue's booklet CGT 10, which attempts to explain development gains tax. Page 14 contains a description of the similar provisions on part disposals in development gains tax legislation to that which we have in Clause 6.<br><br>
Could the Minister say whether, when the Revenue publishes as it doubtless will, a similar booklet on development land tax to that which they published on capital gains tax, every step will be taken to make the explanation as simple as possible. For example, in paragraph 36 of the booklet on capital gains tax, the explanation of the similar provision is still difficult to understand. I hope that the Minister will think carefully about that, although I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0816">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 459</span>
appreciate that it is not easy to explain these complicated matters in simple terms.<br><br>
Finally, at one stage I asked the Government in a Parliamentary Question why there was no charge for this publication. The Minister said that it has always been the procedure for the Revenue to give away these publications free. However, I think that the people most likely to buy these publications are firms of accountants and solicitors on behalf of their clients. I think it would be reasonable for the Revenue to make a substantial charge for such helpful guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall tell my hon. Friend why. When I was at the Housebuilders' Federation giving explanations to my members, I thought it appropriate to make substantial charges for information of this sort which was over and above their subscription. Therefore, I see no reason why there should be no charge for information of this sort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is just another example of the way in which the State imposes enormous charges upon taxpayers by constantly changing the law and causing them to reconsider the law in order to determine their liability. The least that it can do if it is frequently messing people around to that extent is to provide free literature to help them through the maze.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not develop the point. But there is no such thing as free literature. Taxpayers pay for the literature. I thought that my hon. Friend was in favour of the reduction of public expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to deal with a few points raised on the "Clause Stand Part" debate. The right hon. Gentleman said that he did not understand—although I do not believe it—subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 6. The right hon. Gentleman probably meant that the language is extremely complex and it is difficult to follow all its ramifications. Subsections (4) and (5) are relieving subsections. Although we deny a special addition in relation to the deemed disposal reacquisition, except where there is a loss
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 460</span>
or a no gains situation, where a purchaser buys the land, or where there is an actual purchase of the land and an actual cost, subsections (4) and (5) ensure that the purchaser gets the special addition in relation to that situation. Therefore, although subsections (4) and (5) are complicated, they are relieving provisions. As the right hon. Gentleman has generously accepted, the clause in its entirety is a relieving provision.<br><br>
This shows the difficulty that it is not only when one is imposing taxation that it tends to become complicated but also when one is giving exemptions and reliefs. Sometimes this becomes even more complicated because one has to cover many different situations.<br><br>
With regard to subsection (8), whose meaning the hon. Gentleman asked about, his explanation from the explanatory booklet is better than I have in my brief. It related, as he said, to paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 which caused us a lot of difficulty, and no doubt we will come back to this when we come to Schedule 2, paragraph 18(1) and 18(2). These dealt with the rules on part disposals and the question of reducing the market value of value on land in order to undertake the computations. I assure the hon. Gentleman that subsection (8) relates to that situation.<br><br>
We were asked by the hon. Gentleman, with the best intentions, to make the explanations simple. Unfortunately, if one makes these complicated matters read simply, it tends to get misleading and irate taxpayers and special advisers will besiege the Inland Revenue saying "Why do you give bad and wrong advice?" In this complicated society we sometimes have to explain things in a more complicated way for the sake of accuracy, which is very important in taxation matters.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), questioned whether we should charge for these booklets, and I take the point that we have never charged for them in the past. I was surprised, as was his hon. Friend, that he is in favour of reducing the borrowing requirement. Here is an opportunity to put into practice what he has been preaching. As a good monetarist, I should have thought he would wish to charge for these
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0817">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 461</span>
things. But as so often with Opposition monetarists, when it comes to practice, they do not adhere to their principles as strictly as they should.<br><br>
This clause has been regarded as a generous help to developers. It is complicated and we shall look at it again to see whether it is possible to make it more simple. I should not have thought that it was possible, because of the variety of cases, to do much about simplification. I hope that the Committee will accept the clause as a help to the industry and that in that spirit it be allowed to stand part of the Bill.</span></p>

Friends have been praising so much, I find them of great help in this subsection. It says that this subsection defines the market value of an interest in land.<br><br>
I object to statutory definitions of market value—either it is market value or it is not market value and the valuer can decide that. A valuer can tell the Inland Revenue or the owner of land the market value of his land. After all, that is what the valuer is there for—namely, to know the market
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 462</span>
and what the land will fetch. In subsection (1) he is asked to give a fictitious market value.<br><br>
The clause starts off by saying
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of this Act, the market value at any time of an interest in land is the consideration which that interest might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale at that time in the open market…"</p></blockquote>
That is fair enough. It is exactly what a valuer would think is market value. I do not see that one needs to set it out in a statute in that form. We know the market value. It is confused by the latter part of subsection (1) by the statement
<br><blockquote><p>"but that consideration shall not be assumed to be reduced on the ground that the interest in all of the land in question is to be placed on the market at one and the same time."</p></blockquote>
Because the statute will say that it is not to be assumed to be reduced one has to assume that, in the absence of such a statutory provision, it would be reduced in value by all the land being put on the market at the same time. It may be the opposite. The land may be more valuable if it is all put on the market at the same time.<br><br>
However, here is a fictitious condition placed upon the valuer when he is asked to value the consideration which the property would fetch on the open market. I know that this is contained in other legislation. We saw it last year in Section 38 of the Finance Act 1975 in reference to capital transfer tax, which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"… the value at any time of any property shall for the purposes of capital transfer tax be the price which the property might reasonably be expected to fetch if sold in the open market at that time; but that price shall not be assumed to be reduced on the ground that the whole property is to be placed on the market at one and the same time."</p></blockquote>
I presume that the draftsman of the Development Land Tax Bill took his cue from the legislation relating to capital transfer tax and put this condition into Clause 7(1). It is, however, a condition telling the valuer not to value on the basis of fact, but to value on the basis of some fiction.<br><br>
Why should the market value be altered in this way when we are discussing for what consideration the property will be sold? When we consider what the gain is to the owner of the land or to the developer when he sells or leases the land or when he starts a project of material development on the land, is there really any reason why this assumption should be made? Are we not after the actual gain that the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0818">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 463</span>
landowner or developer is making? Is that not what is to be taxed? Why the fiction? To say that we have adopted the fiction in the capital transfer tax is no answer, because that is an altogether different form of taxation.<br><br>
We are not here considering the tax on the whole of the transfer of the property. We are considering the gain and discovering the amount of the gain on which the development land tax should fall.<br><br>
Amendment No. 81 seeks to remove subsection (1) and says, in effect, "Leave it to the valuer. Let him say what the market value is, because the valuer is the man who can really judge that figure".<br><br>
Alternatively, if it is desired to set out in the statute a definition of market value, one has that definition in the first three lines of subsection (1) as drafted. Therefore, Amendment No. 82 seeks to omit from "market" to the end of the subsection. It is a second best. I would rather not have "market value" statutorily defined at all, but if one is to define it, one should remove any assumptions which make it a fictitious valuation.<br><br>
If that does not appeal to the Treasury Bench, let us reduce the effect of the condition as much as possible by saying, as we do in Amendment No. 83, that it shall not apply
<br><blockquote><p>"unless the area of the land exceeds ten acres".</p></blockquote>
Although the amendment appears in my name and those of my hon. Friends, I am not enamoured of it. I want to remove this condition altogether—not merely to limit it and thereby complicate matters by limiting it to a certain area of land. I consider that there is an unnecessary condition to be assumed in the valuation for the purpose of the tax, which should not be imposed on the valuers.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for moving this important amendment. Frankly, I am more interested in Amendment No. 82 than in Amendment No. 81, because I want to get back to the wording of the original draft clauses in the White Paper. The White Paper in paragraph 7(1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Act, the market value at any time of an interest in land is the consideration that might reasonably be obtained on a sale of that interest at that time in the open market."</p></blockquote>
I suggest that the effect of Amendment No. 82 would be to revert to the wording
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 464</span>
in the White Paper, which I should consider reasonable. I prefer those words to the wording of Amendments Nos. 81 and 83. Although, like my right hon. Friend, my name is put to Amendment No. 83, I regard it as third best.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary will doubtless be aware that this matter has been exercising the minds of many people concerned with property, and I submit that the wording deteriorated during the period of consultations, between the publication of the White Paper and, subsequently, of the Bill. Surely what we want is to allow the district valuer, so far as possible, to operate within the realities of the market and not the artificialities that may exist at any time.<br><br>
I understand why the Inland Revenue has altered the clause from the words in the White Paper. Clearly it is concerned to get in a flooding provision. As my right hon. Friend said, there are many precedents. Indeed, I believe that the flooding provision goes back originally to estate duty legislation. I see the purposes for which it was inserted. Equally, I appreciate that there are precedents in determining market price to avoid an artificial glut.<br><br>
But we are not yet talking about, let us say, flooding the market with paintings or stocks and shares at a particular time. The position in respect of land is entirely different from that of paintings. I believe that when the French revolutionaries first tried to impose a wealth tax in 1789, soon after the revolution, they required aristocrats and others to sell all their paintings, in order to raise the wealth tax. The result was that the value of paintings fell like a stone, and the revolutionaries found themselves given sods of earth instead of money because no money could be raised from the scale of paintings. After that, the revolutionaries gave up the idea as a bad job and tried Madame Guillotine instead.<br><br>
The situation in respect of land is entirely different, because there is no such thing as a single market for land. There are enormous differences in local situations in land markets, and in the local assumptions which make for a difference in dealing with this commodity. I shall give an example. I shall not mention the company's name but I shall mention the area, because there is no reason why I should not do so.<br><br>
Some years ago the Northampton Development Corporation, in response to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0819">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 465</span>
reasonable pressure from several Governments and from its own members, decided to make a substantial release of land in the Northampton area. That was a proper and sensible move in order to get houses built. That move, however, had the effect of sharply devaluing the value of land held by house builders in that area, and many found that they had bought land much too expensively through that mass release of land.<br><br>
The builders were in the position of being able only to sell houses at a loss on the land which they had already bought. That is a classic example of where a change in the local situation made a big difference to the market. In that case, the words which are in the Bill would be unfair.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I imagine the Revenue takes the view—apart from saying that the flooding provision is well-precedented—that under the Bill a housebuilder can choose to regard a large estate as a single project if he so wishes. I can understand that suggestion, too. But having thought this matter over carefully as a builder, and having talked with other builders, I believe that the advantages in the Bill of choosing to maximise a project are, to say the least, doubtful. Even if the Revenue's view were to prevail, there would be no real advantage. The smaller projects would be valued on the normal market value basis and larger projects would be valued on the artifical and unreasonable basis in Clause 7(1) as now drafted, as opposed to Clause 7(1) as it was in the White Paper.<br><br>
Although there are precedents in previous legislation, I doubt whether the parallels are sufficiently exact to justify the method of valuation proposed in Clause 7(1) as drafted, in relation to land. We are, for the first time, dealing with the novel concept of deemed disposal. No previous land legislation, so far as I know, has contained this proposal. To cite estate duty or development gains tax as being precedents for the flooding provision is an argument I cannot accept. The entirely novel concept of a deemed disposal and to decide on the extent of that disposal—as the developer is being asked to do—but to be denied any benefit from the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 466</span>
ability to make that decision is a gift horse one can easily look in the mouth because it gives no benefit to the taxpayer.<br><br>
I imagine that the National House-builders Federation made points of this sort to the Revenue and, presumably, they will or already have had a reply. As a builder, I know that the industry is worried about it and people whose judgment I respect have said that they are concerned with the wording of this provision and would have far preferrred that of the White Paper—</span></p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S <i>attention having been called to the fact that seven Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seven Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the flood of interest in what I was saying, with hon. Members rushing in to hear my words of wisdom. Obviously the message has gone around the corridor that I was making a good speech. But I shall disappoint them because I am about to conclude by saying that, as the Government on several occasions have given useful assurances that they will look at these practical matters again, I hope they will do so in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) and the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) make my task that much easier. With their normal fairness, they put the arguments against the amendment as well as the arguments for them, leaving me with the much easier task of selecting those that I need to put if I am to persuade them that these amendments are not suitable for addition to the Bill.<br><br>
I take the point of the right hon. Member for Crosby that we are now discussing, in Clause 7, the definitions of market value and current use value in material development. Here we are deciding what is market value. The right hon. Gentleman objects to a statutory definition of market value and I understand that. It is one of those things that everybody knows but few are able to define with the precision that is necessary. That is the difference between the science which many people might claim for the subject
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0820">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 467</span>
and the art which we know it to be.<br><br>
I am sure that no one will know better than the right hon. Member for Crosby and the hon. Member for Melton that when one asks for a valuation one is almost inevitably at the same time asked for one's assumptions. The assumption one makes at the time—whether one is going to sell, the conditions one will attach, and so on, are an essential part of any valuation. One of the critical assumptions, if one is dealing with a particularly large development, is whether the whole of that land will be placed on the market at the same time. The right hon. Member for Crosby pointed out the fictitious nature of the second part of Clause 7(1), but he needs to understand that it would be fictitious if it were deleted.<br><br>
If it is left to the valuer, he will make even more assumptions when one is talking not of an actual disposal but of value in itself. If one is talking of an actual disposal, one can visualise a situation in which land comes on to the market at a certain time of the year, when the vendor knows full well the interest of certain individuals and groups of individuals and how they will react to the opportunity to buy the interest concerned. It is much more difficult—and it stretches the art of the valuer much further—if one is not talking about customers here and now but of the valuation itself as an entity in itself. That is something we have to provide for in this legislation. As the hon. Member for Melton pointed out, it is provided for elsewhere in estate duty. In making an assumption of this kind one of the critical assumptions will be whether one puts it on the market in manageable lots, so that the market can absorb it in an orderly way, or whether to flood the market and so depress it in a disorderly way. These are the most general principles one can bring into operation in the sale of property.<br><br>
There are also the practical problems. We have the possibility of a developer bringing about a large-scale development, making use of the argument that it will depress the market, when his normal method of operation would not be to act in that way. He would be obtaining an</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 468</span>
<p>advantage which I do not think either side of the Committee would wish him to receive.</p>
<p>Amendment No. 83 seems to have very few friends among the Opposition, and none on the Government side. Although it deals with the problem of flooding the market in those areas where that might most easily be accepted as a possibility, it assumes that land will be placed on the market in one large quantity, a possibility which will never come about. It has the further disadvantage that it could encourage the provision of very large projects to allow for the flooding provision to obtain a lower rate of development land tax.</p>
<p>We have made the most realistic provision that can be made. I am always pleased to hear of an alternative wording but it must be wording based upon the same principles establishing the value between the willing buyer and the willing seller. I accept that these are not easy conditions to determine, but it is the only way by which one can calculate a value for the interest of the person concerned, as well as for the interest of the development land tax. It is because of those factors that I am unable to accept the amendments.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary said that in any valuation one is always asked to assume certain things. The only assumption which should be made in this case is that put in the first part of this clause, that it is an open market. That is the only assumption needed in order to get to the market value. To put any other assumption on it is, as I said at the outset, entirely fictitious.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary has explained fully the Government's reasons for having this condition included, and I am grateful to him. I do not think there is any point in my labouring this argument. We are at issue on this matter, and we must record our dislike of the Government's principles adopted in subsection (1) and divide in favour of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 8.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0821">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 469</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 100, in page 9, line 23, after 'Schedule' insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'or of a kind specified in Part II of Schedule 4 to this Act'.</p></blockquote>
In the previous amendment we were discussing the statutory definition of "market value". We come in subsection (2) to a statutory definition of
<br><blockquote><p>"the current use value of an interest in land"</p></blockquote>
and again we are directed to assume certain matters. We are told that the current use value must be calculated on the assumption that—and then there are two paragraphs of assumptions that are to be made.<br><br>
In paragraph (<i>a</i>) the first assumption is that:
<br><blockquote><p>"… planning permission would be granted for any development of the land which is development of a class specified in the relevant planning Schedule;"</p></blockquote>
That is defined later, in Clause 7(3), as what we commonly know as the Schedule 8 tolerance.<br><br>
This amendment seeks to introduce a further assumption in making a valuation of the current use value and to add to paragraph (<i>a</i>) the assumption that
<br><blockquote><p>"planning permission would be granted for any development of the land which is development of a class specified in the relevant planning Schedule; or of a kind specified in Part II of Schedule 4 to this Act".</p></blockquote>
Therefore, I would ask the Committee to turn to Schedule 4, Part II which sets out a fairly substantial list of development that is excluded from material development.<br><br>
This is of the same nature as
<br><blockquote><p>"development of a class specified in the relevant planning Schedule".</p></blockquote>
It is, as it were, a concession to planning permission; it is a matter on which which planning permission is deemed to be unnecessary to some extent. Therefore, it seems reasonable, in assessing the current use value, to assume—if we are to make any assumptions—that development for those purposes as are set out in Part II of Schedule 4 would be granted permission.<br><br>
I do not think I need go through each item of paragraph 5 of Part II of Schedule 4, which lists these items of development, because we shall come to them later in our consideration of the Bill; but they are matters that are excluded from the idea of material development, and therefore it seems perfectly reasonably that we assume, in assessing current use value, that they should be matters for which permission would be granted.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 470</span>
I mentioned only paragraph 5 of Part II of the Schedule, but, of course, if the amendment were accepted, it would introduce the whole of Part II, which deals with all those matters that are not assumed to be material development.<br><br>
I do not think I need labour the point. It seems a reasonable assumption to make when assessing current use value, and I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p>12 noon.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are dealing here with the definition of "current use value". This includes the value of the right to carry out the development, as the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) pointed out, under Schedule 8 to the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. That covers minor rebuilding, extensions, and so on. It also includes the value of any project of material development that was begun before the relevant date, and it is only right that it should. It also includes any development that is not material development—and we shall come to the definitions for that in Part II of Schedule 4, particularly in paragraph 6.<br><br>
"Material development" does not include development for which planning permission is given under a current general development order; nor does it include development covered by Part II of Schedule 4, and this excepts from material development a wide range of building operations—things like advertising hoardings and agricultural buildings.<br><br>
This amendment proposes that the development falling within Part II of Schedule 4 should have planning permission in the same way as under any general development order. If this amendment were to be included in the Bill, the value would come into current use value. The danger is that a great deal of this development value would then become part of current use value and there would be a problem in regard to development land tax. But there would also be disputes over valuations of land fronting a road or railway, which might always be said to have had advertising value, even though everybody knows full well that planning permission would never be given for a development of this kind.<br><br>
Clause 7, subsection (2) avoids this
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0822">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 471</span>
danger. The current use value definition that we have adopted incorporates the value of the development which the market would expect the planning authority to allow. Surely the proper definition to be followed is what in practice would be allowed. I believe that the definition disposes of this matter quite happily. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would wish to see all our legislation as precise and as clear as this. I hope, therefore, that the amendment will not be pressed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This matter surely is precise and clear when set out in the schedule. Are the items excluded from material development? What the Financial Secretary is saying is that his Part II of Schedule 4, is not clear. Indeed, of course, there can be argument over whether there could be an advertising site. If he is worried about that, perhaps he would exclude Schedule 4, paragraph 5(1) (<i>d</i>), if that is the sole reason why he is refusing the amendment. But we have in the Bill a definition of "material development" and indeed several definitions of material development which are extremely confusing. If the definition of "material development", for the purpose of the projects of material development, is to be defined as in Schedule 4—that is to say, that certain developments are entirely excluded from that phrase—it is reasonable that we should exclude them in considering the current use value.<br><br>
The object of the amendments relating to current use value seeks to include as much in that value as possible. To that extent, I put forward the case of the taxpayer, but it is a fair case and a reasonable case.<br><br>
In the case of the material development which will form a project under this Bill and start off a deemed disposal, surely we should carry that definition through into the values which one has to assess on that kind of disposal. It is not only paragraph 5 of Schedule 4 which lists out the developments excluded from material development, but there are the other paragraphs of Schedule 4, such as paragraph 6, which deal with matters of escape in case of fire, car parking or garage space, and so on. In paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 we set out the various use classes. When there is a change of use within a class, it is not material development.<br><br>
We are faced with the reidiculous propo-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 472</span>
sition that under the Act for one purpose "material development" means one thing and for another purpose it means something else. Yet when it means something else it is used for exactly the same purpose as the first in order to discover the difference between the current use value on the date of disposal and at the date of reacquisition.<br><br>
I still think that this is an amendment which would bring fairness in the assessment of the amount on which the development land tax is to be paid. That amount is the realised value, whether it is a real realisation or a deemed realisation, and the Revenue should be prepared to treat the person chargeable to the tax in a reasonable way in assessing the current use value.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I fully agree with the last comments of the right hon. Gentleman to charge those people liable to the tax in the most reasonable way possible. I entirely accept his point. But there is a difference of view as to the word "reasonable".<br><br>
Perhaps I should say more about the problem of possible seepage of development value into current use value. I accept the point made by the right hon. Gentleman on the car parking site. We shall come to that in a later amendment and can pursue our discussions then.<br><br>
The main problem that still remains is that under the amendment development which falls within these provisions shall be taken to have planning permission. The value of this would then come into current use value. There would then be a situation where current use value would incorporate the value of the development which the market would not expect the planning authority to allow. If the planning authority will not permit development of a kind, not even remotely permit it, why then should it be allowed? That is the problem facing us and the reason why the Government cannot accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I press the Financial Secretary again on that point? If such a development would not be expected to be allowed, it would not be valued as being allowed. In the amendment we say that this can be taken into account. If there is no value in the development, that would not alter the valuation of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0823">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 473</span>
current use value.<br><br>
I fear that when we operate the Act with the different definitions of "material development"—for one purpose it means one thing and for another purpose it means another—it will give rise to the most difficult situation in valuations under the application of the Act.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary said that problems will arise if the amendment is accepted. I am certain that worse problems will arise if we reject the amendment. I hope for some better response from the hon. Gentleman than that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the right hon. Gentleman's point. I think that the argument I used is the most important, but I will give him a further argument which the right hon. Gentleman might view more sympathetically. That argument concerns the nature of disputes that would arise where planning permission might have been a possibility at some stage and could affect the valuation. That is a matter which could lead to lengthy negotiations and discussions on the valuation concerned. We think that we can get rid of this at the outset by saying that only if the planning authority would not allow it, it ought not to be considered. I think that this would be a not unreasonable view.</span></p>
<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 101, in page 9, line 23, after 'Schedule', insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(<i>b</i>) that notice would be given under paragraph 4 of the 7th Schedule to the Community Land Land Act 1975 by all of the authorities in the area in which the land is situated stating that they do not intend to acquire the land'.</p></blockquote>
With this amendment we have to take into account a matter that has perhaps been overlooked, by the draftsmen of the Bill, because it came into operation only recently. I am referring to the Community Land Act of last year and the notices that may be given under that Act.<br><br>
If I may put the amendment in its right place in the Bill, we are dealing again with the current use value and the assumptions which we are told we must make in finding what is current use value. As was said in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 474</span>
the discussion on the previous amendment, one of the assumptions is that
<br><blockquote><p>"planning permission would be granted for any development of the land which is development of a class specified in the relevant planning Schedule".</p></blockquote>
Here with the amendment we would add that we should also make the assumption
<br><blockquote><p>"that notice would be given under paragraph 4 of Schedule 7 to the Community Land Act 1975 by all of the authorities in the area in which the land is situated stating that they do not intend to acquire the land."</p></blockquote>
If one does not make that assumption, then in finding current use value it could be assumed that the Community Land Act would be in operation, and that the local authorities concerned would be intending to acquire the property, so the current use value would be considerably reduced.<br><br>
Let me put on record to the Committee—although I am sure the Minister knows it by heart—paragraph 4 of Schedule 7 to the Community Land Act 1975. It is the paragraph which deals with notices by authorities, and is headed "Planning Permission to which Section 19 of the Act Applies", so perhaps I should refer first to Section 19. This brings back nostalgic memories of the Committee stage of the Community Land Bill.<br><br>
Section 19 deals with planning permission for relevant development and applications for the first appointed day. It gives the right to certain elections, and so on, in relation to planning permission for relative development, and Schedule 7(4)(1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"It shall be the duty of each of the authorities to serve on the person making an election under Section 19 of this Act a notice stating that the authority intend, or do not intend, to acquire the land to which the planning permission relates."</p></blockquote>
It will make a great difference to the current use value of the land as to whether a notice says that the authority does intend, or does not intend to acquire. Therefore, this is one of the cases in which we really make some assumption in arriving at the current use value, and the amendment says that we make the assumption that notice would be given under paragraph 4 of Schedule 7 by all of the authorities in the area in which the land is situated—because, of course, a district or county authority can give that notice; it depends perhaps upon the land acquisition and management scheme as to which authority is going to give the notice—stating that they do not intend to acquire the land.<br><br>
It is only fair that the person chargeable
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0824">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 475</span>
with this tax should be allowed to put the highest reasonable current use value on that land when the amount on which the tax is to be charged is assessed. It is reasonable to say to the valuer when valuing the current use value "You assume that the property will not be acquired by a local authority and that the value will not therefore be reduced by having only that limited market in which the land could be sold at its current use value".<br><br>
If one has a limited market in that way and only one purchaser is concerned—namely the authorities, because only one purchaser would be concerned if one assumes that they have said that they intend to purchase—the value is reduced. If one looks at the current use value from the point of view of the market value at current use, not the market value that we have been talking about previously with more than one purchaser the value is enhanced.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will be able to say that we are quite right to introduce this here since the matter was overlooked. The Community Land Bill was passed with encumbrances which oppressed the property. When the White Paper in the blue book on which the Bill was based was published in August 1975, the Community Land Bill had not received the Royal Assent; it received Royal Assent on 12th November 1975. It is reasonable that the Bill would not have taken into account, if it were drafted on the basis of the White Paper, the Community Land Act.<br><br>
I hope that I have put the case sufficiently clearly to persuade the Minister that the amendment should be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has said that the reason for his amendment is that he is concerned that the workings of the Community Land Act—particularly the possibility of notices—will depress the current use value of the land. If that situation were to arise, the current use value being much lower there would be a greater charge to development land tax than would otherwise be the case.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman put a number of arguments. He seemed to indicate that, because of the existence of the Community Land Act, as we were moving towards second appointed day there would be fewer and fewer purchasers and that it might be difficult to reach a figure of market value with only one major pur-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 476</span>
chaser.<br><br>
Perhaps I can set the right hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. I do not accept that this will happen—for two reasons. First, compensation under the Community Land Act would be payable at full market value. There is no question that compensation would be payable at any other value than full market value.<br><br>
Section 9 of the Land Compensation Act 1961 makes clear that any depreciation of value in relation to the value of land caused by a proposed scheme of acquisition is to be ignored. Therefore, if we apply Section 9, and if there is an intention to acquire land by the local authority, that kind of acquisition is to be ignored if it causes a depreciation of value.<br><br>
There are two factors to be taken into account. First, the fact that compensation is paid at market value and, secondly, that Section 9 provides a safeguard if there is a depreciation in current use value because of local authority acquisition, whether under the Community Land Act 1975 or any other parallel Act, and that depreciation is not to be taken into account in arriving at the current use value.<br><br>
There is a further point upon which the right hon. Gentleman may not have touched fully. I intend to make use of my brief because there may be some misunderstanding in relation to elections under Section 19 of the Community Land Act 1975 where permission has become suspended. I understand that any pre-suspension developments will not be excluded from current use value. Clause 7 will not have this kind of effect. Apparently, subsection (2) (<i>b</i>)(<i>ii</i>) ensures that account is taken of any project of material development already commenced. That is a special point not mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman in his speech. If there are any fears regarding pre-suspension development, these fears are groundless and current use value will not be affected.<br><br>
I hope that with those assurances the right hon. Gentleman can accept that the danger which he foresees in his amendment will not arise. Compensation will be at market value and, perhaps more important, as a result of the operation of Section 9 of the Land Compensation Act 1961.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. I hesitate to give a contrary view
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0825">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 477</span>
because he has introduced Section 9 of the Land Compensation Act 1961 and I have not before me the relevant section of that Act. I am merely giving my recollection of the effect of that section when I say that I have always understood that this meant that one disregarded the use of the property as a result of a proposal for compulsory acquisition.<br><br>
For example, if the property were to be acquired for a playing field, one did not disregard the fact that its current use value as a cornfield, or whatever it might be, would produce far more income to the owner than if it were given as a playing field. But that does not take into account the fact that it is to be compulsorily acquired. I acknowledge the fact that one disregards the eventual use of it. But, as I understand the valuation of current use value, it includes a hope value, not a certainty that planning permission will be given for anything in particular or that there is any other use than the existing use which, as a matter of certainty, will be allowed.<br><br>
I understood that the difference between current use value and the sort of value at which, for example, new towns can acquire property was the difference between that hope value—namely, that when one was valuing for current use purposes or trying to get to a current use value, one still took into account the hope value in relation to the land not the value of any specific planning permission.<br><br>
If that is so, the hope value is entirely removed by a notice from the local authority that it intends to acquire that property. That is the sort of notice which might be given under Section 19 of the Community Land Act 1975 and under Part II of Schedule 7 of that Act. One ought not to assume that such a notice would be given. Unless we mention this fact in the Bill, what is the assumption to be made? Is the valuer to assume that a notice will be given, has been given, may be given, or will never be given? As far as I can see, there are those four assumptions that might be made.<br><br>
It is not true to say that, because compensation is given for current use value, that means that to whomsoever the property is sold will pay the same figure as a local authority which has put itself in the position of being a monopoly in respect of that land. If we do not mention
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 478</span>
in the Bill any provisions of the Community Land Act, the valuers will be left in doubt as to what value they are to assume in assessing current use value. As we get nearer and nearer, for example, the second appointed day under the Community Land Act when the local authority can acquire the property at current use value, the valuer will be in great difficulty in valuing properly under the Bill.<br><br>
I appreciated the fact that the Minister put on the record the position of development before a planning permission had been suspended under Section 19 of the Community Land Act. It is a valuable point to have on the record, but it certainly does not settle the matter of this amendment. I hope that the Minister will say that he will look at the matter again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to tangle with the right hon. Gentleman on planning law. Being a rash young man, I may occasionally tangle with him on fiscal matters. I am told, however, that Section 9 has the effect that I indicated. Possibly, the right hon. Gentleman had in mind other provisions of the Land Compensation Act which also relate to schemes. My understanding is that Section 9 provides what I said to the Committee it would, and will provide the necessary safeguard. We will look at this matter again to make sure that this is correct, that Section 9 provides the safeguard, and that there will not be the danger which he has indicated. My advice is that Section 9 does provide that the right hon. Gentleman said that current use value includes some hope value, but I do not think that that legislation includes hope value and I beg to differ with him on that point.<br><br>
On the general point regarding the fact that as we move to the second appointed day the local authority is the only purchaser in the field, this might lead to difficulties with valuation. We have seen situations like this before where, for certain assumptions—certainly in fiscal law—one ignores the fact there is only one purchaser or a special purchaser. This applies to shares in unquoted companies, where there may be only one or two purchasers on the scene because of various restrictions on those shares. The valuation of those shares has to take account—I accept there have been difficulties—of those restrictions.<br><br>
If account is not taken of these restrictions, the valuation has to be on the basis
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0826">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 479</span>
that there will be more than one purchaser in the field. These matters are not completely unknown to valuers; they have to make these assumptions and I do not accept that there will be a very big problem as we have toward the second appointed day.<br><br>
We believe that Section 9 covers the situation with which he is concerned. However, I will look into Section 9 again to ensure that this is the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will look at the matter again. It is not an easy matter. It is complicated. On that assurance, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 95, in page 10, line 26, after 'force' insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'or which would be so granted but for a direction given under the order or a condition imposed in any planning permission granted or deemed to be granted otherwise than by such an order'.</p></blockquote>
Here again, we are dealing with assumptions in making the valuation of current use value. We seek to insert words into the definition of "material development". This is yet another definition of "material development". If we have an interpretation clause and move all these definitions into it, when we come to "material development" we shall have a definition which says "material development means one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or 10", because there will possibly be 10 definitions of it throughout the Bill. However, subsection (7) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of this Act 'material development' means any development other than"</p></blockquote>
and that is followed by paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).<br><br>
In paragraph (<i>a</i>) "material development" is other than
<br><blockquote><p>"development for which planning permission is granted by a general development order for the time being in force".</p></blockquote>
After the word "force" the amendment seeks to insert the words
<br><blockquote><p>"or which would be so granted but for a direction given under the order or a condition imposed in any planning permission granted or deemed to be granted otherwise than by such an order".</p></blockquote>
This is almost a drafting amendment. The intention is to show that "material development" is something other than that which would be allowed by a general development order. However, there are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 480</span>
certain exceptional cases under the general development order, or cases which are dealt with by means of exception to the general development order, which I have tried to include in rather wide words in the amendment. I should have thought, without going into any examples, that the definition of "material development" in subsection (7) should have contained such a phrase as this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said that this was, in effect, a drafting amendment. I am happy to accept the principle of the amendment. I am grateful to him for drawing the Committee's attention to this matter. We have consulted the draftsman, and he wants to put in a few "hereofs" here and there and to recast the drafting to some extent.<br><br>
I am in your hands, Mr. Fitch, and that of the Committee, but I have an amendment which, for technical reasons, we were unable to table. I do not suggest that we should present this to the Committee now. However, if you are prepared to accept it as a typed manuscript amendment, Mr. Fitch, and if the right hon. Gentleman is happy—he has not had notice of it, but the draftsman has met the points he made—I should be happy to put the amendment in.<br><br>
I recognise that this may not be a conventional way of dealing with the matter. If this is not acceptable to you, Mr. Fitch, and the Committee, we shall bring forward the amendment on Report. However, the main point I want to make is that we accept the right hon. Gentleman's points. I prefer our amendment to his, but I am happy with the principle of his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without even seeing the amendment, Mr. Fitch, I ask you to accept this course, even though it is unusual. I trust the Minister. He said that he accepted the principle. I am sure that he has been correctly advised on this. It is a procedure which saves a lot of time on Report, if we have to dispute it again then.<br><br>
I shall talk for a few moments, Mr. Fitch, while you get advice as to whether it is in order.<br><br>
I am always a gambler in these matters. I am prepared to bet that it is acceptable, as the Minister has said that he accepts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0827">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 481</span>
the principle. In these circumstances, I hope that we can reach finality. If you, Mr. Fitch, will allow the amendment to be moved as a manuscript amendment, I hope that it will be accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: First, I ask the right hon. Gentleman to withdraw his amendment, if he is willing to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There appear to be three Government manuscript amendments, which I should like the Minister to read out.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as a manuscript amendment, in page 10, line 24, after "permission" to insert "(i)".<br><br>
With this, Mr. Fitch, there are two connected amendments, which it will be convenient to dispose of at the same time—<br><br>
In page 10, line 26, after "force" insert "or
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>ii</i>) would be so granted but for a direction given under the order or a condition imposed in any planning permission granted or deemed to be granted otherwise than by such an order".</p></blockquote>
In page 10, line 28, after "is" insert "or would be".<br><br>
These are the three amendments, the first and the last being consequential on the middle one, which is the substantive amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's amendment is in almost the same words as Amendment No. 95 on the Amendment Paper. It merely arranges that amendment into a subsection. It is a very convenient way of doing it. I support the Minister's amendments.<br><br>
<i>Manuscript Amendments made.</i><br><br>
In page 10, line 26, after "force" insert "or
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>ii</i>) would be so granted but for a direction given under the order or a condition imposed in any planning permission granted or deemed to be granted otherwise than by such an order'.</p></blockquote>
In page 10, line 28, after "is" insert" or
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 482</span>
would be".—[<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</span></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a fairly thorough discussion on Clause 7. It is a clause which will be very important in the administration of the Bill. I am grateful to the Minister for the amendment which he has put forward to subsection (7). It clears up the matter very well.<br><br>
The subsections which have not come into our discussion on the amendments are subsections (4) and (5). We are told in the Explanatory Notes that subsection (4)
<br><blockquote><p>"Contains a special rule for arriving at current use value where the receipt of compensation etc. is treated as a part disposal."</p></blockquote>
In amendments to earlier clauses we dealt with the payment of compensation and how it is treated as disposal. The Explanatory Notes tell us further:
<br><blockquote><p>"The current use value of the interest in respect of which the compensation is paid is the value which would have applied if the circumstances causing the compensation to be received has not arisen"—</p></blockquote>
that is,
<br><blockquote><p>"the undamaged current use value".</p></blockquote>
That is wonderful. We have one more phrase—the UCUV. It sounds like a university college of something or other. But it means the "undamaged current use value".<br><br>
May I test the matter to see whether I understand that? I take it that if, for example, compensation is paid under the Land Compensation Act for some injury to land by the building of a motorway, and so on, we must assume, when assessing the current use value, that the motorway was not there. I am not sure that I am right in thinking that, because that would produce some extraordinary situations.<br><br>
I come to Clause 7(5). We are told in the Explanatory Notes that
<br><blockquote><p>"The market and current use values of an interest in land are determined as if the land were free from any security (e.g. a mortgage) which may be charged upon it."</p></blockquote>
I agree that that is right, but it may raise problems about the other interests in land which are not unlike a mortgage. Is this intended to apply to all forms of security over land, such as equitable mortgate or any form of borrowing on the security of land? Clause 7(5) says
<br><blockquote><p>"by way of security in or over the land".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0828">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 483</span>
Although the Explanatory Notes say "(eg a mortgage)", I take it that the somewhat wide wording in the clause itself covers almost any form of security taken over the land.<br><br>
Those were the two subsections which have not come into our discussions. Although subsection (6) has not come into the discussions on amendments, I absolutely boggle at the prospect of trying to consider our dear old friend the UXB, which goes back to the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. We dealt with it in the 1950s and again in the 1960s, and we find it rearing its ugly head again today. My hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) talked about worms and quoted Richard II,
<br><blockquote><p>"Let's talk of graves, and worms, and epitaphs"</p></blockquote>
I had hoped that this UXB was buried beneath the earth for ever, yet it has come up again now.<br><br>
However, I do not believe that it will apply to many cases, so I shall not even ask the Minister to try to explain that subsection. We shall leave it to those who recollect the debates on the 1947 Act, the 1952 Act, and later Acts on town and country planning.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to say something about subsections (4) and (5), so that we have his remarks on the record. That may enable those who have to administer the clause to understand what it is about.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I was not able to be present for the debates on the amendments to the clause, I hope that it will not be considered improper for me to add a few words to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend referred to the impact of subsection (4), and I, too, am concerned about this. Will the Minister tell us how this provision will work in practice? It is not easy to comprehend, reading the text of the Bill, even taken in conjunction with the Explanatory Notes, exactly what will be the effect from the viewpoint of tax liability when compensation is paid. I am not clear, for example, how the provision would apply when the compensation may be different, perhaps clearly different, from the change in value of the property for which that compensation is paid. Compensation is by
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 484</span>
no means always fairly replaced. The change in value, arising as a result of the event which gave rise to the compensation—and therefore the detriment to the undamaged current use value—may be different from the amount actually received.<br><br>
I think it would be helpful, as my right hon. Friend said, to put something on the record about this clause, and this subsection in particular, explaining how these matters are designed to turn out in practice, and what the advantages or disadvantages may be to potential taxpayers facing such a situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with those three points and subsections (4) and (5) and perhaps less fully with subsection (6).<br><br>
Subsection (4) is intended to prevent the current use value from being wrongfully depressed. Thus, the provision is to the benefit of the taxpayer in case current use value were otherwise reduced as a result of depreciation. In the example of the motorway, I understand that it would be assumed to have damaged development value but not current use value. Following from that, I would divine that its current use value would be higher, as the motorway would not be taken to have damaged or depressed the value of current use, which would be of benefit to the taxpayer because the higher its current use value the less tax he will pay at the end of the day.<br><br>
I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for making it clear that the provision of subsection (5), which on the face of it—excluding a mortgage of a security from computation—might seem unreasonable in fact has to be there, and is in other legislation. I can confirm that it does not include merely a mortgage. Other interests secured on land will also be taken into account. It is not confined to mortgage, and legislation does not specifically mention a mortgage.<br><br>
As for subsection (6), I am grateful that the right hon. Gentleman did not ask me to explain what the
<br><blockquote><p>"unexpended balance of established development value"</p></blockquote>
is. I will read my brief if the hon. Gentleman likes, but I cannot explain it. The right hon. Gentleman wants it on the record, so here it is.<br><br>
Subsection (6) ensures that any
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0829">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 485</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"unexpended balance of established development value"</p></blockquote>
is reflected in current use value on a sale to an authority possessing compulsory powers of acquisition. There are references to Section 142 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, and another piece of legislation. That provides that on such a sale that "unexpended balance" is regarded as extinguished immediately before the sale takes place, and so there is a danger that the value of the "unexpended balance" would not be reflected in current use value. This subsection treats the "unexpended balance" as remaining in existence for the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 486</span>
purpose of determining current use value. I am sure that that makes it crystal-clear to the right hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will now see fit to allow the clause to stand part of the Bill.</span></p>
