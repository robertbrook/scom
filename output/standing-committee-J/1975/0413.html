	<section>
	<div class='title'>REALISED DEVELOPMENT VALUE: SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 65, in page 79, line 17, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or if the chargeable person elects to produce evidence of the same the market value of the material interest at the time of that person's acquisition of the same'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 67, in page 80, line 18, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>or if the chargeable person elects to produce evidence of the market value of the material interest at the time of that person's acquisition of the same'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As so often in the Bill, we are having a slight case of cart before horses, because we are referring back, or forward, to Clause 10 when we look at this schedule. I am sure there are good reasons why we are considering Schedule 2 before Clause 10, but we are considering here an amendment to add to Schedule 2(3)(2) which starts:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If the chargeable person acquired a part of the relevant interest in such circumstances that, if that part continued to exist as a separate entity section l0 of this Act would apply."</p></blockquote>
Clause 10 includes the suggestion that, if somebody acquires land by a gift and disposes of it, or a charge arises in connection with the Bill, the cost shall be taken to be the cost that would apply as far as the donor is concerned. This seems to be a very strange idea. As I understand it, transfer of land as a gift would acquire capital transfer tax on its actual value and not on the historic cost to the donor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>538</span>
We seem to be in the curious situation of its being suggested that under one tax a transfer of land shall be taken to be a transfer of land at its then market value, and under this tax that transfer shall be taken to have been a transfer of land at its historic cost. That seems particularly unfair to the taxpayer and is definitely a case of "Heads you lose, tails I win" in his relationship with the Treasury. I do not want the Minister to think that I am always criticising the Treasury, but in considering this Bill one is inevitably suggesting that some things are unfair to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have put forward the amendment to try to correct what seems to be a major anomaly, and I hope that the Minister will be able to persuade us either that the situation is not as it appears to be or, if he does not accept our choice of words, that he can find a better way of correcting the anomaly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can enlighten the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) in relation to Clause 10 before coming to the amendment, because the provisions of Schedule 2 are related to and influenced by the regime set up in Clause 10 in relation to gifts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear at the outset that Clause 10 does not adversely affect the taxpayer in any way. In fact, Clause 10 provides that for the purposes of development land tax there will be no charge at the point of a gift. Where land is given by a person making a gift of land and that land has development value, for the purpose of development land tax there is no charge at that point and the charge arises only when the donee disposes of the land for a consideration. The doner's cost of acquisition is then taken to be the donor's cost of acquisition, and all the tax falls on the actual disposal for a consideration by the donee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole object of Clause 10 is to avoid a situation where there would be a charge to development land tax on a gift. Most hon. Members will agree that it would be undesirable to impose a charge to development land tax on a gift. The hon. Gentleman is right when he says that capital transfer tax applies in relation to a gift and we deem the disposal to be at market value, but capital transfer tax is a different tax. It is meant to impose liability on gifts when a person transfers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0860">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>539</span>
the value of his estate for no consideration. That is why there is a charge for capital transfer tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But as regards development land tax, the Bill deliberately and intentionally excludes any charge on a gift, so the charge applies only when there is a disposal, which I think is the logical and right way to deal with the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come later to Schedule 6. This is a complicated schedule dealing with the interaction of other taxes and there will, no doubt, be questions relating to credit in relation to capital transfer tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 10 is designed to help to prevent a situation where there will be a charge on a gift, unlike the present position—I am not making a party political point—under the development gains charge, which imports all the rules of the capital gains tax legislation. One effect of importing all the rules of capital gains tax legislation, under which there is a charge on gifts, was to charge the present development gains charge on gifts of land for no consideration. Therefore, as the law stands at present, when land with development value is given under the development gains charge régime there is a charge, in fact, although there is no disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have deliberately tried to avoid that situation in relation to development land tax and to provide that there will be no charge when land is transferred for no consideration. We shall see later what happens where there is part consideration, but where land is transferred for no consideration it is intended that there should be no charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to paragraph 3 of Schedule 2. This deals with assembled land—that is, parts of land which may be acquired at different times; and, when it is disposed of, it is important that the cost of acquisition in relation to different parts should be amalgamated into the total base value. Again, it is meant to work in the main in favour of the taxpayer, so that he does not lose the base values on any particular cost of acquisition. The whole cost of acquisition is added up in relation to different parts of the land into one assembled part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to refer to Clause 10 to ensure that, w hen the person who disposes of the assembled part is disposing of some land which was given to him for no consideration, in arriving at his tax
	<span class='label label-info column'>540</span>
on the disposal of the assembled part he gets the original cost of acquisition to the donor as a cost of acquisition for the purpose of disposing of the land. In other words, without paragraph 3 he would lose the cost of acquisition to the donor in respect of any part of the assembled land which had been given to him for no consideration at all. The object is to include the cost of acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision is complicated, but I hope I have made it clear. The object is to enable the person disposing of the land, who had acquired it for no consideration, to get the benefit of the donor's cost of acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the reason for tabling these amendments and make no criticism, but, if we were to accept them, that cost of acquisition would not be the donor's cost of acquisition. It would be the market value, as I understand it, of the land at the time of the acquisition. In other words, the amendments would import the notion of a disposal of market value in relation to a gift, whereas, under the legislation, as I have tried to explain, we prefer to do it on the basis of no disposal on a gift and to take the original cost of acquisition as the cost of acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that is better. As the amendment stands, of course, there would probably be no charge on the gift, despite the fact that the gift was deemed to be made at market value. I make no comment on that, because I do not think that it is important. We are concerned with ensuring through Clause 10 that there will not be a charge on a gift. The charge arises on disposal. The cost of acquisition to the donor is taken into account in assessing the final disposal both in respect of an ordinary disposal and in the case of a disposal of assembled land. Paragraph 3 ensures that the taxpayer gets the benefit of that cost of acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that makes it reasonably clear to the Committee. If there are any other points, I will certainly deal with them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for the explanation and reason behind it. However, it leaves in my mind one disturbing aspect which, perhaps, we shall discuss when we get to Schedule 6. Before we part with this amendment, however, will the Minister enlighten us as to the effect of the interaction to which he referred between capital transfer tax
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0861">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>541</span>
and development land tax? As I understand it, he is saying that on the occasion of the gift it would be inappropriate to have a development land tax charge. But there will be a capital transfer tax charge. The capital transfer tax will be levied on the market value including the development land tax which is to be paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely this means that in fact the donee is paying tax on something which he has not got. All he has in fact acquired is a liability to pay tax in due course. Is not this an anomalous situation which could be corrected by having a charge to development land tax, if appropriate, at the time of the gift?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not go into the full details of the interaction provisions of Schedule 6. I think that it is better not to, because I may say something which is not strictly accurate and that would cause more difficulties, especially to people outside the House who have to read our reports. It is better that we should deal with the matter specifically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I refer the hon. Gentleman to Part III of Schedule 6, which is headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Liability for Capital Transfer Tax or Estate Duty Precedes Charge to Development Land Tax."</p></blockquote>
Part III of Schedule 6 deals generally with the situation where there is a prior charge to capital transfer tax and then there is a later charge to development land tax. However, I would prefer not to go into that matter in detail. It would be very unwise of me to do so, because Schedule 6 is extremely complicated. Perhaps we could come back to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the amendments in relation to this paragraph the intention is to benefit the taxpayer. The intention is not to have a charge on gifts. When we reach Clause 10 and discuss the matter further, I think the hon. Gentleman will see it is preferable that there should not be a development land tax charge on gifts, because they are made for no consideration. To import an idea of a development land charge is slightly artificial. The idea is not artificial in relation to capital transfer tax, because that is what it is meant to charge. It may be slightly artificial in relation to the capital gains tax, but I do not want to go into that argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be happy with that explanation. Certainly
	<span class='label label-info column'>542</span>
we shall come back to it on Clause 10 and Schedule 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is wise and, perhaps, discreet, not to involve himself in too great detail about Part III of Schedule 6 at this stage, for I discover that it is 11 pages long. Therefore, we have a fairly complicated issue to return to. I think it would be wise and discreet on other parts also to reserve our position until we come to the relevant part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 66, in page 79, line 33, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'but nothing contained in this sub-paragraph shall operate so as to prevent any expenditure incurred after the first separate disposal being taken into account on the occasion of any subsequent determination of relevant base value on a later separate disposal'.</p></blockquote>
We are dealing with expenditure on improvements. The Explanatory Note on this paragraph is, again, one of those which is a great deal briefer than the text of the Bill. It states about paragraph 4:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In calculating expenditure on improvements (or on relevant improvements)"—</p></blockquote>
we have already discovered the critical difference between improvements and relevant improvements—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the amounts which would have been attributable to the separate parts of the assembly, if they had been separately disposed of at the time of the actual disposal, are aggregated."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, that seems fair and proper. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify the situation, and it should, perhaps, be interpreted as a probing amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one disposes of an assembly of land in pieces, expenditure on improvements on some of the pieces that one has not disposed of is admissible, even after one has disposed of the first piece of the sequence of disposals. It may only be a matter of interpretation but the subparagraph as worded could be interpreted as debarring expenditure on improvements incurred after the first of a series of disposals of a site which has been assembled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hence, we have tabled the amendment to clarify the point. I regard it as a probing amendment, but if the Minister will not say that it was the intention to disbar such expenditure on improvements,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0862">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>543</span>
it will clearly become an amendment of more serious purport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest. I accept that it is a probing amendment and that it is difficult for the hon. Gentleman to see how his situation is met. I shall go through it as slowly as possible and try to explain why there is no difficulty and why expenditure on improvements will still be allowed, even after a disposal of part of the assembled land. That would be a fair situation and that is what the Bill provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 of Schedule 2 is concerned with the calculation of expenditure on improvements or relevant improvements on the disposal of an assembly. In the case of a complete disposal it provides that the expenditure on improvements, or on relevant improvements, is the aggregate of the amounts which have been attributable to the separate parts of the assembly, if those parts had been separately disposed of at the time of the actual disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10(7) of Schedule 2 preserves, as the hon. Gentleman wants, the deduction for relevant improvements after a disposal of the part disposal of the assembled parts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 10(5) of Schedule 2 also ensures that, by making the time of acquisition of the retained interest, for this purpose, the time of the part disposal, in all cases there will be a deduction for relevant improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is not too unclear, but I assure the hon. Member that the point is covered and that expenditure will not be lost because there is a deemed disposal. The relevant improvements expenditure will continue to be carried on and will be available for the other parts of the land which have not been disposed of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) will comment on other occasions as to the order in which we take these things, but when one reads paragraph 10(5) in Part II of the schedule which refers on to paragraph 10(7), in conjunction with a cold towel round
	<span class='label label-info column'>544</span>
one's head, one sees that the matter is dealt with and, in the circumstances, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 131, in page 91, line 28, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'but so that in no case shall the consideration be brought into account prior to the actual date of its receipt'.</p></blockquote>
I am in need of that cold towel, Mr. Fitch!
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44 stipulates that the date of a disposal is the date of the binding contract. It is by no means unusual for a contract to make provision for separate parcels of land to be conveyed at intervals and for the purchase money to be paid as and when each parcel is conveyed. This is a relatively familiar situation in all forms of development and it seems proper and sensible that the disposal should be treated as a sequence of activities, each of which stands by itself. One does not find oneself paying tax upon a consideration which has not passed, and is not due to pass until a much later date under the terms of a contract. That would clearly be an adverse condition in such contracts and would be a discouragement to enter into them. It would be likely to lead to an increase in cost because of the need to finance the tax payment before receipt of the consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore hope that the Committee will accept the amendment. Again, perhaps the wording is not exactly right, but, if that is the case, I am sure we could reconsider it and come up with something more acceptable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I understand the hon. Gentleman, he referred to a case where there might be disposals of parts of land and the right to receive the money when there was first one disposal and then another. I am not sure from his amendment, whether if the money was not received, the right to receive the money arose on those disposals. I think he said that the money was not received until the whole transaction was completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, there is a right to receive the money at the time of the disposals, as the legislation runs tax is payable once the right to receive consideration arises. We dealt with this
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0863">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>545</span>
matter in connection with Clause 1 and Clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Development land tax is a tax, not on receipts, but on the right to receive money. Once there is a right to collect the money, the tax applies as it does with other taxes. If that were not the case, there might be all sorts of situations where the Revenue would be denied its tax. For example, a person could borrow on the right to receive the money and keep himself in pocket without actually receiving the money or paying the tax. It might be possible to sell for a lump sum the right to receive the money. The person who sold the right to receive the money would get an equivalent sum, or slightly less—it would be discounted sum—and, again, that would not enter into the tax computation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such cases, the Revenue would not be protected. Although it may seem at first sight that people should pay tax only on receipt of money, the hon. Gentleman will find that in most cases tax is payable on the right to receive money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 21 of the Schedule follows the capital gains tax rule that there is to be no discount for postponement of the right to receive any part of money. Therefore, if one postpones the right to receive the money, the sum cannot be discounted for the purpose of a tax computation thereby reducing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see that in some cases there might be problems of hardship. Indeed, there are provisions by which, if hardship can be proved, the Revenue can allow the tax to be deferred and spread—unfortunately, with payment of interest. It is not like the provision with regard to a deemed disposal where the tax can be spread automatically and where interest is not payable on the instalments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An exactly similar provision is in the capital gains tax legislation. I do not think that the provision has caused many problems in that legislation, but I see that there might be difficulty in some cases. However, the Inland Revenue is empowered to accept payment spread over instalments, but only with the payment of interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that does not deal adequately with the hon. Gentleman's query. I understand that to be the kind of situation to which he referred. I am not able to accept the amendment, because it would mean that we would have to overturn
	<span class='label label-info column'>546</span>
the whole basis of the legislation which is on the right to receive money, and not on the receipt of money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether the Minister will help us further. I understand his argument that this is not really a probing amendment but goes to the basis of the type of tax with which we are dealing. Clearly it is in conflict with what is specifically stated in paragraph 21(1) (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the Revenue has the power to postpone the time of collection, but will he tell us from where that power arises? Does it arise from the general power of collecting taxation, or is it to be found in this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Schedule 8(50).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman. This is a very serious point because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) said, most larger developments can be carried out only by various forms of phasing. Of course, contractual obligations are entered into by which the owner of the land is under an obligation to sell later tranches or parts of the land. But quite plainly it would impose considerable difficulties in financing land development if all developers had to buy all the land initially and then had to finance a great deal of what I might call dead land during the whole of the development period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we would be very grateful if the Minister could kindly explain how this system of phase payment will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With all respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), his example did not really come within the amendment but it was an example which I hope that the Secretary of State will consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment deals specifically with the case of receipt of the consideration. I appreciate that, under the Bill as it stands, tax liability arises on the right to receive any part of the consideration. But if there is a contract such as my hon. Friend the Member for Hove put to the Minister under which the right to receive parts of the purchase money does not arise until something happens—usually something within the power of the purchaser: he starts a development on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0864">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>547</span>
land, he obtains a planning permission, or something of that sort—although there will be a right to receive the whole of the contract price, it will be a right which arises only when something else happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether this will be appropriate elsewhere when we deal with contingent contracts, but there is the problem that if a contract is split in that way—to use the words in paragraph 21(1)(	<i>a</i>)—there is no right to receive the consideration on these separate parts until the event occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one point put by my hon. Friend, but we are dealing under paragraph 21 with the valuation of the consideration rather than the incidence of the tax. The tax is payable, with refinements, on a consideration, or the amount of consideration which is above the base value, but the right to receive money some time hence is not to the same value as the right to receive money now. In fact, as the Minister said, perhaps one could sell one's right to receive that money ahead. He admitted, if I heard him aright, that one would be able to sell it for a little less—that is exactly it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill stands, the valuation for tax purposes when the consideration is postponed is being made on something which is not real. The right to receive money at a future date is of less value than the right to receive it today; and it is the valuation of that right to receive the money which should be the consideration upon which the calculation of the tax is based.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a normal concept, although it has a crazy logic of its own, that the right to receive a consideration is a taxable event. I envisage that the actor signing his contract for the run of a play, or even for a year's run, would resent being taxed upon his weekly remuneration at the time of the signing of his contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, I think that any landlord might reasonably say, when he signed a lease which stated that there should be a weekly, monthly or quarterly payment in advance or in arrears, that merely because he had a right to receive in the future did not mean there should then be a tax payment on all that stream of income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>548</span>
The most important point is that drawn to our attention by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page)—that in property valuation the right to receive a sum of money in the future is considerably less valuable in these inflationary days than the right to have the money immediately. The valuation of rental, particularly in reversions or, indeed, of conditional contracts, must take into account the period which will elapse before that money is actually received. Therefore, this is clearly a matter of some importance. It would be quite unjust to value as if they were already to hand moneys to be received in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I first deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) regarding hardship? In fact, the reference is to paragraph 50(1) of Schedule 8—where the consideration is payable by instalments of capital the Board may, if it considers that the taxpayer would otherwise suffer undue hardship, permit the tax to be paid by instalments but with interest running on the instalments. That is a specific provision which enables the Inland Revenue to accept the tax by instalments in cases of hardship. There is a similar provision in paragraph 14(1) of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1965 in relation to capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point raised by the right hon. Gentleman, which is a fair one. We are here taxing a right to receive a consideration. If we were doing a computation, I suppose we would bring in the right to receive money, not the money itself. As we have argued before, this is a tax on the right to receive money, not on the receipt of money. If one is bringing in the right to receive money, the right hon. Gentleman says that we should value the right to receive that money on the basis of what it is worth at that particular time. For various reasons, it may be worth less when it comes in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is the difficulty, not only in this legislation but in the capital gains tax legislation, that it would lead to innumerable problems relating to discounting and deciding what a right was worth. There would be all kinds of difficult considerations to take into account. That is one reason why the legislation does not allow for a discounting of the value of that right to take
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0865">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>549</span>
into account the fact that later on the money might be worth a little less. This would depend on the rate of inflation and the length of time during which the money was to be paid. At the end of the day, it would, of course, depend upon the bargain made between vendor and purchaser. These also are matters which might be taken into account. The consideration might be determined by the fact that the money was not to be received for a longer period. These are matters for determination between the parties, and that, too, might lead to great difficulties in discounting the value of the right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told that in the case of rent, which is a prime example of delayed consideration, the valuation allows discounting. I cannot point to a subparagraph now, but I am advised that in the case of rent discounting is allowed. However, the right hon. Gentleman is right that generally the paragraph provides that one is not allowed to discount the right to receive money in determining tax payable in respect of the value of that right. As I said, this applies also to capital gains tax legislation. It would lead to innumerable difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is not entirely satisfactory to the right hon. Gentleman, but the legislation is thus framed because of the practical difficulties of discounting determining the rate of inflation, and all the other problems that would arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot go further. I have tried to explain the problem to the Committee and how we are trying to solve it. I accept that, from the Opposition's point of view, it is not entirely satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am now told that the right to discount rent is contained in Schedule 2(26); so, at least in relation to rent, which is a delayed payment, and perhaps the more common form of delayed payment, discounting is provided for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards other capital payments, this is not the case. The procedure follows the capital gains tax legislation, and I should have thought that there would be considerable difficulties if one started to allow a discounting procedure in respect of these rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having listened carefully to what the Minister has said in his two contributions I do not think we should leave the matter there. The Minister went so far as to say that he recognises that we
	<span class='label label-info column'>550</span>
have a fair case to put but that there are such practical difficulties in the way of meeting it that it is best to pretend that that case does not exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of development land tax it is not entirely fair to quote as a precedent the capital gains tax because of the very different rates at which they will be charged. A rate of tax, which in many cases may be 80 per cent., is so high that I believe it is necessary for the Government to reconsider whether they are not able to make one of two sorts of arrangement to meet the point which my right hon. and hon. Friends have made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is an Act regulating development land tax which makes no provision for recognising the difference in value of the right to receive money at a specified time in the future, whether or not that right is conditional on anything else happening in the meantime, it will complicate and frustrate many of the normal patterns of settlement which take place in commercial transactions relating to land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The most sensible thing would have been to allow a standard form of discounting on the same or a similar basis to those recognised for many other financial purposes. It is easy to evaluate a lump sum to be received in the future: insurance companies are doing it every day of the year and there is a commercial market for such rights, given certainty of receipt and discounting any commercial risk about whether the money will actually be paid. These calculations are done in the ordinary course of calculating annuities and future receipts by insurance companies, pensions funds, and so on, as a regular part of their business. It would be perfectly reasonable to make some provision for this type of discounting to apply. It may be that, if such was permitted, a minimum period of, perhaps, a year should be introduced shorter than which these provisions could not be invoked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other way of dealing with it would be to postpone the taxation in regard to postponed receipts until such time as the money is received, and this point underlies the amendment. That, again, seems to be a sensible way of doing it if there is no reasonable way in which the recipient can obtain money beforehand. But if recipients were to be able to sell that right, it would only be fair that they should trigger off the liability at the time at which they turned that future right to receive money into a receipt of money, and we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0866">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>551</span>
should certainly have no objection to proposals on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise again that capital gains tax and development land tax cannot be regarded as entirely comparable in a case of this kind because of the vast discrepancy in the rates of interest where 80 per cent. may be more than the complete value of the sum to be received in the future only two years hence. If one discounts it at a flat rate of 10 per cent. per annum, which is optimistic these days, one would get down to 80 per cent., and over a period of, say, three or five years, and taking realistic commercial rates of interest, one would get down to 50 per cent. or even 40 per cent. of the value of the ultimate money to be received. Therefore, with a tax which even at its more generous level is at 66⅔ per cent. but which at its standard rate is 80 per cent. it seems that there could be scope either for preventing what has hitherto been regarded as a perfectly legitimate form of commercial transaction or else imposing very severe, in fact penal, hardship and confiscation on those who may have entered or who need to enter into such arrangements in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the arguments which have been put forward very moderately and sensibly by both sides. The Minister of State is in a difficulty and ought to reconsider this position. It is grossly unfair for the Treasury to continue its persistent fraud of pretending that there are not heavy rates of inflation and saying blandly that it would be extremely inconvenient to recognise the normal commercial habit of discounting, and discounting largely for the prospective rate of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The more one hears the figures put forward by those who are professionally involved in the management of money the more obvious it becomes that this right to collect all the tax at an early stage will be gravely disadvantageous to the taxpayer. It is even more objectionable, I suggest, to leave it to the Revenue to decide how the tax should be collected according to something so vague as hardship. It puts the Revenue in an impossible position. The whole essence of the Revenue's position must always be "This is the law. We will apply the law impartially. We have little or no discretion. It is not according to whether
	<span class='label label-info column'>552</span>
we like you or whether we do not like you: according to whether you are rich or whether you are poor, whether you have a long nose or a short nose. This is the law, and we will apply it. If you do not like the law", the Revenue ought to be able to say to the taxpayer, "then you should campaign to get the law changed."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty about leaving the Revenue with a fallback position based on something so strange and unknown and unknowable as the criterion of hardship is that it is left in a position where it has such a wide discretion that there is a serious danger that it may be thought to be partial as between various classes of taxpayers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the position of two property companies. One company might be making very substantial profits and might say to the Revenue "We do not wish to pay all our tax immediately. Owing to there being no discounting factor in the payment of this tax, we will suffer a hardship." The Revenue might reply "No. You might suffer a disadvantage but you will not suffer a hardship." The taxpayer might say "How do you define hardship?" The Revenue might reply "We define hardship according to what we regard as hardship."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second property company might genuinely be in difficulties, on the verge of going bust. The Revenue would doubtless be forced to say "All right, we will allow you to phase your payment of development land tax because we have a discretion under the hardship clause." That may be a possibility. But I suggest to the Committee that it is an extremely dangerous duty and discretion to cast upon the Revenue. We are in grave danger of giving it a position where it may lose its impartiality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that it would be much more open and straight forward to recognise that fast rates of inflation, which are not entirely caused by the present administration, are matters which the Revenue has now got to take into account. Its only honest way of doing so is to recognise the need for discounting in the application of this tax and to avoid putting the Revenue in what coud be a partial situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

the Minister of State. I know that he will accept my remarks in the spirit in which they are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal of substance in the amendment. If one took the current cost of discounting—the equivalent of discounted cash flow—and if payment were received approximately 18 months after it was agreed to be paid, after allowing for 80 per cent. tax there would be no net benefit to the party with the right to that payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend rightly says, if this amendment were agreed in its present form I have no doubt that 20 or 30 devices would be immediately produced designed to take advantage of the arrangement. I have been thinking on these lines for the last few minutes and that is why I felt compelled to rise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend might well be able to consider the matter on the basis that the consideration might not be brought into account either before the date of actual receipt or before any sums were received by way of loan on that potential right. The point would be met if the amendment could be rephrased, or if my hon. Friend could accept an amendment which would mean that the liability for tax would arise, not merely when the sum was received, but when a loan was raised upon it or some other benefit was collaterally obtained As the schedule stands, however, it is clear that, if a payment were not received for roughly 17 or 18 months after the right to it arose, the party with that right would get absolutely no benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) has emphasised the commercial importance of this type of transaction. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) referred to penalising it, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) referred to a tax which has a rate of 80 per cent. and pointed out how different this is from capital gains tax and capital transfer tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eighty per cent. is only starters, we are told in documents outside the text of this Bill: it will ultimately be 100 per cent, but to have to pay tax on 100 per cent. of money one does not have is a penal provision. The problem is that the Revenue detects the possibility of some method, to which the hon. Gentleman has just referred, of avoiding paying the
	<span class='label label-info column'>554</span>
tax. It ignores the difficulties which occur to commercial taxpayers. It concerns itself solely with its own difficulties. I think that the Revenue should take this provision away and come back with something which recognises reality and does not again ask us to say that something should be taxed as if an event has occurred which has not occurred. If the Minister is not prepared to reconsider his position on this matter, my right hon. and hon. Friends will no doubt support me in a division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I reiterate one point which was perhaps not clear in my opening address. We are concerned here with the situation where parties enter into a contract. In most cases, they will be two parties who will both be in property development business and who will agree to receive money in a certain way in respect of a development. The parties will negotiate a price and the sums to be payable under the contract. No doubt such parties will take into account, as at present, any postponement of a right to receive money, and one party will need to bring the full value into computation for development land tax purposes, at possibly 80 per cent. This factor will no doubt be taken into account in negotiation. We are not concerned with a simple situation. We are concerned with contracts which are drafted in this way to take into account the fact that the money received at the end of the day may be worth less, but tax is payable on the right to receive that money which may be greater in value than the money which actually comes in. These are matters for negotiation between the parties and are not arbitrary decisions imposed outside the contract.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a real danger that the Minister of State and those advising him will listen only to those who are well qualified in property matters, and will assume that all contracts in relation to development land are necessarily carried out by the big builders. The financial inducements will be towards developing greenfield sites during the next two or three years. As one who knows nothing of the metropolitan property scene but who has seen a little of the provincial property scene, my experience is that a great deal of this green land is sold by farmers and other such people
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0868">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>555</span>
who are badly advised. To pretend that all persons who sell land are big property companies with a wealth of highly paid and expert professional advisers, is nonsense.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point the hon. Gentleman made. I said previously that some people may be badly advised. In my experience, they are not farmers, but I do not want to pursue that matter. The point I was making was that in most cases these contracts will take that into account, but I accept that there is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the capital gains tax treatment. I did not mean to imply that merely because the provision is used for capital gains tax it should absolutely and unconditionally be in the Bill for this tax. I concede that the two taxes are different. But the capital gains tax experience helps us to highlight the problem of accepting the proposed amendment. I understand that the present capital gains tax treatment, which this legislation follows, was introduced in 1972. The changes in the capital gains tax legislation were made because there were problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I use the word "avoidance", there will be howls and speeches from hon. Members opposite to the effect that we are always worried about avoidance. But by 1972 the previous Conservative Government had recognised that there was a problem in respect of avoidance over capital gains tax and the law had to be changed to try to stop it. We are trying to follow that change in this legislation. I am putting that forward, not as a conclusive argument, but to indicate the difficulties in this area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) made the point very clearly when he said that he could think of many ways in which the matter could be manipulated. That is one of the difficulties we face. This kind of provision has been manipulated in the past. The kind of provision which the hon. Gentleman wishes to have in
	<span class='label label-info column'>556</span>
the legislation was manipulated for capital gains tax purposes and the last Conservative Government tightened the rules to take that into account.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the Revenue cannot find the method of dealing with such a simple transaction as a sale by a developer to a user which includes initial payment and a subsequent payment by the user after the developer has completed certain construction work?

Why are you worried about avoidance?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors might be able to draft a clause. I do not know, but whether it would be foolproof is another matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the problem. I wish I could go some way towards meeting it, but, if one were to do that, it would involve looking at the capital gains tax legislation in general. I do not think it would be fair for me to say "Yes, I will look at it sympathetically."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I can tell the Committee that I will look again at what happened in 1972 and the reasons the legislation was changed to see whether one can learn from that experience and whether something could be deduced from that in relation to this legislation. That does not mean that I can accept the amendment. I will look at the 1972 situation and to see how it has worked in practice to see whether there have been difficulties and representations since 1972.

I am prepared to consider the matter in that light, but I do not want to give right hon, and hon. Members any feeling of hope that I can accept the amendment.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry; I meant to deal with the hardship provisions. If the Board of Inland Revenue is given discretion to determine hardship, then it is given that discretion. Sometimes there might be inconsistency. The Board would do its best to ensure that there were no inconsistencies, but sometimes, of course, there may be some. Hardship provisions, of course, apply not only to this tax, but to income tax. There is a discretion regarding income tax where hardship exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My limited experience is that these provisions are interpreted humanely, and great efforts are made to ensure that there is no hardship, in a colloquial sense, in the collection of tax. The Inland Revenue is extremely sympathetic. That may not sound very convincing to hon. Gentlemen. In practice, if they saw these cases, they would recognise that there was great sympathy and a considerable attempt to bend over backwards to ensure that, in a genuine case, the taxpayer was not inconvenienced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that when a board is given discretion over hardship, there may be certain inconsistencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other way of dealing with the matter would be to frame legislation to cover all kinds of hardship, which would be even more inflexible and might create more anomalies than the present discretion given to the Board.

Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) will be grateful for the Minister's offer to reconsider this matter in the light of our debate. I ask the Minister, when he does, to take into account the constructive suggestion made by his hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) regarding raising money against a future sum to be received. Is it possible to consider drafting some provision to the effect that any deferment of tax liability or any right to take a discounted value should be forfeited
	<span class='label label-info column'>558</span>
automatically when that right is turned into money by sale, by borrowing, or in any other way? The critical point is that, because of high rates of tax—whether 66⅔ per cent., 80 per cent., 90 per cent. or 100 per cent.—any sum due in future is likely to be discounted close to or below those levels in a short space of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong if, because of the understandable difficulties of dealing with potential tax avoidance, the Act were to contain a provision which would effectively close off a perfectly legitimate way of doing business. For example, a company wishing to acquire an investment in property might have an existing investment, perhaps with a reversion on a lease in three, five or 21 years, on which there was a vast increase in value. That asset would be available to the company to sell and realise the money to pay out a capital sum in either three or five years. In those circumstances, it would not be in a position to make an adjustment with the other party by dealing with the matter through interest in the interim. It would have an expectation of a capital sum of a certain amount. As a result, it would then be able to enter into a contract for a capital sum, but not for a period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That type of transaction is not uncommon. It is perfectly reasonable, especially where there are different phases of development. That applies not only to housing estates, but to factory estates in the development of a new town or the expansion of an existing town with a new commercial accent. The pace of industrial development can only go as fast as accommodation is provided for new workers and as the infrastructure of the town gradually develops to take account of the extra industry which is hoped for in the locality. There are a considerable number of legitimate financial and commercial industrial reasons why it would be a great pity if, as a result of the Bill, certain types of transaction of that kind were precluded because of the effect of taxation.

When the Minister considers what happened in 1972, he should bear in mind that this is a tax on land. Therefore, perhaps he will consult some of the professional bodies, to which he is fond of making reference, and bear in mind that we are concerned with the normal process of commercial and industrial development. If people are made to pay for something before they get the benefit of it, their operating costs are increased. If the Minister can devise a method which will satisfy the Revenue's worries about avoidance and recognise the realities of normal commercial transactions in developed land and the rates of tax implied in the Bill, I think that he will have done something to help commercial and industrial property users. I hope that he will give the matter a really hard look. We shall have an opportunity of coming back to this matter at a later stage, but, in the light of what the Minister said, for which we are grateful, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>an interest in land is disposed of subject to a mortgage or charge, and</li>
	<li>the consideration for the disposal is less than it would be if the mortgage or charge were not continuing after the disposal, and</li>

	<br><blockquote><p>(2) In this paragraph "mortgage or charge" means an interest falling within paragraph (	<i>a</i>) or paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of subsection (2) of section 45 of this Act.'</p></blockquote>
This amendment is intended to ensure that where a person disposes of an interest in land subject to a mortgage or charge, as when an equity of redemption

Normally, when a person sells an interest in land which has been the security for a mortgage, he often repays the mortgage loan out of the sale proceeds and conveys the interest free of the charge. Clause 7(5), which we discussed previously, provides that, in determining market value and current use value, any mortgage or charge on the interest in land is ignored and so ensures that calculations of realised development value are based upon the value of the interest itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Occasionally—perhaps more than occasionally, as hon. Gentlemen will know—the purchaser takes over the vendor's mortgage and buys the equity of redemption. When this happens, the interest that is sold is the interest in land subject to the continuing mortgage, and the price paid is correspondingly lower than it would have been if the unencumbered interest had been sold. As the Bill is drafted, the realised development value would be understated in such a case if only the cash consideration were taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment puts matters right by adjusting the consideration for the disposal of the interest in land for the purposes of the tax. To the actual consideration there is to be added an amount equal to the principal outstanding under the mortgage. The realised development value will accordingly be calculated by comparing like with like—consideration and current use value unaffected by the charge upon the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment goes into the schedule it will be read with Clause 7(5). I will give an example of what will happen when the two parts are read together. If a person sells land worth £100,000 which has a mortgage of £40,000 on it, that land could be sold for £60,000, which would be the cash consideration for the sale, subject to the purchaser taking over the mortgage. The purchaser's cost of acquisition would be £100,000, but the actual cash consideration, not the legal consideration, would be £60,000. As the Bill is drafted it would not be possible to take account of the fact that the vendor has been relieved of a debt of £40,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment regularises the position between vendor and purchaser. The vendor is treated as having sold for £100,000 and the purchaser is deemed to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0871">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>561</span>
have bought for £100,000. Previously that would not have been the case. The amendment makes the position right at both ends of the scale. Of course, there is no question of an increased tax charge. The amendment merely reflects the reality of the situation when land is bought subject to a mortgage and the consideration received by the vendor includes the lifting of this heavy burden of debt—if it is a heavy burden of debt—off his shoulders, and that, of course, is worth some money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that explanation, I hope that the Committee will be happy to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although we have not had much time to consider the amendment, I feel sure that my hon. Friends will accept its logic and reasonableness. Last week, in our debate on Clause 7, this question of disallowing any allowance for a mortgage or charge in the value was generally understood to be a reasonable provision. The Minister of State has now explained the logic which we felt lay behind his amendment and given us a perfectly clear example of how it would work in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is just one aspect which I should like to raise. Has account been taken of the possibility that the indebtedness on the mortgage may not have been fully discharged or assumed by the purchaser? Suppose, in the example we were given, the £100,000 consideration had taken into account an outstanding debt of £40,000 and the purchase consideration of £60,000, but, in the process, the financial arrangements which enabled the new buyer to acquire the property or the land had included the discharge of the existing mortgage at a figure lower than £40,000 because the lender was not happy about the previous borrower. In those circumstances the ultimate value might only be £90,000 or £80,000. I wonder whether that point has been taken into account. Does the Minister feel that, at a time when there is still a good deal of distress amongst companies owning mortgaged property which may have changed hands recently, this new amendment fairly deals with the point?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the amendment although, like my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart), I have a question to raise on it. The disposal of land which is subject to mortgage is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>562</span>
perfectly regular situation. Small builders tend to buy land by mortgage financed by their local clearing banks. If for some reason a site proves unsuccessful, if company is faced with liquidation, or a the man concerned wants to retire and close down his business, he frequently has to sell the land subject to the charge. Therefore, is it right that this should be taken into account in any tax provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister one small technical question to which there may be a simple answer. Suppose circumstances arise in which a piece of land is mortgaged—using the Minister's example of £100,000 and £40,000—and for various reasons the purchaser is not prepared to accept the land subject to that form of encumbrance. The vendor may manage to make certain alternative arrangements. He may succeed in lifting the mortgage by repaying the £40,000 prior to sale by means of mortgaging some other piece of land in his possession. The piece of land would then be sold at its full market value of £100,000 For the purposes of development land tax, would there be any possibility of the vendor taking into account the servicing costs of the mortgage which he has taken out on the new piece of land in order to sell the other piece of land unencumbered?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make the question slightly more complicated by asking for an answer in two separate circumstances: first, where the vendor is an individual sole trader subject to income tax, secondly, where the vendor is a company subject to corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise one tiny drafting point with the Minister. This is a plea for helping the reader to understand the Bill. When I first read the amendment I found the drafting of the words "to the amount" at the top of page 143 of the Order Paper somewhat impeding. I read paragraphs (	<i>a</i>),(	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>), and they were perfectly clear. Then I went straight to a preposition—"to the amount". I thought there must be some words missed out, and I read it through again. I realised that it was "to the amount—"then one and a half lines on—"there shall be added". Is it not possible to have the words "there shall be added" directly after (	<i>a</i>),(	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>c</i>) and "to the amount" later? I reverse the grammar of that particular sentence, because I assure the Minister that I had to read it two or three times before I saw the point at issue. This is a tiny drafting point.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0872">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>563</span>
It would not mean anything at all to the Minister to make such a change, and it certainly would not alter the meaning of the amendment. But it would slightly help the unfortunate person who has to try to read the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we welcome the amendment. However, I am interested that the Minister should have used the word "reality". It is interesting thst, when reality means that more tax will be paid, he is very keen to recognise reality as meaning that events shall be taken to be real, not imaginary, events which the Revenue occasionally dreams up to its advantage. I wonder whether he could apply this new belief in reality to other sections of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to point to another example of the drafting complexities of the Bill. In order to understand the amendment, we have to refer forward to Clause 45, where we have a definition of "mortgage or charge", and backwards to Clause 7(5), which deals with disposal by mortgage. Before this Bill comes back at a later stage, somebody should carefully go through the sequencing of clauses and schedules and their relationship. I fear that the people who have to conduct their business within the framework of this legislation will find it incredibly complicated. Alternatively, whoever is to try to write a guide for the benefit of householders and other dealers in commercial property will have a formidable task. Perhaps the Minister will lend some of the expertise which is available to him towards helping the public to understand his master work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of questions have been asked. I will deal, first, with the question of reality.

On the two points of substance, I have had a note which purports to deal with both, but I do not understand it. Since I do not understand it, I do not propose to read it to the Committee.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will make me very happy indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. All of these amendments deal with the incidental costs which one takes into account in calculating the consideration for the disposal of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4(3) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"References in this Act to the net proceeds of the disposal of an interest in land are references to the consideration for the disposal, less the incidental costs to the chargeable person of making the disposal."</p></blockquote>
To find out what the incidental costs are one turns to Part VI of Schedule 2. They are rather narrowly defined. Paragraph 31(1) describes them as
	<br><blockquote><p>"wholly and exclusively incurred by him "—</p></blockquote>
that is, the chargeable person—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of the acquisition or, as the case may be, the disposal."</p></blockquote>
The provision refers to "the disposal" and it also contains the words "wholly and exclusively". It may be that some of the expenses have been incurred in endeavouring to dispose of the land in a general way and not specifically incurred in the disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0873">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>565</span>
For example, if there has been a considerable amount of advertising for the sale of the property, I should hope that that would be wholly and exclusively incurred within this paragraph. However, it it not entirely clear whether it is. Therefore, in Amendment No. 132 we try to make quite certain that the incidental costs will include expenditure in seeking to dispose of the land even if that particular disposal has failed. Of course, if it has failed, no tax incidence will arise. But if there is another disposal later, the whole of the costs should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 seeks to extend the professional services for which commission or remuneration is paid in the efforts to dispose of the land—and, indeed, to obtain advice about that disposal and the liability to tax, which is going to be a very large part of the expenditure in these cases considering what the tax may be. In the Bill, as it stands, Schedule 2, Part VI, paragraph 31(2) refers only to the professional services
	<br><blockquote><p>"of any legal adviser, surveyor, valuer, auctioneer, accountant or agent, and any other costs of conveyance or transfer (including stamp duty)".</p></blockquote>
But there are many other professional people from whom an owner or developer will have to take advice. Therefore, by Amendment No. 133 we seek to add after "agent" the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"or consultant in engineering building, building services, town planning, public health or other matters affecting land."</p></blockquote>
These are vital matters in developing land and in preparing for its disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not wedded to the list. If the Minister thinks it is too wide or not wide enough, I am willing to listen to suggestions on it. But this is in the same category as consultation with surveyors, valuers, auctioneers, accountants, or to use a rather wide phrase, "agents".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 53 seeks to deal with the cost for professional services in computing the development land tax liability of the chargeable person. As I have said, I think this will be a major point in the costs of disposal of an interest in land. Having regard to the complications of the Bill, I think that it should be recognised that these are incidental costs which will be taken into account in ascertaining, under Clause 4(3):
	<br><blockquote><p>"the net proceeds of the disposal of an interest in land".</p></blockquote>
These are matters which, as I am sure the Minister knows, have been troubling
	<span class='label label-info column'>566</span>
not only the landowners and the developers but the professional men. If one is cheeseparing over the incidental costs which can be brought into account in calculating the consideration, I am sure that the landowners and developers will endeavour to economise on this and the result will be difficulties not only for landowners and developers but for the Revenue as well. I should have thought it would be to the great advantage of both sides to seek professional services and not to have to economise because their cost might not come into the cost of the calculation of the consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) for moving the amendments. They are extremely important amendments and I hope that the Government will see fit to accept them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say a word briefly about Amendment No. 133 first? If the Government take the view, which it is possible they do, that the word "agent" is sufficiently wide to include in its remit all the words contained in Amendment No. 133, I hope that they will cite evidence for their belief, whether or not it be court cases. If they do not believe that and accept that the word "agent" is not sufficiently wide to cover all those considerations, I hope that they will accept the amendment or produce one of their own to meet the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the services listed in the amendment have a very important and growing part to play in the development process. As large schemes come on to the market, the developer will more and more have to use outside consultant services to assist him to prepare planning permission or to get the site going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, after acquisition of the land, the fees of these various services can be put within the expenditures on improvements permitted in Schedule 3. Unless the amendment, which deals with the position prior to acquisition, is accepted, it appears that it will not be possible to offset their fees against the proceeds. There appears to be a discrepancy there with the situation contained in Schedule 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Amendment No. 132. Again, I stress the importance of the amendment, remembering that we are talking about development land tax at either 66⅔ per
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0874">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>567</span>
cent. or 80 per cent. as opposed to corporation tax at 52 per cent. If the level of development land tax were at corporation tax rates, there would no need for this amendment. In-house costs of unsuccessful land finding exercises or, indeed, unsuccessful appeals—for example, unrealised options or conditional contracts which do not come to fruition because for some reason the land disappears from the market or is no longer suitable for development—are a basic part of the builder's stock in trade. Just as a building contractor, as opposed to a developer, obviously has to load his tender to account for the unsuccessful tenders—tendering is, of course, an on-cost—so a developer has to load into the land price the unsuccessful exercises in other directions. That is, of course, a normal part of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present such expenditure would be a deduction against corporation tax, but we are concerned here with tax at a higher level—development land tax—and that is where these expenditures should be permitted to be offset against development land tax at 80 per cent. or 66⅔ per cent. rather than the corporation tax rates at 52 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will favourably consider the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr Page) moved Amendment No. 132 together with Nos. 133 and 53.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 132 seeks to widen the words of the subparagraph to cater for a situation where somebody tries to dispose of land but may not be successful on that particular occasion. I think that that is an example of the occasion he has in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am bound to say that I think the words of the amendment go too far. Very often, of course, costs incurred in seeking to dispose of land may well be allowable when land is eventually disposed of. In a continuing situation—for instance, a valuation in respect of the first abortive disposal may be the same valuation used for the second successful disposal—then in most cases the cost would be allowed anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation where costs would not be allowed would probably be one in which there was a first valuation for the unsuccessful disposal followed by a second
	<span class='label label-info column'>568</span>
different valuation, updated at some future date because the first one was out of date, resulting in the second valuation referring merely to the ultimate disposal. In such a case, the cost of the first valuation would not be allowed. But if it is a continuing process of trying to sell land and eventually the land is sold, then in most cases the continuing costs would be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that that is not a very strict rule and that, in fact, some cases may fall either side of the line. But these matters are discussed between inspectors of taxes and developers. Development costs in general have been discussed in the past and normally, I think, a working arrangement is reached whereby costs incurred in continuing development are allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot therefore accept the amendment. Perhaps the present wording is not as strict and as narrow as hon. Gentlemen think. If the situation is a continuing one of trying to dispose of land, these costs normally would be allowable, though, of course, situations change.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has made an important statement this morning. Will he consider whether there is any way by which what he has said about continuing sales of sites can be written into the Bill? I ask him to think about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to say "No" immediately to a proposition without thought. I should have thought that, in practice, it is better not to put that kind of provision in the Bill. We would then get into difficulties of what is continuing and what is not. I think it would be better left to negotiation between the taxpayer and the tax authorities. I do not think that experience has shown hardship in cases of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be situations where a second disposal would take place years after the first disposal and there would be a completely new situation and valuation, and those costs would not be allowed. But often there would be a continuing process of putting up property for sale, being unable to sell it at that time, and then selling it a few months later and these costs frequently would be allowed in in respect of the ultimate disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 133 seeks to extend the fees payable from the categories
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0875">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>569</span>
listed in the subparagraph to various other categories of consultant engineers, public health consultants, and so on. I could not accept the amendment because the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"legal adviser, surveyor, valuer, auctioneer"</p></blockquote>
relate to the people directly involved in the disposal, and this is what the subparagraph aims to give relief for. The surveyor, the accountant, the lawyer may be directly involved in disposing of the land, but when we bring in public health inspectors, engineers and town planners we are getting into a much wider area. Perhaps their costs indirectly concern disposal of the land but they are not directly involved in the disposal of the land. One does not employ a town planner to sell land; one employs a valuer, a lawyer and possibly an accountant to sell land. One does not normally employ an engineer to sell land. So we are widening the scope considerably by pulling away from people who are directly involved to people who are indirectly involved in this provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has anticipated some of my arguments and taken some of the wind out of my sails. The last time he raised this matter I said these costs would have to go against corporation tax. That still stands, although I accept that corporation tax is at a lower rate. He said that these engineering, planning and public health costs were incurred in the development process. They are incurred, but it does not follow that they should be allowed as a deduction for betterment tax, if I may change the words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If such costs are incurred in the development process, they will probably be deductible in computing the development profit. The development profit will be charged to corporation tax. Many partnerships—not companies—will pay tax at a higher rate than 52 per cent. In the general nature of things, I should have thought that many of these costs would be part of the costs deductible in computing the profit of a development process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here with the disposal of land and the betterment charge in relation to the disposal of land. For that reason, it is more logical to confine the costs of employing people to the costs of the people directly involved in disposing
	<span class='label label-info column'>570</span>
of that land, such as valuers, auctioneers and lawyers. I was asked not to pray in aid the word "agent" in dealing with the amendments and I will not do so, because it would not be right, and the wording is in any case coloured by the wording which proceeds it. It does not cover the words in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 53 is an old one. It refers to development land tax in this case. It is the plea which one gets for VAT, for income tax, for capital gains tax and development tax to allow the cost of computing the tax at arriving at the tax liability. It has never been allowed by any Government. Whether that is a satisfactory answer I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
VAT is a special case, introduced by the Conservative Government, which imposes considerable burdens—far greater than this tax will ever impose—on far more people, many of them small traders who incur considerable work, if not expense, in computing liability. It has been accepted by Governments of both parties that costs incurred in ascertaining tax liability should not be deductible in computing that liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the cost of the preparation of accounts, if accounts are prepared by accountants, which are required for the purposes of the Companies Act is allowed in computing taxation and some of those costs no doubt have a constant relation to taxation. The costs are the costs of providing the accounts and not the costs of computing the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I am unable to agree with that amendment. It involves a radical departure from the way we operate our tax system, the main principle being that when Parliament imposes a tax, unfortunately, it expects the poor taxpayer to do the computation or to pay someone else to do it and does not give him relief for so doing. I am sorry to be so negative about the amendments, but I cannot recommend acceptance of any of them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his remarks on the first amendment about the costs of seeking to dispose of land and what he said about a continuing situation. I think we shall look into what he said a little further to see whether it covers the points we have in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), I should like to leave this matter vague, because once one starts
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0876">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>571</span>
to pin it down in detail to something like a continuing situation, perhaps the chargeable person would not come off quite so well. I do not wish to press that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Amendment No. 53, which deals with the costs of computing and negotiating the development land tax liability of the chargeable person. I agree with the Minister that there is precedent for refusing these as incidental costs. In the face of those precedents, it would be difficult for me to argue that in the case of development land tax they should be included, except to say that this is such an extremely difficult tax to compute that we might have made an exception in this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one amendment which I would wish to press is Amendment No. 133, which includes the professional services of a number of people other than the legal adviser and those named in the Bill as being directly connected with the acquisition or disposal of the land. The Minister has failed to grasp the point of this amendment. We are in this Bill dealing not merely with straight disposals, not only with a straight sale or lease of property, but with deemed disposals as well. As I understand it, incidental costs refer to deemed disposals just as much as to actual disposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paragraph was drawn with sales and leases in view. It refers to the
	<br><blockquote><p>"legal adviser, surveyor, valuer, auctioneer, accountant or agent ".</p></blockquote>
With regard to deemed disposals which are at the point of development, the Minister said we do not need a town planner. He</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>573</span>
	<i>persona</i> for 2 examples—although much of this schedule is in Wonderland and one can read it properly only by putting it up to the Looking Glass and then not really understand it. But I found the situations envisaged by the schedule more Gilbertian perhaps than "Alice-in-Wonderland", and that "The Mikado" was more appropriate than "Alice".</p>
	<p>We have already referred in other debates to the Palace of Middlesbrough, where the courtiers will be administering this Bill. Ko-Ko's palace in Titipu is probably more appropriate. Indeed, Mr. Fitch, you will recollect that the Japanese courtiers sang:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If you think we are worked by strings,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Like a Japanese marionette,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>You don't understand these things:</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is simply Court etiquette."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>As a commoner, a great deal of Schedule 2 appears to me to be court etiquette, and I must admit that I "don't understand these things". As the Three Little Maids said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"So please you, Sir, we much regret</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>If we have failed in etiquette".</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Let us assume, for example—and one can only deal with this schedule by trying to work out examples—that Pooh-Bah, who, one will remember was The Lord High Everything Else, has assembled several pieces of land, and several different interests in land. I choose Pooh-Bah because, amongst the offices of State in Titipu that he assembled, one was that of Paymaster-General, and we regret that Paymaster-General will shortly be leaving this Committee. At the time that Gilbert wrote "The Mikado" they had not thought about secretaryships of State for Prices, Consumer Protection, Consumer Credit, Fair Trading, Standards, Weights and Measures—all to be added to the position of Paymaster-General.</p>
	<p>So let us imagine that Pooh-Bah in accordance with Schedule 2, has assembled land of various interests and at various times. He has acquired the freehold of Castle Bunthorne from Patience: He has acquired the leasehold of Castle Adamant from Princess Ida: He has acquired as a gift from the Gondoliers, the Palace of Barataria. As stock-in-trade, he has acquired Tower Green from the Yeomen of the Guard.</p>
	<p>That, as I understand the Explanatory Note, is an assembly. But never mind that the properties are not contiguous. Or does it matter? Do the properties
	<span class='label label-info column'>574</span>
need to be contiguous in order to be an assembly and for us to apply the first part of the schedule? I ask, therefore what is the definition of an assembly? Can the parts of an assembly be geographically scattered. And when is an assembly not an assembly?</p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>If in our example, Pooh-Bah sells off his property except, say, the freehold of Castle Bunthorne, according to paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 2, Castle Bunthorne is not an assembly. Yet according to paragraph 1(3), it is part of the relevant interest which is the assembly by paragraph 1(1). Then again, if he acquired Castle Adamant from Princess Ida under two leases, by paragraph 2(1) it would not be an assembly. So my second question is: why do the various paragraphs on page 78 need to be so contradictory, and how does one reconcile them?</p>
	<p>I turn to paragraph 3, which is headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Time and cost of acquisition."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>This paragraph deals with gifts. Let us take the gift of the Palace of Barataria from the Gondoliers. It is not surprising that it was a gift when one remembers that Pooh-Bah was not averse to taking bribes, as when he told Ko-Ko that he would not be sufficiently degraded in his own estimation unless he was insulted with a very considerable bribe. So the gift of the Palace of Barataria is added to the other properties, and on adding all the individual current use values and costs of acquisition together, one finds one figure for the assembly.</p>
	<p>Clause 10(6), however, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In any case where by virtue of any provision of this Act an amount falls to be added to the amount which, apart from that provision, would be the cost of acquisition of an interest in land then … the acquisition shall not be treated for the purposes of this Act as being an acquisition for which no consideration was given."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>If, then, we marry the gift property to the rest of the assembly—that is, if it becomes part of the assembled land—according to Clause 10(6) the gift can never be a gift. How nicely Gilbertian that is. As Yum Yum would have said—
	<br><blockquote><p>"If what I say is true,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>'Tis death to marry you!</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Here's a pretty state of things!</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Here's a pretty how-de-do."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Question three, therefore, is: how does one reconcile paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 with Clause 10(6)?</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0878">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>575</span>
	<p>Paragraph 3 goes carefully into how one allots expenditure on improvements. Here Pooh-Bah has a problem, because in gratitude for the arrangement of the marriage with Yum-Yum, Nanki-Poo has built some bathrooms on to Castle Adamant without any charge.</p>
	<p>Question four is: what does one do about a gift of improvements? Paragraph 4 does not seem to think about the situation of improvements being given. Other paragraphs talk about property being given, but I do not know what one would do where the clause does not deal with that. As the Mikado said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That's the slovenly way in which these Acts are always drawn."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>He added
	<br><blockquote><p>"However, cheer up, it'll be all right. I'll have it altered next session."</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>Pooh-Bah, enamoured by the Three Little Maids from School, proposes to sell them, as joint tenants, part of Castle Bunthorne, for example. I hesitate to raise the problems of joint tenants, as we may need to return to that matter later. Nevertheless, Pooh-Bah, when he comes to sell the properties, wants to know all about bases A, B and C, and so he nonchalantly sings—
	<br><blockquote><p>"See how the Fates their gifts allot,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>For A is happy—B is not."</p></blockquote>
and so on.</p>
	<p>Apparently if Pooh-Bah is selling one part like this, even a part of one of his castles—let us say a part of Castle Bunthorne—he has to have the whole of Castle Bunthorne, the whole of Castle Adamant, the whole of the Palace of Barataria, and the whole of Tower Green valued, so that the current use values and market values of them all can be added together and divided again in order to find the current use value on acquisition and on disposal of only a part. Is this right?</p>
	<p>So question 5 is: When disposing of part of an assembly, does one have to value all the parts of that assembly and then apportion the total in order to discover the current use value of each bit?</p>
	<p>Another question follows quickly on the heels of that one. So question 6 is: Where on earth does the deemed disposal fit in with all this? Much of the schedule seems to be written with the actual disposal in mind. Let us suppose, for example, that Pooh-Bah wants to build some offices in the grounds of the Palace of
	<span class='label label-info column'>576</span>
Barataria in order to carry out his duties as groom of the Back Stairs and the Second Floor front, or whatever he was. Does he have to value his other two castles and Tower Green, too, and then apportion the aggregate current use values and market values? That is, of course, if they are an assembly, which comes back to my first question—that I am not sure whether they are all an assembly unless they are all contiguous.</p>
	<p>I suppose that in this connection it would be too unkind to ask whether one can have an actual deemed disposal or a deemed actual disposal, but we are told by paragraph 5 that a separate disposal of an interest acquired for no consideration must be deemed to take place as an actual disposal. I add that as question 7: How on earth does a deemed disposal take place as an actual disposal?</p>
	<p>It was the complications about deemed disposals, as much as the assembly of offices by Pooh-Bah, that made me choose "The Mikado" for examples and as a basis of studying Schedule 2. You will remember, Mr. Fitch, that it was the deemed disposal of Nanki-Poo that solved the problems in that play. Nanki-Poo had to die. The Mikado's will was law, and when the Mikado said "Let it a thing done", it was as good as done. One finds in Schedule 2 that a lot is left to assumptions of that sort and we have deemed disposal as much as the deemed disposal of Nanki-Poo.</p>
	<p>Let us assume that in one of his many capacities Pooh-Bah was a dealer in land. The Committee will remember my saying that he acquired Tower Green as part of his stock-in-trade. Let us assume that he acquired Tower Green East before 12th September 1974 and acquired Tower Green West after 12th September 1974. He sells them both. Apparently, by paragraph 7(2) he must treat the sale of Tower Green East as being at market value. He has to do that no matter what may be the total sale price, no matter what may be the value of Tower Green West, no matter what may be the value of selling the two together. So question 8 is: is this really so? Does he have to treat the sale of the property which he obtained before 12th September 1974 as stock-in-trade as being at market value? If so, if seems to me that this is pretty unfair.</p>
	<p>On the subject of applying formulae of that sort, when we come to part disposals and paragraph 10, we have the formula
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0879">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>577</span>
of all formulae. It is A + R1 + S=E which, incidentally, spells "Arise", though I do not know the significance of that. Having got that, it is—plus, minus
or multiplied by</p>
	<p>PD/PD + MR</p>
	<p>At this stage, I imagine that Pooh-Bah goes in search of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Three little maids who, all unwary,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Come from a ladies' seminary,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Freed from its genius tutelary,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Three little maids from school—"</p></blockquote>
because they are probably the only people who could recollect how to work out an equation of this sort—from three little maids take one away. But I doubt whether even the genius tutelary ever taught them how to apply a fraction to a number.</p>
	<p>I turned up the similar schedule in the previous legislation relating to capital gains tax and development gains tax, and nowhere did I find the word "apply". Does it mean that one applies pluses or minuses to each of the numbers, or that one multiplies them, and this applies again in paragraph 12 with the fraction</p>
	<p>CE — CR/CW?</p>
	<p>But if "apply" means multiply, and if the market value of the retained interest is pitched at a low figure, does it not mean that the realised development value on the part disposed is fictitiously high—that is, that Pooh-Bah will be paying development land tax on a gain which he has not made? I suppose that should be question 10 by now.</p>
	<p>Now may I pass to Part III, the leases part, taking the example that Pooh-Bah holds Castle Adamant on a long lease, that he paid Princess Ida a premium, and that he is paying her a ground rent. If I understand Part III correctly, his base current use value is the current use value of Castle Adamant, less the value of Princess Ida's right to receive the rent. That means that there must be a double valuation—the whole property, I suppose, or the whole leasehold, and then deduct the landlord's right to receive the rent.</p>
	<p>I do not know why we must have all these elaborations because, when Pooh-Bah comes to dispose of the property, he will want to know whether the best way to do so is by sub-letting or selling the reversion, to Pish-Tush. So I put the first of the questions arising from this as:
	<span class='label label-info column'>578</span>
does all Part III of Schedule 2 apply to all leases, whatever their length, except when it specifically mentions 50 years? Therefore, do we have to forget all that we learned under Clause 2 about the major interests? Or are they quite remote from Schedule 2?</p>
	<p>I asked why we needed all these elaborations of Part III. Let me put it this way—and to keep the numbering going it is question No. 12. Why cannot we just value the reversion and value the leasehold interest when we are dealing with leases? It seems that that could be expressed in paragraph 13 of Part III just like that and the whole of the rest of Part III would be unnecessary. If it is necessary to have it, the next question, No. 13, is to ask why Base C is not available when the lease has not more than 50 years to run. This is said rather baldly in a sub-paragraph and I can find no particular reason for it.</p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>I am sure that in the true Gilbertian style, Pooh-Bah will want to know whether one can have an assumed-part-deemed disposal or a part-assumed-deemed disposal or a deemed-part-assumed disposal. They all seem to arise out of Part III of Schedule 2, but I am not posing that as a question.</p>
	<p>I do not put it beyond Pooh-Bah to get out of all these difficulties—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. We have about 14 questions relating to Pooh-Bah, but where does he come in the Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I think one must allow the right hon. Member and indeed any hon. Member a certain amount of literary and musical flair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. Fitch, that it will not be musical flair. I shall spare the Committee singing Gilbert and Sullivan and I shall only quote. I find it helps a little in the extremely tedious debates we need to have on the technicalities of the Bill if they are leavened a little with examples which perhaps stick in the mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that Pooh-Bah would perhaps be able to get out of the difficulty because it will be remembered that he told
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0880">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>579</span>
Ko-Ko that, as Paymaster-General, he could so cook the accounts that as High Lord Auditor he would never discover the fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Actually we assume that he does not need to cook the accounts at all because Castle Adamant was burnt down last week, Pooh-Bah has received the insurance money, and paragraph 29 tells us what happened to the insurance money. Indeed, when Pooh-Bah received the insurance money it seemed to be as welcome to him as the flowers that bloom in the spring Tra la, until, of course, Her Majesty's Inspector of Taxes, dressed as one of the courtiers of the court of Titipu, said that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The flowers that bloom in the spring, Tra la,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Have nothing to do with the case."</p></blockquote>
They have of course, because this fire was a part disposal. The insurance money, let us assume, exceeded the current use value. Therefore, the consideration must be the current use value—heaven knows why, but we are told that it must be in paragraph 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Question No. 14 asks: "Is Pooh-Bah right?" Does this mean that no tax is payable because no development value has been realised? Yet it cannot be realised if we are treating the insurance money as the current use value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By this time Pooh-Bah was convinced that anything he might do with the property would be a crime and that, like:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The idiot who, in railway carriages, scribbles on window-panes,"</p></blockquote>
he was already suffering the punishment to fit the crime which was, in song to suffer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To ride on a buffer</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In Parliamentary trains."</p></blockquote>
In a fit of frustration and depression he started to dig his own grave on the land of Castle Bunthorne, which action—wait for it—was a project of material development. It was not only a project of material development on that particular area, but a project of material development, if this is an assembly, in respect of which he was deemed to re-acquire the two castles, one palace and Tower Green, plus the excess of base A over the net proceeds of the deemed part disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, instead of committing suicide in that form he chose the other way to end it:
	<span class='label label-info column'>580</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"Then he plunged himself into the billowy wave,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And an echo arose from the suicide's grave'—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Oh willow, titwillow, titwillow!'"</p></blockquote>
That prompts me to ask a question about paragraph 30, question 15.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a company distributes its assets in kind, why is that to be taken to be a disposal at market value? Why should not the distribution be ignored and the base for the shareholder be the company's acquisition of the property? This seems a simple application of the gift clause. I am sure we could simplify the whole business of Schedule 2 if the Minister would put his mind to it. Why do we have these 17 pages of very clever complications? It is solely because, in order to discover the realised development value upon which the development land tax will be payable, we have to discover the several factors of bases A, B and C, that is the cost and moment of acquisition, the expenditure on relevant improvements, the two current use values, the special addition, and the extra special addition. How much simpler it would all be if we had a simple gains tax—at a lower rate, of course—without any distinction between current use value gains and development value gains.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In concluding on Schedule 2 stand part—and I am sure Mr. Fitch, you will be glad to hear me say that—I can only say:
	<br><blockquote><p>A wandering minstrel I—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>A thing of shreds and patches,"</p></blockquote>
and I apologise if my catalogue is long, through every paragraph ranging.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although as a good Tory I could claim:
	<br><blockquote><p>"And I am right,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And you are right,</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>And all is right as right can be!"</p></blockquote>
I am left at the moment—albeit not politically—with the impression that Treasury Ministers and parliamentary draftsmen between them have achieved this time their object all sublime: to treat us like those billiard sharps
	<br><blockquote><p>"made to dwell—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>In a dungeon cell …"</p></blockquote>

	<span class='label label-info column'>581</span>
He referred to the courtiers who apparently will be able to understand all this. I should have thought that we were better off then that—we have mandarins who are far better than courtiers in understanding the complexities of this schedule. I will try to deal with all the points which he raised, but I hope he will forgive me if I do not go through them in the order in which he asked them. That, of course, is merely meant to confuse and make life more difficult for him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I should like to mention something in relation to Amendment No. 133, which arises in clause stand part. We dealt in this amendment with the deduction for costs incurred in employing engineers, consultants, public health inspectors and so on. Of course many of these expenses would have been expenses on relevant improvements. The expense of employing a planner, for instance, would obviously be reflected very often in the current use value or in the value of the property and would be deductible as an improvement or a relevant improvement. I do not want to give the impression that those expenses would never be deductible, leaving aside the point in relation to corporation tax. They would often, not always, be deductible in relation to relevant improvements or improvements. For that purpose, of course, there would have been no need to list them in the legislation. If they are improvements, they are reflected in the valuation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to some of the questions that the right hon. Gentleman asked. First, he gave an example of a purchaser buying different parcels of land, possibly in different areas, and he asked how all of Schedule 2 would apply to that situation. I should have thought that, although Schedule 2 is extremely complex—I must admit I have some difficulty in understanding it—paragraph 1(1) makes it reasonably clear because it deals with the situation where there is a disposal of an interest in land—which is referred to as "the relevant interest"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and the chargeable person did not acquire the whole of the rights which make up the relevant interest in a single transaction but acquired at different times two or more different interests … which together make up the relevant interest".</p></blockquote>
One looks at the interest which is being disposed of and then asks "Is that interest made up of one acquisition at one time,
	<span class='label label-info column'>582</span>
or is it made up of different acquisitions at different times?".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously, if one were to dispose of the Tower of London, or whatever example the right hon. Gentleman gave, that would be the one interest being disposed of and one would not take into account other interests that are acquired at other times. On the other hand, if one disposed of two or three interests together, each would be treated separately as a separate interest for the purposes of the cost of acquisition and computing the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I should have thought that in most cases it would not be too difficult to determine the relevant interest, because we are looking at the actual interest that has been disposed of in the conveyance or the contract and then asking "Is that interest made up of different interests acquired at different times?" If it is, the assembly rules apply and we take into account each separate cost of acquisition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My question was: Does all the land have to be geographically contiguous, or is it possible to have an assembly of land which is not necessarily a contiguous area of land? It is not defined.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I do not think that the contiguity of the land is the important point here. The important point is what is being disposed. If what is being disposed comes into the development land tax legislation, then we ask "Has all that been acquired at one time or has it been acquired at separate times?" Whether some of the land is contiguous with other land is not a relevant consideration. I should have thought that we were merely looking at different costs of acquisitions. Otherwise, the vendor, as the right hon. Gentleman appreciates, would be deprived possibly of the separate costs of acquisition because, having acquired separate lands and put them together, he might not get the separate base values in relation to the different parts of land he had acquired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then the right hon. Gentleman asked why the subparagraphs on page 78 did not seem to tie together. I cannot give a satisfactory answer to that as I think they do tie together. I accept entirely that the paragraph is extremely complicated, but the draftsman has attempted to make the subparagraphs tie together in an extremely difficult situation where different pieces of land are assembled for disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0882">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>583</span>
The right hon. Gentleman then mentioned paragraph 3. This really relates to Clause 10, as I said previously, which concerns gifts. He thought that Clause 10(6) did not tally with paragraph 3. I respectfully suggest that Clause 10(6) is a general subsection. One does not read paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 first, as it were, and then fit everything into Clause 10. Clause 10 deals generally with the situation where land is given and it may have nothing to do with assembled land. So Schedule 2 is not qualified in any way. I do not think that there is an anomaly here, but we could discuss it when we come to Clause 10(6) which is related to a different situation and applies to cases involving acquisition of leases, as the Explanatory Notes make clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On paragraph 4, the right hon. Member mentioned a gift of an improvement. He again said that Clause 10 does not apply to a gift of an improvement. That is absolutely right. Clause 10 applies only to a gift of an interest in land. A relevant improvement, of course, could be an interest in land in some cases. As regards the example the right hon. Member gave, it would not be an interest in land and Clause 10 would not apply. I am told that Clause 10(2)(	<i>b</i>) allows expenditure on improvements by the donor to be included in the donee's base value on a subsequent disposal. So, to that extent, the donee benefits from a gift because expenditure incurred by the donor is allowed. That makes sense within the legislation because the donee gets the cost of acquisition of the donor, and any relevant improvements are added and included in the tax computation of the donee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not logical that if the donee can include expenditure on improvements by the donor which are—as it were—a gift to him, he should include any given expenditure or improvements thereafter?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what given improvements after that would be. A gift is a gift.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might be by someone else, or even by the donor himself, who, having given the property, still
	<span class='label label-info column'>584</span>
wishes to benefit the donee. As I earlier suggested, he may have built a couple of bathrooms on the property but may not have charged the donee for them. If one can take into account gifts of improvements made before the donation, it is logical that one can take them into account afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would dispute that. I do not think that it is logical to bring it in afterwards. We are looking at a gift. If there have been relevant improvements prior to the gift, it is fair, right and logical that they should be included. But if after property has been given—and it could have been given years later—the donor installs a bathroom, or improves the property in some other way, it would be difficult to frame legislation to relate such expenditure to a specific gift. It is right and logical to apply it at the point of the gift and not later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member then went into the difficult area of joint tenants. I would not want to spend the Committee's time discussing joint tenancies although, as he well knows, on a joint tenancy there is a right to survivorship in that the property passes on death to the second joint tenant. The questions of joint tenants will come up again in relation to Clause 9 and devolution on death. No doubt it will crop up again throughout this legislation. I am not sure what point he was making in relation to joint tenants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman mentioned that we would probably return to joint tenants later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the valuation of the base values, I understand that one takes each part of the land—again, this makes sense within the assembly provision—and values it separately. One then adds it all up and reaches the most favourable basis for the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On paragraph 7, which deals with the stock-in-trade exemption, the right hon. Gentleman asked why the person who acquired land before 12th September 1974 had to take market value. Perhaps he will bear with me if I read to him a paragraph on that point which I hope will make it clear, or, at least will give him something to inquire further into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0883">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>585</span>
Paragraph 7, as the right hon. Gentleman correctly stated, deals with the case where an interest in land to which a stock-in-trade exemption attaches forms part of an assembly. Clause 16 deals with the stock-in-trade exemption and we shall come to it later. The amount of exemption is calculated by assuming the disposal of that interest as a separate entity at its market value—this is the point that the right hon. Gentleman was making—and using the relevant base of the assembly—that is, base A, base B or base C, as the case may be—as the relevant base of that interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be suggested—and perhaps this was the right hon. Gentleman's suggestion—that a different base should be allowed if it produces a higher base value. I am told that this is mistaken because the higher the base value the smaller the amount of the exemption. I shall amplify that point in a moment. When the disposal of the assembly is a deemed disposal it could happen that the amount of the exemption exceeds the actual realised development value. This could happen, for example, where the development does not extend to the whole of the assembled land, so the amount of the exemption could exceed the actual development value if the development was to only part of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 7 preserves the balance of the exemption for use on a subsequent disposal. If it did not do so, this balance would be lost because the separate parts of an assembly completely disappear following a deemed disposal and re-acquisition. So in effect the stock-in-trade exemption is preserved if all of it is not used up on a part disposal. It is like carrying forward a tax credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we get to the deemed disposal situation, the assembly comes to an end because all the bits of the assembly are deemed to have been sold together, and there is then one re-acquisition of the whole area. To preserve the stock-in-trade exemption which attached to the one piece of land—the pre-12th September 1974 land—paragraph 7 is necessary, otherwise there would be danger that the developer would lose part of the benefit of this exemption since he was unable to use it all at the point of the actual deemed disposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for allowing me to interject at this point. May I refer to Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>586</span>
No. 68, which is very badly drafted and which was not called. There was a point relating to the meaning of paragraph 7(4). The Minister has explained what it means, but I wonder whether the words achieve that. Paragraph 7(4)(	<i>a</i>) says that "the amount so ascertained"—as I understand it, that is the exemption:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be treated … as equal to the amount of that realised development value".</p></blockquote>
Paragraph 7(4)(	<i>b</i>) says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the amount of the excess shall be carried forward to a subsequent disposal".</p></blockquote>
The amendment tried to clarify whether this meant that the amount so ascertained by this exemption should be first set off against the amount of the development value and then any resulting excess should be carried forward. If that is what is meant, I wonder whether these words actually achieve it and whether if we had a slightly more accurate amendment it might have clarified it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. The amendment was not called and we were not able to discuss it. My advice is that paragraph 7 achieves the desired result of carrying forward the excess value to the post-deemed disposal situation. I shall look at the amendment again to see whether it would improve the drafting, but I seem to recollect deciding that the amendment was not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to one or two other questions that the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page)—asked. He asked why paragraph 6 talks about an actual deemed disposal rather than a deemed actual disposal. My advice is that the word "actual" is used in contrast to the "notional" disposal. We have not only actual deemed disposal but notional deemed disposal. It could be an actual deemed disposal. No doubt that will be clear to the right hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could it be a notional actual deemed disposal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it could be notional actual. I think the draftsman draws the line at using the words "notional actual" together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member then asked me whether Part III, which deals with leases applies to all leases. My advice is that it does. He then asked an important question about paragraph 29 which is concerned with insurance. He asked me
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0884">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>587</span>
what the paragraph achieved and its purpose. Paragraph 29 introduces a special rule where an insurance payment is received in respect of damage to or the loss of a building. That will not come as any surprise to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 3(2) this receipt constitutes a part disposal. We have discussed that matter at some length and there was considerable consternation on the Opposition Benches in case a person who received a sum of money in compensation would actually have to pay some tax on it. If the insurance money which is received and which comes into computation under Clause 3(2) as a part disposal, exceeds the current use value attributable to the disposal, found under Paragraph 12(1) of this schedule, the consideration for the part disposal is taken to be equal to the current use value and not the actual amount of the insurance payment. Without this provision it would have been possible for DLT to become payable where the insurance payment was related to the replacement cost of a building, which might be in excess of its current use value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> Could I ask whether, in the fourth line of paragraph 29, the words "capital sum" may be a little restricted in the effect of the paragraph. I throw that in. I do not ask for an answer now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will look at that. I do not know whether it was taken from the capital gains tax legislation. It may reflect that legislation, but I do not know.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>588</span>
Finally I come to liquidations. I was asked why a distribution by a company in liquidation was deemed to be of no value. It is no such thing. The answer to that is that a distribution or liquidation is not a gift by the liquidator to the shareholders. It is a payment reflecting the shareholders' interest in the company and the value of their shares. There does not seem to be any reason why it should be deemed to be a gift when it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is the same for capital gains tax. Again. where there is a liquidation the shareholder is deemed to have disposed of his shares for the value of the shares and the sum he receives in the liquidation. If the shares reflect development value, development land tax is payable. I do not think it would make any sense, either in fiscal legislation or in general law, to treat that as a gift, because it is a payment in satisfaction of shareholders' rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point of that question was that, although not strictly in law, there did not seem to be a transfer out of one person to another. It is from the company to the shareholders. I know that in law they are different entities but it was very much in the same ownership in passing the property over if it is distributed in kind. That is why I asked the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the right hon. Gentleman answered his own question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
