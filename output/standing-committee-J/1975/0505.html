	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) This section shall also apply to realised development value accruing to trustees of settled property (or property treated as such by section 29(4) below) as if for paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of subsection (1) above there were substituted the following:—

	<li>"(	<i>c</i>) at the time of the deemed disposal, the person entitled under the terms of the settlement either to the whole of the income derived from, or from the proceeds of sale of, the interest or to occupy the dwelling-house, intends to occupy the dwelling-house as his sole or main residence."'—[	<i>Mr. Michael Latham.</i>]</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that this we are discussing also the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 135, in page 23, line 27, at end insert:—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(6) This section shall also apply where the relevant interest is settled property held by the owner as trustee and an individual (in this subsection referred to as "the beneficiary") is entitled under the terms of the settlement either to occupy the land in which the relevant interest subsists or to the whole of the income derived from, or from the proceeds of sale of, that interest; and in applying this section in such a case—
	<ol>
	<li>in subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) the reference to the owner shall be deemed to include the settlor or testator (as the case may be) from whom the relevant interest devolved;</li>
	<li>in subsections (1)(	<i>c</i>), (3) and (4) references to the owner shall be construed as references to the beneficiary; and</li>
	<li>in subsection (2) references to "individual" shall be construed as including both the said settlor or testator and the said trustee and occupation by the beneficiary shall be treated as occupation by the individual as so construed.'</li></ol></p></blockquote></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>898</span>
	<p>No. 191, in page 23, line 27, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(6) Section 14(6) of this Act shall apply to the section as it applies to section 14.'</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it would be for the convenience of the Committee if I slightly amplified the remarks I was making at out last sitting, but only briefly, for reasons that I do not need to go into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill as drafted, one of the geteways for exemption for the building of a single house, is that, at the time of the deemed disposal, the owner, or an adult member of this family, as defined in subsections (3) or (4), intends to occupy it for himself or for themselves. Amendment No. 247 would extend this exemption to the beneficiary of a trust if he proposed to live in the property himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 135—Amendment No. 191 is consequential on Amendment No. 135—this Amendment is intended to introduce a similar exemption to that in respect of capital gains tax, where the property is owned by trustees in settlement but occupied by persons within the relevant classes which are those in subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The property may be owned by trustees of a settlement and they permit, say, the building of an additional dwelling house on the land. An example might occur in the case where a husband and wife have a child who is suffereing from incapacity, as well as other children who are not so affected. Let us suppose that that child is mentally or physically handicapped. To reserve the rights of that child, they may put the property into trust and continue to occupy that property for the remainder of their lives but ensure thereby that the rights of the handicapped child are preserved. In such circumstances, I would suggest it is unreasonable to deny relief to the trustees. That is the purpose of Amendment No. 135.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the points which the Minister made as we were concluding our discussions last time, about the difficulties of Barclays Bank Trust Co. Ltd. building individual houses. I understand that very well. I think the points which I have made have some force. I appreciate that they would occur only in relatively rare circumstances, but perhaps they could be looked at again between now and the next stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1052">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>899</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will make just a short reply. The hon. Gentleman is quite right. I assumed in my reply that we were dealing just with the case of the trustee building on building land, and carrying out the deemed disposal. In fact, as the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, we are also concerned here with the case involving a beneficiary, where the asset might be in a trust but the beneficiary is doing the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will not expect me to accept the amendment. I have some sympathy with what he said. Repeating what I said last time—once we get to the kind of situation we have in Clause 15, it is perfectly reasonable that we should get this kind of amendment and that people should seek to extend the exemption. Two worthy cases are not covered now by Clause 15, and the problem may lie in Clause 15 itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last time I gave an undertaking that we would look at Clause 15 to see whether we could not bring something forward which was possibly more logical and simpler, without opening the door for any large-scale tax avoidance. In view of that, I would have hoped that the hon. Member would not press his amendment. I have some sympathy with it, but if we look again at Clause 15 we may avoid these difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 328, in page 22, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1A) For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section an individual shall be deemed to own the relevant interest on 12th September 1974 if he acquired it subsequent to that date for no consideration from an individual who owned the interest within the meaning of paragraph (1)(	<i>a</i>) of this subsection on 12th September 1974 and who was at that time—
	<ol>
	<li>the individual's wife or husband;</li>
	<li>a lineal descendant of the individual or the wife or husband of the individual;</li>
	<li>an ancestor of the individual or the wife or husband of the individual;</li>
	<li>the brother or sister of the wife or husband of the brother or sister or any of their lineal descendants of the father or mother of the individual or the wife or husband of the individual'.</li></ol></p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>900</span>
I do not need to move the amendment at any length. It is on a very similar point and, as the Minister has already said that he is prepared to look at this matter again generally I shall simply leave the matter there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can respond similarly. Again, as the hon. Gentleman has said, this is an extension of the principle in the clause. We will look at the clause again unless he accepts that it might not be necessary. If we can bring something forward which is a bit more logical, it might not be necessary to consider this kind of situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 329, in page 23, line 27, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(6) For the purposes of this section a reference to the "owner" shall include a reference to the trustees of a settlement under which a person within subsection (3) above as amended by subsection (7) below is entitled to an interest in the income of the settlement or to occupy any part of the relevant interest.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(7) For the purposes of subsection (6) above, in subsection (3) the words "adult", "and has attained the age of eighteen at the time of the deemed disposal" were omitted'.</p></blockquote>
This is what I can best call a definition-type amendment. Under subsection (3) as drafted, the member of the family has to be an 18-year-old adult to claim the exemption. In the case of the beneficiaries of a discretionary trust there is no necessary reason why children should be excluded. This is the purpose of the amendment. Here again, we have already dealt with this matter in the last two amendments, and I shall not pursue the argument further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I think, the same points apply and I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman moved the amendment in the same terms as the previous amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Here we move, perhaps not to a more complex matter, but certainly a more significant matter—the vital clause, Clause 16, dealing with stock-in-trade for builders of their building land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the original proposals in the Community Land Act, land which was held as stock-in-trade on White Paper Day was intended to be exempted from the compulsory purchase duties in that Act and, indeed, by administrative concession the Government have said that that would be so. That has now in practice been extended to Royal Assent Day, because the Secretary of State for the Environment in a Written Answer on 27th January 1975 said:
	<br><blockquote><p>" Those who hold or need to acquire fresh land now will require some assurance that they will be able to develop such land. I shall look to local authorities to frame their proposals in such a way as to avoid delaying housebuilding and industrial development; and I shall not normally be prepared to entertain compulsory purchase orders under the scheme for land provided that good progress is being made with its development."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th January 1975; Vol. 885, c. 45.]</p></blockquote>
As I said, the Secretary of State said then and on several subsequent occasions
	<span class='label label-info column'>902</span>
that he did not want to see housebuilding interrupted or see builders deterred from acquiring land. The excepted development categories under the Community Land Act have been extended by administrative means to include land acquired by builders after White Paper day but before 12th November 1975, which was the date of the Royal Assent to the Community Land Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pray in aid here paragraph 42 of Community Land Act Circular No. 6—that is, Department of the Environment Circular 26/76, where paragraph 42 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Circular 1 indicated that this policy"—</p></blockquote>
which was the Secretary of State's which I have just quoted—
	<br><blockquote><p>"would apply particularly to cases where residential or industrial builders or developers bought land, or where planning permission for development was obtained, after 12th September 1974 but before Royal Assent on 12 November 1975. Such cases will normally be treated by the Secretary of State as if the development fell within the scope of classes 1 or 2 of the excepted development regulations, and he will not normally be prepared to entertain compulsory purchase orders except in circumstances where acquisition would be justified if the development constituted excepted development."</p></blockquote>
In Amendment No. 331 and the subsequent amendments, we seek to apply to development land tax the same exemption already conceded by the Government under the community land scheme. That would mean that builder's stock-in-trade should be protected not as of White Paper day, 12th September 1974, but as of the new date decided on by the Government for Community Land Act purposes, which is on the Royal Assent of that Act, namely, 12th November 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need stress again, as I have said it already on many occasions in Committee, how absolutely vital it is to ensure that builders have the forward confidence to build. There is nothing more likely to shatter that confidence than if local authorities which start acquiring their land stock-in-trade, are faced with substantial tax bills on that land stock-in-trade. The Government have already made an exemption for White Paper day land. As they have extended that exemption for Community Land Act purposes, we believe it right that they should do so for tax purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>903</span>
	<p>4.55 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), when moving his amendment, said that for the purposes of the community land scheme and certain purposes of compulsory purchase the date is 12th November 1975, in the sense that the Secretary of State said that in the case of land owned before that date the Community Land Act would not generally apply. The hon. Gentleman seeks to substitute that date for the present date of 12th September 1974 which is in the Bill. The date 12th September 1974 was the date of the White Paper which foreshadowed both the Community Land Act and this tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's arguments, on the face of it—I mean no disrespect by this, but exactly what I say—seem persuasive: we have a Community Land Act, on the one hand, where the date is now 12th November 1975; why not have the same date for the purposes of this tax; why have different dates? I may not be able to convince the hon. Gentleman, but perhaps I can give my reasons for not accepting his amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although to some extent the two parts of the legislation are complimentary and the intention is that at the end of the day this tax withers away and we move into the Community Land Act regime, I am sure hon. Members opposite will go along with me to some extent when I say that it may be some time before we reach that state. During the intervening period, however short or long it might be, this tax will operate and will operate as a tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So, although dealing with a complimentary piece of legislation, we are also dealing with a tax which we hope will be able to stand on its own feet as a tax that will help development and enable us to achieve some stability in this area. We are dealing, not with something that we have to follow slavishly, but with a tax that will stand on its own feet even if the Conservatives were to be returned to office and repeal the Community Land Act. We hope that they will see some virtue in this system of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one reason why some sort of distinction must be drawn between one piece of legislation and the other. Also, the White Paper announced a day from which the tax would operate. That is
	<span class='label label-info column'>904</span>
normal. Once that announcement was made, anyone acquiring land was on notice that as from that day he would be affected by certain taxation provisions. It would be wrong now to go back on that and extend the date another year or so, when many people may have acted on the basis of what we said in that White Paper, that the exemption and the tax would operate as from 12th September 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to have a certain amount of certainty in the area of taxation, because people will then carry out their commercial transactions on the basis of what is likely to happen. If we were to change it now, some people might, quite rightly, complain that we were changing the rules after we expressed our intentions clearly in respect of the date 12th September 1974. The two are not comparable, because it is easier to change one's intentions in relation to the Community Land Act, because it is not in operation yet and will not be fully in operation for some time. This is a tax which will operate fairly soon; and, in that case we should not go back on what was clearly said in relation to this tax, bearing in mind that people have acquired land and entered into the transaction on the basis of what we said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should also be remembered that, although the Community Land Act in many cases deals with the acquisition of land by local authorities, be it under compulsory purchase or otherwise, we are not concerned just with compulsory purchase in this legislation. We are concerned with a multitude of transactions where individuals may sell land and compulsory purchase may not come into it, whereas my right hon. Friend was referring to the compulsory purchase provisions of the Community Land Act. There again, we are dealing with identical situations but in a wider situation where there is not, or may not be, any compulsory purchase involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5. p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally—this argument may not appeal to the hon. Gentleman—if we were to accept this date, in logic we would have to change quite a few provisions in legislation, because it would not be right for these purposes to depart from the principle of 12th September 1974 as being the operative date, if that is the right way of describing it, in relation to many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1055">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>905</span>
exemptions—charities, for instance, which we have discussed. There, again, the date is 12th September 1974. This may not be a conclusive argument, but if we were to accept this date we should have to go right through the legislation, in all fairness, and change the other provisions in relation to 12th September 1974 to 12th November 1975. That would be unfair to people who acted on the basis that this tax and these exemptions would affect them as from 12th September 1974. We are dealing with a tax. It is different from the Community Land Act and in all fairness we should maintain the date which we chose in the White Paper and the date which is in the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply did not come as unexpected to those of us on this side of the Committee. I recognise that there is some logic in what he said. But I also think that the case presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) should be looked at in terms of its practical impact as well as the straight logic of a particular date for this and other purposes with reference to the Bill as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have emphasised on many occasions, the fundamental difference between the development land tax and the development gains tax is that, apart from being applied at a much higher rate, it applies to development by a company or others whose main function is that of building for development. On that score, we need to look at the practical experience of the building sector of the economy since September 1974. I do not necessarily say that that is the date in relation to the performance of the industry, but that is the date which we are discussing in connection with this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that, although housebuilding is now picking up to some extent, there is still a very severe recession in the building industry as a whole. This relates more particularly to the building of offices, factories, warehouses and shops. I say in the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) that we should never forget shops as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If land is held as stock-in-trade by a builder or developer and has been held during the past year or so, even though it may have been acquired after 12th September, there is a good practical case for considering whether it would not be wiser to exempt transactions relating to

such land from the development land tax. If it is to be imposed, all that it will do is to damage the cash flow or deter from development the operation of companies in that sphere. It would be possible to choose other dates—not necessarily 1975, perhaps later still—in this context in the light of the practical situation in the building industry, particularly in the development of property other than housing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to exclude housing, because housebuilders have still a great number of problems to cope with. I do not think that it could possibly be claimed, even from the most strongly partisan political point of view, that any socially offensive profits would be made at present from the building of houses, factories or offices. Therefore, in the light of practical experience I believe that this tax, like any other tax, should be subject to a little realism. The realism in this case is that it would be conducive to the public good and to the economic recovery of the country, to the provision of housing, and to the alleviation of the parlous position of the building industry, if transactions in land or development which would otherwise have given rise to the tax where such land is the stock-in-trade of businesses concerned with building or development should be exempted for the tax for a period beyond White Paper day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true, as the Minister has said, that paragraph 44 of the White Paper on Land—Cmnd. 5730—states clearly that the charge to tax would apply where an owner bought land after the date of the White Paper and then were to realise development value either on a further sale or on the carrying out of development thereafter. Since the Minister is representing the Treasury and since the Treasury is concerned with the economic situation in the country in general and, more particularly, with the way in which taxes affect the operation of various sectors of industry within our economy, I believe that there is a separate case for extending the date in the case of land held as stock in trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it would carry with it, by every avenue of logic, the necessity of changing the White Paper date for other purposes. We have put forward arguments in other cases, as the Minister mentioned—the case of charities is one—where we think the exemption should

	<span class='label label-info column'>907</span>
persist after 12th September 1974. But I do not believe that such cases are necessarily related to the possibility of extending exemption for land held as stock in trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have explained why I think this is the case. I feel that it would be helpful if, in the light of the continuing problems of the building and development sectors of the economy, the Government could reconsider whether on those grounds, which I think would be understood by other potential taxpayers of the development land tax, there should not properly</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 194, in page 23, line 35, leave out from 'trade' to end of line 39.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 140, in page 23, line 36, leave out paragraph (	<i>b</i>) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(	<i>b</i>) on that date planning permission authorising any development (in this section referred to as "authorised development") of the whole or any part of that land was either in force or is to be treated as having been in force by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 5 to this Act'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 194 seeks to delete paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of Clause 16(1). This paragraph at present restricts the exempted land to land with planning permission. Our amendment would substitute a new paragraph (	<i>b</i>), which would require that planning permission was either actually in force—in other words, the same as in the Bill—or would treat it as being in force by virtue of the provisions of Schedule 5.

At first sight, this amendment would appear to be unnecessary, in that Schedule 5 defines the circumstances in which planning permission is in force. But cross-references of this kind are helpful to practitioners, and Amendment</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As no other member of the Committee wishes to intervene, I simply say that although I was grateful to the Minister for the courtesy with which he replied to my amendment, I think this is an important matter and I intend to press it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>No. 140 would make it immediately clear that the Clause 16 exemptions are available on the basis of the call-in or appeal provisions set out in Schedule 5(1), or on the basis of outline planning permission, as defined in Schedule 5(2). The amendment is a clarifying amendment to help practitioners reading through the Bill, and in no way changes the policy of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) said that Amendments Nos. 194 and 140 should be read together, and together they seek to clarify the provisions of the Bill in relation to planning permission and stock-in-trade on 12th September 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From looking at the amendments at first sight, I confess that I was not immediately aware that that was the hon. Gentleman's intention. I thought that he was seeking to go further and to claim additional exemption. But, if the intention is to clarify the Bill—and it is not always possible to get provisions as clear as we would wish—I am happy to look at the drafting to see whether it is not clear and whether it can be made clearer for those who have to deal with these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendments were to be found to go further than that, I must make it clear also that I cannot accept them in that spirit. If they are merely to clarify the drafting to make clear that we are referring
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1057">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>909</span>
to Schedule 5, we shall certainly look at the drafting to see whether it needs to be clarified in the light of what the hon. Gentleman has said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested to hear the Minister's comments on these amendments and that he had anticipated the possibility that Amendment No. 194 might be a little more ambitious than had been explained by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). Therefore, it is right to take this opportunity to consider the merits of Amendment No. 194 on its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not repeat the comment I made on the previous amendment, when I was discussing the difficulties in which the building industry has found itself during the past year or two. But those comments as applied to Amendment No. 331 apply with greater force to Amendment No. 194.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who acquire land for development as part of their stock-in-trade often have to acquire such land without planning permission. It may be that the acquirer of such land is, or has been, the party which first saw the development possibilities of such land. It may that the vendor, who is perhaps a private individual, has not been able to obtain planning permission or does not want to be bothered with going through the procedures of planning application. Any company in the building or development trade which seeks to have a continuous flow of business must always be acquiring land for development and some of that land will not have planning permission at the time it is acquired. There may be good technical reasons for there being no planning permission, although it may be understood, or may have been understood some time ago when the land was acquired for this purpose, that it was likely to get the necessary planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the date 12th September 1974 is to apply—I am sorry that we were defeated on the last amendment—it makes it all the more important that companies should not find that the date of the White Paper chopped off their expectations in relation to their arithmetic on development in the future for land which they held at that time. Therefore, I think that there is a strong case—again I emphasise on practical
	<span class='label label-info column'>910</span>
grounds—for treating Amendment No. 194 in its own right. I cannot see how it could be regarded as any sort of loophole or avoidance of the general intention of the Bill because companies which are in the continuing business of building and property would be undertaking the acquisition of land for development at such future time as a very normal part of their everyday business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not see how the imminence of the White Paper, of which the practical and detailed contents can have been unknown, can reasonably be required to operate retrospectively to situations where a different tax regime applied. For that reason, I think that there is a strong case for treating Amendment No. 194 on its own and on its merits. I should be interested to hear some further elaboration from the Minister on the reasons which would have made him so hard-hearted had my hon. Friend sought to move the amendment in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) on this. There is not a split on this side of the Committee between this end of the Bench and the other, but there is a case for saying that, if it is stock-in-trade which is being held, and if it was held at a time before the trader had any idea about the present tax there is no reason to say that because a person did not go ahead with planning permission to develop the land—perhaps he was at that stage holding it as part of his land bank—and because he was not in the process of developing and had not got as far as getting planning permission, he should be subject to the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that it was sufficient to say "This is a trader. We have already in the Bill recognised that certain stock-in-trade should be exempt from the Bill." But the principle is that it is stock-in-trade and, once if has been proved that it is not just a casual owner taking advantage of a windfall and deciding that he will now go ahead and get planning permission and dispose of the property, I would have thought that that was sufficient. I cannot think that the Revenue will lose enormously over this, but, on the other hand, it will be of great encouragement to builders who have land as part of their land bank and who have decided that to get planning permission by 12th September is not the right
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1058">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>911</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister comments, it might be helpful to him if I make a few points in following my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) and my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart). I intended to deploy the arguments that they have just used at greater length on Amendments Nos. 341 and 342. I appreciated entirely that if one had taken Amendment No. 194 on its own it was strongly susceptible to the arguments which they have just put to the Committee and with which I entirely agree, as I shall try and indicate at a later stage, but since Amendment No. 140 has very properly been linked with it, it seemed to me that it was no longer susceptible on its own of that particular treatment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall let the Minister into a secret, which is that it is not entirely unknown for hon. Members to move amendments which they have not themselves drafted. It is not entirely unknown for the people outside the House who have drafted the amendment not always to indicate what it was they want by the amendments. In this case I decided to work it out for myself. I came to the conclusion, which I have already suggested to the Committee, that it greatly improved the drafting for the practitioners, and the Minister has very kindly indicated that he will look at this again on that basis. It may be that when we come to Amendment No. 341 we shall have something to say on the questions which my right hon. Friend and hon. Friend have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has been very frank and fair with the Committee. It is not entirely unknown for Ministers, and indeed Treasury Ministers, to read out briefs which they do not wholly understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 194, as has been recognised, goes much further by itself and seeks, as the hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) and the right hon. Gentleman for Crosby (Mr. Page) have said, to extend the exemption to stock in trade acquired before 12th September but
	<span class='label label-info column'>912</span>
which did not have planning permission on that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to enter into a complicated argument, but one could argue that this is not, and indeed it is not, a tax on stock in trade as such. This is a tax on a betterment value. The asset which is taxed, if it can be called an asset—I am using the word "asset" in a very loose sense—is the betterment element. If I, as a builder, had an asset before 12th September 1974, and I have it because I have planning permission, it is only fair and right that I should not have to pay tax on that if I had it before the tax was announced. If, however, I did not have that asset on 12th September 1974, but got it afterwards, and all I have if I do not have planning permission is a bit of land—if after 12th September 1974 I have acquired an asset in circumstances in which the tax is to operate—I suggest that is a slightly different situation. We are looking not at a tax on land as such, but at a tax on land with a betterment value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are saying here is that where the builder has land as his stock in trade with a betterment value on 12th September 1974 we shall not tax him, but where he does not acquire that asset, that betterment value, until after 12th September 1974 he comes within the regime of the legislation, because as from that date he was on notice—everybody knew that the tax would operate. I do not put that forward as a conclusive argument but merely to try to point out that we are concerned not just with stock in trade but with stock in trade that has acquired betterment value. That is why we think this is sensible and logical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be cases where it is felt to be unfair. Planning permission may not have been obtained for some reason. I accept that in those cases it might be unfair, but whenever we try to draw a line it is never exactly in the right place. Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen will know that where a planning permission has been refused before 12th September 1974 and then allowed afterwards under appeal, the stock in trade exemption will follow in that case. Also, where the application has been called in by the Secretary of State under Section 35 of the Town and Country Planning Act and the permission is subsequently granted, again exemption is given in that case. I accept that those are limited situations, but at least we have moved in the direction required by the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1059">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>913</span>
Opposition by including these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the general point, I am afraid that I cannot go along with hon. Gentlemen opposite, for the simple reason that we are concerned here with a tax on betterment. If the betterment was not there on 12th September 1974, we feel it would not be right to exclude it from taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful to us to have a further insight into the Government's thinking about this. There is an argument in some sort of sophistry that assets were acquired only after 12th September 1974; it achieved identity after that date by the granting of planning permissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although it may be possible to justify that argument by some sort of logic, it is not realistic when applied to certain circumstances. Again I emphasise that the development land tax is designed to replace a tax on betterment—the development gains tax—which did not apply to companies building houses for sale. Therefore, in the ordinary course of their business up to 12th September 1974 they acquired land with some prospect of planning permission and had no reason to think, as this was their stock-in-trade, that it would suddenly be subject to an axe on that date if planning permission had not been applied for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to pre-empt the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), or discourage him, if I deal with some practical examples when we come to the later amendments. Although it is possible to make a logical case, as the Minister has, it is tortuous logic which goes against the facts of the situation in the industries we are discussing. We should not leave the comments on Amendment No. 194 at this stage without commenting on what the Minister said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall be returning to this shortly, but at this stage I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 332, in page 23, line 42, after 'be', insert 'or would have been'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 333, in page 23, line 44, after 'attributable', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or deemed to be attributable'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 334, in page 23, line 45, leave out 'realised'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These are important amendments. I hope that the Government will be able to make a concession on them or, if they do not accept the amendments, make it clear that they accept the spirit behind them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of Amendment No. 332 is to clarify the fact that it is the value attributable to the White Paper day consent that is exempt and that, if the consent is changed, either because of the need to substitute a higher density consent or because the original consent is time-expired, the value created by the original White Paper day consent will remain exempt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that in the negotiations which took place the Revenue indicated that that is what it intends, but I believe it should be made clear in the clause. I say this as a builder, because it is a regular procedure for a builder to take over a piece of land with consent, having bought it from a land vendor or from another builder, which he wishes to change because the consent is either of the wrong density or layout, or because the planners have indicated that they are not satisfied with the consent that they previously gave and are prepared to consider another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That happens all the time and ordinarily can be negotiated without too much trouble between the planner and the builder who bought the land with consent. But nobody will go to the planners to vary their consent if they are likely to lose the stock in trade exemption under Clause 16 and accrue development land tax as a result because they are seeking a new consent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quite understand that this is in accordance with Government policy. I do not have the book with me, but I recall a circular from the Department of the Environment a year or so ago, that mentioned the desirability of local authorities giving consents at higher densities for small infilling schemes, and the need to be prepared to treat such proposals sympathetically.

	<span class='label label-info column'>915</span>
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am right in my recollection—and I am fairly sure that I am—it is all the more important that this should be firmly on the record. I stress to the Minister that this procedure of attempting to vary consents happens all the time in the building industry, usually with good will on both sides between the industry and the planners. However, that will not happen if White Paper day exemption is to be lost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 333 and 334 deal with the same point. There might not be an actual realisation of the development value, so the word "realised", which is in Clause 16(2) at the moment, would be inappropriate in that context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will be able to grant a concession on this matter, because it is of great importance to the building industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman moved and discussed Amendment No. 332, and then he dealt with Amendments Nos. 333 and 334 together.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that Amendment No. 332 dealt with the situation where consents are varied after White Paper day. There was some concern that the variation of consent might lead to a loss of the stock-in-trade exemption. He has received representations about this and is concerned that it should be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was not aware that representations had been made, although I shall make inquiries again. If they have not been made, we shall consider this point seriously, because if exemption is lost for this reason there could be considerable difficulty and damage to the building industry. I was not aware of any representations, but now that he has made the point I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall look into it. I cannot say that we shall accept the amendment, because I am not certain of the extent of the problem, but I take it from what he says that there is a problem, and we shall look at it and check whether representations were in fact received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Amendments Nos. 333 and 334, as far as the hon. Gentleman explained them. He takes exception to "realised development value", because in many cases, as he says, there will not be a realised development value. I can only say that
	<span class='label label-info column'>916</span>
"realised development value" is a term used in the legislation. In other parts of the Bill it covers both realised development value and development value which may not be realised. In other words, it relates to a hypothetical situation. We have certain types of hypothetical situations—deemed disposals, for instance, are hypothetical situations. We talk about realised development value in relation to deemed disposals, though of course there will not be actual development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we dropped "realised" here, we would have to go through the Bill and drop it in every case where there was a hypothetical development value. I do not think that that would be practicable. I shall look at the drafting and the meaning of "realised development value", to see whether we can make it any clearer, but I doubt whether this will be possible. People who study legislation will appreciate that it is a shorthand phrase to cover, in some cases, hypothetical situations, but it does not mean that tax will be payable if tax does not have to be paid. It is merely a drafting phrase to cover two situations—one where there is a realised development value, and another where the Bill deems a realisation to take place. If the Bill deems a realisation, the Bill has to deem a realised development value. However, this does not mean that we tax something that should not be taxed otherwise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be perfectly fair with the hon. Gentleman. He did not discuss Amendment No. 341, to which we may come back on Schedule 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that amendment is selected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the Committee. We shall deal with that amendment on Schedule 5, because that deals with certain cases of refusal of planning permission before 12th November 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that covers the hon. Gentleman's point. We shall certainly look at Amendment No. 332. In regard to the point on realised development value, I think that there is no problem. It is a shorthand phrase, and it does not mean that tax will be imposed where it should not be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of the difficulties of this Bill is to know whether when one comes across a particular group of words
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1061">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>917</span>
they are being used in a technical sense. It might be helpful, where one has a phrase such as "realised development value", to give it the designation RDV when it is used as a technical term. If there were a glossary of such terms, anyone using the Bill would become familiar with these terms, and a "project of material development" could be PMD and so on. One would automatically be put on notice that one was considering a technical definition, and not the normal English meaning of the words. Although they sometimes coincide, as we go through the Bill we find more and more instances where "realised" means "deemed to have been realised" and so on. The words do not have the meaning which they appear to have when one reads them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister for what he said about the main substantive amendment, No. 332. I have reason to believe that this point has been raised by the House Builders' Federation with the Revenue, but there is no reason why the Minister should know every in and out of all the negotiations that have taken place. He is obviously much too busy for that. I am grateful to him for offering to look at the matter again, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 195, in page 24, line 26, at end insert 'section 20'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 16(3), where land is given to someone for nothing and DLT is due, the donor or stock in trade exemption is passed on to the new owner. The same goes for a situation where part of a piece of land is disposed of and relief is available in accordance with paragraph 7 of Schedule 2, as we have already discussed in this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of Amendment No. 195 is to bring in transfers between companies as well, by linking Clause 20 of the Bill to it. Under Clause 20(1), inter-group transfers are generally held to be at nil value and therefore attract nil DLT. By this amendment, if there were some DLT due—because the transfer came within the exceptions to Clause 20, which are set out in subsection (2)—the Clause 16 relief will apply if it is appropriate for it to do so, that is, if the land had been
	<span class='label label-info column'>918</span>
stock in trade on White Paper day. That is the purpose of Amendment No. 195 as we see it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think this a matter of reasonable importance, though it is not likely to occur very often. I can understand that Clause 20, about which I shall talk later, is intended purely to avoid land pushing to and fro between individual partners, which is an avoidance device. The circumstances which I have described are perfectly reasonable, and there is no reason why this amendment should not be added.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may be allowed to read my brief, which might reassure the hon. Gentleman. It starts off "Resist as unnecessary". The amendment seeks to ensure that the stock in trade exemption is not lost as a result of a disposal within a group of companies. The amendment is unnecessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Clause 20(1), a disposal of an interest in land by one member of a group to another is treated for the purposes of the Bill as being made for no consideration. Subsection (3) of Clause 16—this is where the let-out occurs—allows the stock-in-trade exemption to run on when there is a disposal for no consideration, provided the person making the disposal qualifies for the exemption. Accordingly, the exemption will be preserved following an intra-group transfer. So we are looking at Clause 20(1) and Clause 16(3) which, put together, ensure that if there is a transfer within the group, if the transferor has the exemption, the exemption continues within the group.

It is true that Clause 16(3) is drafted in terms of "donee" and "donor", which may look a little odd in the context of disposals within a group, but those terms, as is clear from the subsection, are simply shorthand to describe those who acquire and dispose for no consideration, and this is apt to cover disposals within a group. The draftsman could have said transferor or transferee, I suppose, but the term "donor" in itself imports a gift, and a gift is something that is made without consideration. It may not be a gift within the group necessarily, although one could argue that it might be a gift within the group. The main point is that the interaction of Clauses 20(1) and 16(3) ensures that the amendment is not necessary and that the relief would be allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that it is not necessary if one plods through this—perhaps I should say if one works it out logically—in this way, but it is one of those cases where not only we on the Committee but also those outside have failed to appreciate the kind of logic that the Minister put forward. If it does no harm to the Bill and helps us to understand it, I should have thought that from a drafting point of view it would be wise to include it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It really is difficult to think of the word "donee" applying to a transfer as between companies within a group. In those circumstances, I think that it would make it plain and help the reader—unless one had a little glossary at the end saying "for 'donee' please read 'members of a group of companies'"—to have this small addition. It may be unnecessary from the point of view of the person who knows absolutely every line, every word every detail of the Bill, but it certainly is not unnecessary for those who have to apply it in practice and therefore have to try to understand the Bill pretty quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that in this case the Minister will say that although it is not necessary it should be put in for clarity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With great respect to the Minister, I am not sure that it is entirely unnecessary. His brief dealt solely with Clause 20(1). My own notes, every word of which I wrote myself although I did not draft the amendment, point out that under Clause 20(2) there are specific cases of inter-group transfer which would not be treated as being at a nil disposal and where development land tax might very well be payable. I was making the point that, in those circumstances, if they attracted the White Paper day stock-in-trade relief under Clause 16, it was perfectly reasonable that that should be done for inter-group transfers of White Paper day land, whereas it might not necessarily be reasonable that it should be done for non-White Paper day land with which Clause 20 is concerned as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With respect, I think that the Minister's advisers have anticipated one point that I was likely to make, but not the other. I wonder whether he would be prepared to think about that again. He may have to think about it for some time, as I see that some scribbling is going on. Perhaps it would be best if I left the matter there for the meantime, unless he wishes to
	<span class='label label-info column'>920</span>
intervene, so that we can come back to it again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 208, in page 24, line 41, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>' (5) Subsection 4 above also applies to the transfer of a business to a company in circumstances where the provisions of paragraph 15(1) of the 19th Schedule to the Finance Act 1969 are satisfied as if references to the deceased were references to the person or persons carrying on the business and references to the personal representatives were references to the company to which the business is transferred'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose of the amendment is to allow the stock in trade relief for nil value transfers where a person who is not himself a company but is trading personally transfers the assets to a company. We have attempted to do this by reference to paragraph 15(1) of Schedule 19 to the Finance Act 1969. I have here the Library's copy, which it tries to keep up to date by crossing out words repealed by later Acts, so I shall quote it as I understand it reads now:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This paragraph shall apply for the purposes of Part III of the Finance Act 1965…where a person who is not a company transfers to a company a business as a going concern, together with the whole assets of the business, or together with the whole of those assets other than cash, and the business is so transferred wholly or partly in exchange for shares issued by the company to the person transferring the business.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Any shares so received by the transferor in exchange for the business are referred to below as 'the new assets'."</p></blockquote>
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The situation envisaged in the amendment occurs frequently in the building industry. Many traders are sole traders, and they will often sell their land or sell the whole business to a company. In those circumstances, the stock in trade relief for nil value transfers should be available to them. This is a perfectly reasonable extension of the relief given by Schedule 19 to the Finance Act 1967. I do not think it will make a significant difference to the Revenue, and I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seeks by the amendment to have relief for the transfer of stock in trade by a sole trader or by a partnership to a company
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1063">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>921</span>
where he transfers the business to a company in return for shares. He is dealing with a case where the stock in trade relief would not otherwise be available. As the hon. Gentleman says, this is a fairly common situation when people decide to incorporate their businesses. There is some relief in capital gains tax legislation and other tax legislation when assets are transferred from an individual partnership business to a company business in return for shares.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's amendment. The difficulty is to introduce exemptions of this kind which create a considerable amount of complexity. It has done so in the capital gains tax legislation where these provisions are extremely complex, and they would be even more complex in this type of situation. However, I see the force of his argument and, without giving any commitment, because it might be difficult to overcome the complexity, I shall reconsider the matter. If we can do something about it, we shall do so on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must reserve my position to this extent, that we are entering a complex and difficult area. It may not be as simple as hon. Gentlemen think to frame the kind of provision required. However, I have some sympathy with what has been said, and if the hon. Gentleman were to consider withdrawing the amendment, I should be prepared to look at the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for what he said and for his sympathy for the principle embodied in the amendment. I think it is extremely important. It would be most hard on a sole trader or partnership if, when converted into a company, that trader or partnership lost the relief under Clause 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall return to this matter in more general terms in the new clauses, because we have tabled a new clause for this kind of thing to apply not merely in order to save the relief under Clause 16, but in other cases. Would it be possible for the Minister, between now and the debate on the new clauses, to consider the matter and give us his opinion on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I always fear that we shall deal with important matters such as this late at night on Report, and in the rush dispose of them in a short time. This is one of the major traders' points which affects those
	<span class='label label-info column'>922</span>
in business, and I hope that the Minister will be able to let us know something more about it before we reach the new clauses in a week or so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am prepared to give the right hon.

I regret to say that, probably due to my horrible manuscript writing, a word has been left out of the amendment. It should start with "or as chargeable". I am sure it will not confuse either my hon.

	<br><blockquote><p>'or as chargeable under section 19 of the Finance Act 1965 as amended by section 238 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970'.</p></blockquote>
I do not think that we shall find it necessary to press this amendment to a Division, so it should not distress anyone too much to accept the manuscript amendment for the purposes of our discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (6) as at present drafted, land attracts the stock in trade exemption of the clause if, had it been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1064">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>923</span>
sold on White Paper day, it would have been treated as a business deal, that is, not solely a one off transaction of land by an individual vendor subject to Schedule D. We seek to clarify the point in the way in which the amendment explains. Section 19 of the Finance Act 1965 is the declaratory section for the purposes of capital gains tax, and subsection (2) makes it clear that companies are not to be subject to it. Section 238 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 is the declaratory section for the purposes of corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment attempts to make it clear that the taxation will be of a corporation tax nature, because we are here dealing not with deals by sole traders but with stock in trade exemptions of land held by firms on White Paper day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) for pointing out the lack of the word "or". It makes the amendment somewhat clearer, but I am still not entirely sure that I understand exactly what the hon. Gentleman wishes. Perhaps if I develop my argument, he will be able to enlighten me further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the exemption stands, it is for stock in trade, which is a term of art in most cases, and the exemption, of course, is meant for builders and, I suppose, other people who hold land as stock in trade in order to assist them in their business ventures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, by seeking to include and insert
	<br><blockquote><p>"or as chargeable under section 19 of the Finance Act 1965",</p></blockquote>
—I take it that we can ignore the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"section 238 of the Incomes and Corporations Taxes Act"—</p></blockquote>
the amendment seeks to extend the exemption to a capital asset, and that capital asset would presumably be charged at corporation tax rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in quoting Section 19 of the Finance Act 1965, which is concerned with capital assets—exemption is sought for those kinds of assets—we are moving outside the area of the builder. The builder may hold land as a capital asset in some circumstances, but that is not the kind of land to which we wish to give exemption. We wish to give exemption to his trading
	<span class='label label-info column'>924</span>
land—if that is the right description—his stock in trade. I do not see any justification for extending the exemption to a capital asset, which I think is what would happen if the amendment were accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) intervenes, let me hasten to assure him that I am not about to take a certain course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be of assistance to the Committee if I give an example of the kind of thing envisaged by the amendment. We appreciate that the amendment is basically intended to deal with builders' stock in trade. The clause is basically intended to deal with this, which is obviously satisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we have in mind is an industrialist, say, who had a piece of land on White Paper day which he had intended to extend as part of his factory, supposing he already had a factory. There may well be reliefs in other parts of the Bill, but it seems to us to be perfectly reasonable that the relief should be extended in these circumstances where the man's main business is not building, and therefore as I understand it he would not be covered by the Clause 16 exemption in its present form but where it is something to do with land and where he is going to put it to a useful and gainful purpose. Perhaps that slight elaboration of the amendment will enable our discussion to proceed more profitably.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I only want to inform the Minister and the Committee that this is a problem which was put before us by the Confederation of British Industry which would like to know from our discussions here whether the stock in trade exemption would extend, not only to land which will eventually be sold as part of the trading asset, but also to land and property used within the trade—the Minister's phrase was a capital asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may well be cases in which the company that is trading is not actually trading in development of land and buildings but holds land for the purpose of building for its own trade business industrial purposes. The actual process of development in that case differs very little from the process of development by the builder who is developing the land in order to sell it within his trade. Here we are
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1065">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>925</span>
considering the trader who is developing the land for the purpose of his business. Although he is not going to sell that piece of land as he sells goods over the shop counter, or whatever it may be, he is using it within his trade in just the same way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The position was put to us, as I say, by the Confederation of British Industry in this form in order to clarify that the exemption would be given to an asset of that sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand fully the purpose of the amendment. We could not go along with it, for the reasons I have given. The CBI is concerned about assets which are not stock in trade as commonly understood either by accountants or taxation lawyers. But the exemption is meant to cover purely that kind of situation. It is not meant to cover the situation where, say, a motor car company has a factory and produces motor cars. That factory's stock in trade are the motor cars and the factory is a capital asset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exemption was not intended to cover that kind of situation although, of course, we come later in the Bill to the example which the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) gave of the industrialist developing and extending—he would come within the later exemption of an industrialist developing for his own use but only for industrial purposes—whereas the amendment is in relation to commercial developments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I want to make it absolutely clear that that kind of case is not covered by this stock in trade exemption, because those assets are not stock in trade. If we were to accept the amendment, it would bring in all capital assets whether they be factories hotels, blocks of flats or whatever they might be. All capital assets would be brought in—assets that are held as capital assets for investment purposes to assist a business, but not stock in trade of the business. For that reason, I could no accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to confess that any guidance the CBI may have produced on this matter did not find its way to me, so I had to try to work out what I thought the amendment meant. As there was a word missing, it made it rather difficult. When I was preparing my thoughts in the Library last night I had to spend some considerable time on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>926</span>
amendment before making what I fear was a very bad case in my opening speech. I beg leave to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 248, in Clause 16, page 25, line 18, after 'contract',insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(including one which is conditional on the exercise of an option)'.</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment, although it deals with an important matter. Under draft Clause 13 of the original White Paper on development land tax published last August, specific reference was made to option land being included within the stock in trade exemption. This was particularly done under draft Clause 13(3)(	<i>a</i>) which specifically mentioned an option to acquire an interest in that land being an option which was exercised for the disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, that stipulation in the draft White Paper is no longer the case. I do not believe that there is any problem where the land which is the subject of the option already had White Paper day consent. In such circumstances, it would clearly be an interest in land on White Paper day with planning permission, as options are effectively defined as an interest in land under Clause 8(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, most options are not for land with consent at all. They are, in effect, first refusal to the person who is holding the option once consent has been obtained. For example, the normal procedure is that the builder goes to the farmer and says "I would like to buy your land, but only if planning consent is obtained." The farmer says "All right, give me £500"—or whatever the sum may be—"and if consent is obtained you have first refusal to buy the land." That is what the option means, and there is usually a time limit on the option as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such circumstances, where land without consent is concerned the possession of an option by a builder on White Paper day will be of no relevance to him for Clause 16 purposes, since any development value realised by the option will be grouped with the general liability for tax under Clause 8 aggregations with which we have already dealt. However, under Clause 44(2)(	<i>a</i>) conditional contracts and options
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1066">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>927</span>
are virtually equated. I will refer specifically to those, Mr. Crawshaw; although they are further on in the Bill, they are directly germane to this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44(2)(	<i>a</i>) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the contract is conditional (and, in particular, if it is conditional on the exercise of an option"—</p></blockquote>
which is, of course, the basis of the amendment. But this equation between option and conditional contract in Clause 16 which we are discussing is not so. Therefore, if the Government want to carry out the original intentions of draft Clause 13 of the White Paper they should accept Amendment No. 248. If they do not, I can only assume that they have gone back on the position which they outlined at White Paper day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no problem with regard to land in respect of which the builder may hold an option on White Paper day and which already had consent: clearly, that is covered. But that is not the normal procedure: one does not normally have options on land with consent; one has options on land without consent in order to try and get the consent. It seems to me that that situation was covered in the White Paper and it is not covered now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have made quite clear what I am seeking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has moved an important amendment. I hope that when I sit down he will feel that it is unnecessary, because we have not gone back on what we suggested. I am not absolutely certain whether this will satisfy him, but perhaps he will bear with me while I read out a short piece that I had prepared on this point when we dealt with Clause 8. We touched upon this point in Clause 8(4). Perhaps I can give an example which might set his mind at rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, may I make it quite clear that the Bill deals with options in the same way as it deals with conditional contracts, and in our opinion that is not a problem. Where land is acquired under a conditional contract entered into before 12th September 1974, it is treated as having been held on that date even if acquired after that date. The amendment seeks to deal with options in the same way as conditional contracts, but I am advised that this is unnecessary because the Bill produces a similar result by another route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>928</span>
An option is, for development land tax purposes, an interest in land, and if it is acquired before 12th September 1974 it will be held at that date. If the option has been exercised after 12th September 1974, Clause 8(4) ensures that it lives on as a separate "part" of an assembly consisting of the option and the interest in land acquired under it. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 ensures that any stock in trade exemption attaching to a "part" of an assembly is preserved for use on a subsequent disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The value of the exemption in these circumstances is not confined to the value of the interest conferred by the option at the time it was granted. It will reflect any growth in the value of the option as the result, for example, of the grant of planning permission before it was exercised. The point I want to stress is that the value attaching to the option will not just be whatever was given for it when it was granted. That would be the case only if the option was to buy the land for its full development value. In that case, the developer will have no liability to pay anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More usually, and this is the type of case I had in mind, the option will be to buy at a price rather less than the land would be expected to command when the option has been granted. It follows that when permission is granted the option becomes a thing of value, commanding a price on the market corresponding to the difference between the price fixed by the option and the full market value of the land. In other words, the increase in value conferred by the permission is attached to the option. Clause 16 relief worked out for the option as I have described will, in turn, reflect that increase, but it may help if I give a simple example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose a builder pays £5,000 in 1972 for an option to buy five acres of building land for £50,000. Planning permission is given by 12th September 1974 and in, say, October 1974 he exercises the option. In 1976, after the development land tax appointed day, he starts a project of development. The market value of the land with the right to carry out the development now becomes £100,000. Ignoring the stock relief provisions, he would be realising £45,000 development value, that is £100,000—the value of the land at the time of commencement of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1067">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>929</span>
material development—less his total acquisition cost of £55,000—£5,000 for the option and £50,000 for the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking at the option, if it had continued to exist it would have been worth £50,000 in the market, because it gave the right to buy land worth £100,000 for only £50,000. He paid £5,000 for the option, but when he started to develop the land and DLT applied, the land was worth £100,000. That option to buy the land for £50,000 was to buy land which is now worth £100,000. The option is now worth £50,000—possibly a little less—but the option is worth a lot more than what he paid for it because he now has the option on an asset which is worth more than originally. The option cost £5,000, so the development value would be £45,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The measure of the stock relief, therefore, would be the £45,000, and it would extinguish the whole charge on the development. In other words, stock relief attaches to the increased value of the option and is not related to the original value of the option when the value of the option might have been a lot less than it is when the land is being developed, because originally the value of the option related to a lower value of the land but the land, when developed, may be worth a lot more. The option in those circumstances might be worth more, despite the fact that the option is exercised after White Paper day. The stock relief still relates and is given against the later value of the option at the date of exercise, and not the value of the option at the date of grant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry if that is complicated. I tried to read it out in order to give right hon. and hon. Gentlemen and anyone concerned about these matters the chance to study it. We can come back to it if it does not seem clear. We have tried to maintain the stock relief exemption, and maintain it against the greater value of the option when it is exercised, instead of restricting it to the lesser value of the option when the option was acquired. The lesser value will reflect the lesser value of the land, and the greater value will reflect the greater value of the land when development takes place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what I have said is reasonably clear, but I shall understand if hon. Gentlemen say that it is not, and we can come back to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>930</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that we have got back to Schedule 2—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So am I.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—where we dealt with the mandarins of Middlesbrough in their Palace of Titipu. This time I think we have got the magicians of Middlesbrough. If I may humbly say so, it was a magnificent explanation, which I think I may say that all Opposition members of the Committee were able to follow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key to it—is it not?—is that the option does not merge, but carries on as a separate interest in land. That is the answer to a matter which I was pressing on the Minister when we were dealing with options, asking why do we not just say that it merges. Obviously, that is one of the reasons that it does not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that anyone who has to deal with options and is able to read what the Minister has said will understand it. Whether we shall be able to pick holes in it when we read it in the OFFICIAL REPORT, I do not know. I do not think so. I was very happy with the explanation, and I am grateful to the Minister for giving it. I hope that my hon. Friend was, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like my right hon. Friend, clearly, I want to think about the matter and take advice. But we are grateful to the Minister for the full statement he has given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were two other points which I think I should deal with—first, the White Paper to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I am told that the drafting of the White Paper version of what is now Clause 16 was criticised by several bodies. The removal of what was subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) was part of a general tidying up of the treatment of options. As explained, it does not take away any Clause 16 relief. In fact, if there is a difference between Clause 16 and the White Paper, it is a drafting and tidying-up matter, not a denial of relief.

Secondly, the hon. Gentleman referred to Clause 44(2)(	<i>a</i>), and said that he did not see how it tied in with Clause 16. In fact, Clause 44 is slightly different in approach. If follows the capital gains tax provision, which treats options and conditional contracts in a certain way. It is different from Clause 16, and does not apply to the

	<span class='label label-info column'>931</span>
Clause 16 situation. So the hon. Gentleman need not worry about Clause 44(2)(	<i>a</i>), because it is a general provision, and does not in any way affect what I said in relation to Clause 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister is now in a position to comment on the secondary point that I raised on Amendment No. 195, which I deliberately left in the air to allow time for his advisers to reflect on it. I said that under Clause 20, there are some people whose inter-group transactions will not be treated as being at nil value. It was to them that I was attempting to attach stock in trade relief by the amendment which I moved earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps before the Minister answers, I should like to make one further basic observation. Clause 16 is a very important clause. In many ways, it is the most important clause in the Bill, other than the rate of tax itself, because it concerns the stock in trade exemption. Even though I have criticised points of detail throughout these proceedings, it would be churlish not to say that we welcome this clause and that it will be of considerable advantage to many builders. Indeed, had it not been in the Bill, it would have been disastrous for their businesses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the course of our discussion of this clause my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has moved a number of amendments some of which, he said, were for the clarification of the meaning of the clause or, alternatively, to pinpoint the cross-referencing aspects of the provisions. I hope that when the Minister and his advisers reconsider the amendments, or the wording in general, of this clause they will not necessarily out of hand "resist", "reject", or whatever is written at the top of the page, all amendments because after a great deal of research it can be proved that they are not strictly necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>932</span>
The Bill includes a number of phrases which one could perhaps omit and the Bill would not thereby lose its purity. However, I should like to comment upon Amendment No. 195 by way of illustration. My hon. Friend moves his amendments with such speed and efficiency that I had not realised we were leaving Amendment No. 195 before I could put this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In referring to whether, under subsection (3) there should be a reference to Section 20 which deals with groups of companies, the Minister said that this will be reconsidered. One point which occurs to me is the difficulty of deciding whether one form of words embraces a technical definition which is not expressed in the same but a similar form of words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, lines 16, 17 and 18 on page 24 state—
	<br><blockquote><p>" In any case where—
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) a person (in this subsection referred to as "the donee") acquires an interest in land for no consideration…"</p></blockquote></p></blockquote>
The relevant phrase in Section 20, which the Minister used to justify his comments on Amendment No. 195, was that
	<br><blockquote><p>"every disposal of an interest in land…by a member of a group of companies to another member of the group shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as a disposal (and acquisition) for which no consideration is given."</p></blockquote>
That is not the same as referring to a person who acquires an interest in land for no consideration. I emphasise this point because later in Section 20 there is a reference to something which is described as being "in fact" a disposal for which no consideration is given. There is the problem of knowing whether a general phrase automatically includes all the technical implications of a slightly different phrase used in a technical sense. When this point is looked at, I hope that will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest that lines 17 and 18 might read: "in any case where a person acquires or is treated as acquiring an interest in land for no consideration". Something of that effect might deal with my point, but it has a wider significance than the detail I have mentioned.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall certainly look at the points which the hon. Gentleman has made when we look again at the clauses. We look at all the clauses in the light of what is said in Committee.

The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) raised a question about the effect of Clause 20(2), suggesting that some cases may not come within subsection (1), and asking why therefore they should be denied inter-group relief. I do not wish to evade his question, but the best way to deal with it is for us to consider again the point, he made and I shall answer him when we come to Clause 20(2). That would be better than not getting it right at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'any planning permission granted before or after that date either originally by planning authority or on an appeal under the appeals provision shall be treated for the purposes of the principal section as being in force on that date if it was so granted on an application made before that date'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we shall take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 119, in page 101, line 30, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'in respect of a planning application made on or before 12th July 1974'.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>No. 172, in page 101, line 30, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'in respect of a planning application made on or before that date'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 141 is a very radical amendment. It would virtually cut out the whole of Schedule 5 and would define a planning permission in force on 12th September 1974 as being one which had been granted before or after that date either originally by the planning authority or on appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have thought carefully about this amendment and compared it with Schedule 5, and in particular with the reliefs in Schedule 5, with things like call-in applications and so on, and I do not think that Amendment No. 141 has any policy change implications at all. It simply saves about 1½ pages of drafting, but I doubt that it will appeal to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>934</span>
Minister. In any case, I do not think it covers the Northern Ireland points which have to be dealt with in Schedule 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Amendments 119 and 172, which I personally regard as better amendments, and these press for further concessions. In the case of Amendment No. 119 it would seek to include planning applications made prior to 12th July 1974. That is a quite deliberate date. The Minister will immediately spot that it is, of course, two months prior to 12th September 1974. Under the Planning Acts a local authority is under a statutory duty to determine a planning application within two months, or rather if it does not do so the applicant then has a right to serve notice of appeal on the grounds of non-determination. He may choose not to do so and choose to negotiate, but those are his rights. After two months, if the application is not determined, he may serve notice of appeal on grounds of non-determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we are saying here is that planning applications which were submitted up to two months before White Paper day, and which, of course, are subsequently granted after that date—I need hardly elaborate on why they have to be granted because if they are not granted, no development land tax will accrue anyway—ought to enjoy the relief as the stock in trade relief as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 172, which I may briefly discuss and then take the two together, simply says that any application which was made before White Paper day, even if it was subsequently determined afterwards satisfactorily from the point of view of the applicant, should attract the Clause 16 stock in trade relief as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point here is that we are trying to deal with the difficulties which many applicants experience in getting a decision out of the local authority. The law says that they are entitled to an answer within two months. In practice, in many cases, they do not get an answer in two months. I forget exactly what figures Mr. Dobry's Report gave on this matter, although it showed that 80 per cent. or more were determined within the statutory two months. Of course, the 20 per cent. which are not determined within the statutory two months are usually the difficult 20 per cent. They are those which involve the building of more than one house, or not just a garage to somebody's house. They are housing estates
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1070">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>935</span>
and that sort of thing. They are the ones to which for two months the situation does not usually apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we argue that the applicant had already launched his application prior to White Paper day, and if he subsequently gets planning permission after White Paper day, we do not see that he is in any significantly different position from where the Minister has called in the application which is specifically exempted under Schedule 5 of the Bill as now drafted. Nobody could possibly say that this would allow evasion because nobody could possibly have known the operative date for the purpose of this Bill. All the applications by definition would have had to be in before the White Paper on Land was published on 12th September 1974, and nobody would be getting an uncovenanted benefit which he could have known about after the White Paper was published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think these are reasonable amendments. They take into account the reality of the position, which is that local authorities sometimes for good reasons, and sometimes for not very good reasons, are often slow at determining planning applications and we see no reason why the unfortunate builder should be penalised by losing his stock in trade exemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments, as the hon. Gentleman said, seek to extend the stock in trade exemption to cases where there had been an application for planning permission before 12th September 1974 but, and for whatever reason, that permission was not granted until after 12th September 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to the two exceptions which I mentioned earlier in relation to refusals and then appeals and to calling in by the Secretary of State, the position of the legislation is that if a person has applied before 12th September 1974 but did not get planning permission by that date, he would not get the stock in trade exemption. In these amendments the hon. Gentleman seeks to extend that exemption to cases where application has been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman makes the point—and it is a fair point—that in many cases applications will have been put in before 12th September 1974 and through no fault of the person applying for planning permission, he will not have been given that permission. Local authorities may be slow. There are all sorts of reasons. But
	<span class='label label-info column'>936</span>
it is because there may be all sorts of reasons that I cannot go along with the hon. Gentleman's amendments. The person may have put in an application for planning permission, not expecting to develop his land for a long time. Some people may have put the application in because they could see that the White Paper was coming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that is not a question of avoidance, and I accept that. But between February 1974 and September 1974 there was a change of Government and some people—I am not saying this is an argument against accepting the amendment—would say, "Let us send them in quickly, just in case. Let us get our planning applications in." They, too, would have sent them in purely for that reason.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there are many reasons why applications would have been made before 12th September 1974 and, no doubt, there would have been many reasons why those applications were not granted before 12th September 1974. Some of the reasons might have been local authority delay; some might have been the complicated nature of the application. There could be a multitude of reasons. That is why I do not think that we could extend the date or the exemption. I accept entirely that there will be some hard cases where people will be penalised because of the non-action of the local authority to give planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has tabled another amendment—No. 341—which is more limited in this regard and I may have something more to say on that. But as for these amendments, they seem to us to go too far. I accept that there will be hard cases. I have had correspondence, and the Revenue has consulted widely on the matter. Representations have been made to us, too. There will be hard cases, but there will be other cases not so hard which will be brought into the exemption and which would not be deserving of it because the application was put in for other reasons. I can see the difficulty, but I cannot go along with the amendments because they are too far and too wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that the Ministers brief was not up to standard. To say that there was a multitude of reasons for putting in the application early, a multitude of merits of whether
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1071">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>937</span>
the person is deserving of consideration, if he anticipated that there would be a General Election or that there would be a White Paper, is not a good argument for applying the tax to these cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is always difficulty in drawing a line, but the line drawn of the date of the planning permission being granted is not a real line in practical cases of applying for planning permission. The vital date is when the application is made. As my hon. Friend said, at that stage there could not be any question of trying to avoid the tax. In 99 cases out of 100, it must at that stage, in July, two months before the White Paper date, have been a normal case of the trader—the builder here—intending to carry on with his ordinary development, so he puts in the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, the applicant for planning permission, particularly if he is a trader who has to deal with his local authority all the time, will not treat the fact that the application has not been granted within two months as a refusal. He will go on to negotiate with the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, even that period of two months which we have suggested here will not cover every case. That is why I say that there is difficulty in drawing a line. But at least it has some legal significance, in that if he put in an application in July he could have taken steps to appeal from a non-grant of the application in the two months. In those circumstances, he should be given the benefit of Clause 16 and Schedule 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is one matter on which I personally have received more representations than on any other in the Bill. I do not mean representations from institutions and bodies, but from individuals, who are most concerned with this. I wish that we could meet their very reasonable requests that those who were carrying on with their normal trading and normal process of developing their property, applying for planning permission to do so, would be covered in the circumstances. When they put the application in, they could not possibly have known of the tax being imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am disposed, if you are prepared to allow it, Mr. Crawshaw, to
	<span class='label label-info column'>938</span>
withdraw Amendment No. 141 and to press Amendment No. 172. Will that be in order?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. Amendment No. 141 must first be withdrawn, and then the hon. Gentleman will move the other amendment formally immediately afterwards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I seek leave to withdraw Amendment No. 141, perhaps I may make another point which I should probably have made in my opening speech. In many cases, builders are persuaded to grant extensions of time by the local authority when they are negotiating. A builder might have been in negotiation on 12th September 1974. He might have been unable to bring those negotiations to a successful conclusion and forced to go to appeal. Even if successful on appeal, he would find himself penalised under the original wording of the Bill, because the refusal would not have been treated as made until the extension had expired. As it was not until the Revenue statement of 4th February 1975 that the provisions relating to appeals were made known, the builder was denied the opportunity of protecting his position by lodging notice of appeal as soon as the statutory two-month period had elapsed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that it is the intention of the Government that builders who try to work harmoniously with local authorities should be penalised, as opposed to the builders who chose to lodge notice of appeal directly the two-month period expired. I think that the clause as it stands, if Amendment No. 172 is not accepted, will discriminate against the builder who is trying to work in harmony with the local planning authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Opposition are being entirely consistent in this matter. When the former Conservative Government proposed to introduce infrastructure contributions in the White Paper of April 1973, the basis of the proposals was that applications lodged before a certain date would be exempt from the infrastructure contributions—not planning permissions, but planning applications. Therefore, Amendment No. 172 is entirely consistent with that proposal of the Conservative Government in consultation papers with which I, as the then Director of the Housebuilders Federation, had to deal.

The writer of that brief—I have not intention of saying who it was—is obviously not a fan of local authorities. That is clear.

The purpose of this amendment is to say that as Schedule 5 is at present drafted, it has an unfair onus as to how the reasonableness of the expectation is to be arrived at. We have tried in Amendment No. 342 to make it slightly less

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 341 seeks to deal with a case—subject to the date in the amendment of 12th November 1975—where it might be thought there was some injustice in the Bill as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman will know that an application made by a developer to a local authority is deemed to have been refused if there has been no response within a given time, which is normally two months. If an appeal is lodged against the deemed disposal, it is not uncommon for the planning authority to realise it has been dilatory and to offer to grant permission if the appeal is withdrawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill as drafted might not allow such permission to qualify for stock relief because it was granted after 12th September 1974. In those circumstances, it might be argued that that kind of case, which is just and reasonable, was not given the benefit of the exemption. I therefore give the assurance to the hon. Gentleman that we shall look at the drafting again to help that kind of situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One such case has been brought to our attention, and we have received representations. We shall seek to put the drafting right to deal with that kind of case. I want to stress again that we are concerned here with 12th September 1974, not 12th November 1975, which is the date in the amendment. My assurance does not cover that date. We shall seek to deal with the technical refusal in the legislation. At the moment it may not be clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 342 seeks to change the Bill to allow the person who applied for the planning permission to decide what might reasonably have been expected. I think the hon. Gentleman will recognise that it will not be possible in a taxing measure to go that far. Perhaps some local authorities and developers have no idea what might reasonably be expected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term in question in the legislation has not given rise to many disputes in the past in cases which have gone to the Lands Tribunal or to the courts. It is clear that it is usual to accept that the salient factor is what the planning authority might consider reasonable, and not what the owner might consider reasonable. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>942</span>
does not help the hon. Gentleman much, but I understand that these matters sometimes reach the courts and that the phrase has not created too much difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No. 342.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 343, in page 102, line 45, leave out 'the relevant planning enactment' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'Section 30(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971'.</p></blockquote>
This is a drafting amendment which seeks to remove the words "the relevant planning enactment" which come at the end of page 102. Schedule 5(3)(2) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In sub-paragraph (1) above 'planning permission granted for a limited period' has the meaning assigned to it by the relevant planning enactment."</p></blockquote>
If one looks at the interpretation clause—Clause 46—on page 69 one sees the definition of the words "the relevant planning enactment" in relation to land in England and Wales. Instead of saying the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 it specifically says "section 290(1)" of that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The limited planning permission comes under Section 30(1) and (2) of the 1971 Act. Subsection (2), which is the one mentioned in the amendment, states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any planning permission granted subject to such a condition as is mentioned in subsection(1)(	<i>b</i>) of this section is in this Act referred to as 'planning permission granted for a limited period'."</p></blockquote>
That is what we are talking about in this paragraph of Schedule 5.

It may be that some general words in Section 290 of the 1971 Act—an Act with which we became very familiar during the Committee stage of the Community Land Bill—do include this and can be interpreted. However, it would be far more helpful to the person who has to

	<span class='label label-info column'>943</span>
carry on a practice by reference to this Bill, when it becomes an Act, if the reference were specifically made here to the relevant section of the 1971 Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman referred the Committee to page 69 where the words "relevant planning enactment" are defined. That definition relates to the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, under various Scottish and Irish provisions. He seeks, in fact, to short-circuit to some extent that method of doing it by referring directly, in relation to England, to Section 30(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. I should point out to him that all the provisions contained on page 69 refer by implication to the relevant sections: in the case of England it is Section 30(2).

The amendment short-circuits the reference by enabling the reader to go directly to Section 30(2). I am advised that the amendment is defective in the sense that it does not list the Scottish and Northern Ireland provisions which define the term. To include a reference to these provisions would lengthen the Bill slightly, and it is for this reason that paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 5 is drafted in the way that it is. References to the "relevant planning enactment" are also made in the definition of "development" and of "planning permission", both contained in Clause 46(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are advantages and disadvantages with both approaches. Under the method adopted in the Bill the reader may take a few seconds longer to find the definition, but it avoids references to the three planning enactments having to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>944</span>
made in each definition. For this reason we think it is a better approach, but the right hon. Gentleman is experienced in these matters and clearly his approach is also a reasonable one and we shall look at this again. At present, however, the draftsman's view is that his approach is better, for the reasons I have given.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This was a try-out amendment and, had it been accepted, we should have added the appropriate sections at a later stage relating to Scotland and Ireland.

I winced rather when the Minister said that it would take only a few seconds for the reader to look up Section 290 of the 1971 Act, find it had nothing whatever to do with this clause, and then search through the 1971 Act to find out which section of that Act refers to this. I agree about the economy of words, but when economy of words in an Act lead the reader into some confusion, the economy is not worthwhile. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will look at this again, and I hope he will agree with what I say. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
