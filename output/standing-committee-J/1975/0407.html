	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the end of our last sitting I was saved by the bell when moving Amendment No. 41, in page 6, line 20, leave out from 'effect' to end of line 29 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'as if the chargeable person and the person from whom he acquired his interest ("the connected person") were a single person so that—
	<ol>
	<li>the references to cost and expenditure in that subsection shall be taken to mean the aggregate of the cost or other expenditure as the case may be, incurred by both the chargeable person and the connected person and</li>
	<li>the tax payable by the connected person as a result of his disposal shall be treated as a payment on account of the tax payable on the disposal by the chargeable person.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(6) Where subsection (5) above applies the connected person shall be liable for so much of the tax as would have arisen on his disposal if subsection (5) above had not been enacted and the chargeable person shall be liable for the amount by which the tax payable on his disposal exceeds that amount referred to above'.</p></blockquote>
With it we were discussing Amendment No. 58, in page 6, leave out lines 24 and 25.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To recapitulate briefly, subsection (5), as we understand it, is designed as a tax avoidance measure in its present form. I made the point that, if the Government Amendment, No. 58, were carried, the wording would be altered, and I described how subsection (5) would then apply in relation to the rest of the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that there could be, without subsection (5), a shuttlecock of transactions in the same interest in land between two connected pe	<i>s</i>sons, and that, without some such provision as subsection (5) or the amendment, it might be possible in theory to achieve a mark-up in value in the land by transactions between connected persons. We think it reasonable that such an attempt to avoid tax should be prevented by the terms of the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>380</span>
The Government's proposed method of doing this is to disallow the 10 per cent. mark-up on the cost of the chargeable person's acquisition of the interest as described in Base C or, in the case of Base A, to deprive him of the special addition which is a material part of the increase in value which the chargeable person can claim when establishing the base value for computation of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to anticipate what the Minister of State may say when he formally moves Amendment No. 58, but since the Bill was drafted it seems that the Treasury has realised that the current use value could not be affected by transactions between connected persons, and therefore there is no need to disallow the 10 per cent. margin of tolerance about which we were talking in another context at our last sitting, when Base B is involved. No doubt, the Minister of State, when he moves that amendment, will give the Governments authoritative explanation, and I hope that I am correct in interpreting its intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. and hon. Friends and I have added our names to that amendment because we agreed with the reasoning as I have described it—at least, if that is the intention of the amendment. We recognise the problem which subsection (5) is designed to meet, but we would prefer it to be met by a different approach. Our suggestion is that the connected persons should in these cases be treated as one person. This, we feel, might not have exactly the same effect as the provision as it stands, but at least it would meet the point of avoiding artificial moves to increase the cost by reference to which the computation for development land tax would be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that it would be more sensible to retain the basic principles of the three bases, A, B, and C, and to allow the special addition to be retained for the whole period during which the interest in land remained in the ownership of either of the connected persons, whichever of them at any point during that period was the actual owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would be more equitable. It would not cut off allowance of the special addition—I imagine the Government would not wish to cut that off in 	<i>bona fide</i> cases—from a person merely because he had acquired it during the course of the year from a person connected with them. We do not believe that this would create
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0775">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>381</span>
any new loophole by which the connected person could exploit the provisions of the Act in relation to the valuation of the tax. If we have missed it, perhaps the Minister will point it out to us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is acceptable to the Government, it will be necessary, as will be seen from the words on the Amendment Paper, for an extra subsection—numbered in Amendment No. 41 as subsection (6)—to be added—in order to regulate the apportionment of tax liability between the two parties who are connected persons and between whom transactions of this kind would take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that with a complex arrangement of this kind the drafting of the amendment is not 100 per cent. consistent with all the other provisions of the Bill. But in spite of possible defects of that kind, we hope that the words on the Amendment Paper accurately reflect our suggestion that the possibility of tax avoidance between connected persons could be dealt with in this different way, which would have the advantage in relation to the retention of the special addition which I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I make two points about the drafting of subsection (5). First, if Amendment No. 58 is carried, we shall be left with a sub-subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>)(i) followed by sub-subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>)(iii). I hope that this can be tidied up at a later stage in the Bill. Recently we had an amendment No. 4A and, again, I wonder whether this sort of thing can be tidied up in the final version of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to bring into the discussion starred Amendment No. 118, in page 6, line 26, leave out paragraph (iii) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(iii) paragraph (	<i>c</i>) were to read "the aggregate of the cost of the chargeable person's acquisition of the interest and 110 per cent. of any expenditure on improvements"'.</p></blockquote>
I tabled it at a late hour last night, in my name only, not because I was shy of making the amendment but because I did not have an opportunity of discussing it with my right hon. and hon. Friends, I felt, too, that such a daring amendment should not be foisted upon them without the fullest consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hoped also that it might be possible for some hon. Members opposite to express their sympathy with Amendment No. 118 if it was not backed by the full panoply of Opposition names, but was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>382</span>
just a piece of personal freelance amending on my own part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to translate subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>)(iii) from double-Dutch into single English. I do not know whether it is a test of cerebral virility of parliamentary draftsmen that they should try to use 35 words of gobbledegook when 27 words of English would do instead. But if the words in subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>)(iii) are applied to paragraph (	<i>c</i>) on the preceding page and it is then written out again in English in the form which I have tried to do in Amendment No. 118, the number of lines and the number of words is reduced and the amount of time taken by anyone using the Bill to work out what the whole thing means is reduced also. I tabled the amendment, to coin a phrase, wholly and exclusively in the interests of comprehensibility.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should remember that the amendment has not been selected and he should make only a brief reference to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your comments entirely, Mr. Fitch. I feel that I have already made the point, and because all the clauses already discussed are not easy to comprehend at first glance, this was an attempt within the context of the discussion of these clauses to suggest a way in which the Bill might be made simpler to comprehend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I crave your indulgence, Mr. Fitch, and while replying to this amendment, may I also move Amendment No. 58, which is a Government amendment? This amendment has a bearing on Amendment No. 41 and, to some extent, might meet some criticisms made by the hon. Gentleman in relation to Amendment No. 41. Perhaps I could first move Amendment No. 58 and, if this is agreeable to you, Mr. Fitch, then deal with the points raised on Amendment No. 41.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member may move Amendment No. 58 formally afterwards. As we are discussing both amendments together, there is no need to discuss Amendment No. 58 now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. I shall discuss Amendment No. 58 first,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0776">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>383</span>
as this amendment may go some way towards meeting the hon. Gentleman's requirements, although I accept that Amendment No. 41 seeks to look at the problem in a different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman correctly has divined, Amendment No. 58 removes Base B from the anti-avoidance provisions in the subsection. The hon. Gentleman has stated correctly that there is no need to bring Base B into the anti-avoidance scheme because there is no way in which the current use value can be manipulated for the purposes of the special sales taking place between connected persons within a very short time. Amendment No. 58 would, therefore, remove completely Base B and the anti-avoidance provision would not then apply to Base B. It would apply only to Base C in particular to the special addition and the 10 per cent. uplift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) indicated, this a complicated area, and I found it difficult to discern what was the real difference between Amendment No. 41 and the way the Government wish to deal with the matter. Towards the end of his speech the hon. Gentleman indicated that he was concerned that in the legislation, as drafted, special addition would be denied once there was a connected sale or a collusive sale, if that is the right way of describing it. Under Amendment No. 41, special addition would continue to run, whereas special addition stops at the first point, as the Government have drawn the legislation. The hon. Gentleman said that he thought that it was unreasonable that this should be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's view, although I can see some of his argument. The Government consider that in the case of connected sales, which take place quickly it is reasonable to take away special addition which has been given to enable developers to finance the cost of acquisition. The Government do not think that the legislation should be amended to give special addition in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand from the draftsmen—I am not making a technical point—that Amendment No. 41 is somewhat defective in drafting. I do not say that as a criticism. I merely say that to show how difficult it is to deal with this kind of situation. As drafted, I understand, it would make the position worse and, indeed, would open
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>384</span>
some loopholes. As I say, that is not criticism. It is just to show how difficult it is to frame legislation to cover this kind of sitaution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also told by the Inland Revenue that if the defects in the drafting of Amendment No. 41 were put right, it would still make it more difficult in practice, for technical reasons, to operate the rules that the hon. Gentleman requires, than it would be to operate the rules which the Inland Revenue wish to include in the Bill. I accept that these are two different ways of approaching this problem. But I am bound to say, on the advice that I have been given, that the Revenue feels—and I go along with this—that this is a better way of dealing with a very difficult situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we went along his way, we would introduce more technicalities into the legislation than exist at the moment. So I ask the Committee not to accept Amendment No. 41. I shall move Amendment No. 58 formally later on, as you suggested, Mr. Fitch. In fact, Amendment No. 58 goes some way to meet the points raised by the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Heaven forbid that we should make the Bill more technical, and I had hoped that our amendment would not do that. May I say, first, that we certainly welcome Amendment No. 58, if the whole clause is not to be altered, as suggested in our amendment. Amendment No. 58 leaves Base B as it stands, and that would be applied to these transactions between connected persons. But I feel that if subsection (5) stands there will be certain strange results which will be a hardship on certain people who have not carried out a collusive transaction in any way, or have not been involved in it. That was what we attempted in this amendment, namely, to avoid those people suffering, although, of course, we go alone with the Government in trying to prevent the tax avoidance here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that this was a difficult clause to understand. So also is it difficult, although he was very lucid in what he said, to digest at once the objection which the hon. Gentleman has put forward to our amendment. I think this is obviously one of those amendments—and I am sure my hon. Friend will think so, too—that one doesn't drive to a Division because it is so technical.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0777">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>385</span>
I for one would certainly like an opportunity to look again at what the Minister has said, and to see exactly how it fits in with the ideas which we have endeavoured to embody in this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman mentioned that there were some cases which might suffer as a result. I have some idea of what those cases might be, and after he has studied what I have said, if he cares to indicate the kind of situations that he has in mind, I will certainly look at them to see whether it is possible to improve the drafting. But, as he indicated, this is extremely difficult. We have no desire to catch genuine transactions. On the other hand, we are in the area of sales and the transfer of something of value between connected persons, and the difficulty in these cases is to catch the tax avoider without catching genuine transactions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 58, in page 6, leave out lines 24 and 25.—[	<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, Amendment No. 61, in page 6, line 32, after 'representatives', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(or in Scotland heirs and executors)'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Crawford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford) will understand this matter fully. I am almost tempted to ask him to explain it to us, but since I do not have faith in his universal knowledge, I shall make some attempt to explain it to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Renton Committee commented on the almost impossible task of English lawyers framing a Bill for England and then attempting to translate it into the law of Scotland by just changing words. It is bad enough when they do not, as I have said before, but when they attempt to do so, it is like somebody who speaks French as badly as I do attempting to translate a text from English into French because although the words apparently
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>386</span>
have a similar meaning, in reality they do not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words "personal representatives" as they appear in line 32 mean absolutely nothing in the law of Scotland. They certainly would not mean authorised personal representatives. They might mean any intromitter with the effects of the deceased. The term "personal representative" is defined in Section 55 of the Administration of Estates Act 1925, which applies only to England and Wales. It is further defined in Clause 46 as including also
	<br><blockquote><p>"persons having in relation to the deceased under the law of another country any functions corresponding to the functions for administration purposes under the law of England and Wales of personal representatives as so defined".</p></blockquote>
This is obviously intended to apply to legal systems other than in England and Wales and is, presumably, intended to apply, by generality, to Haiti, Guatemala and Scotland. But the term, as defined, has absolutely no meaning in the law of Scotland. I assume that it is intended—although I would not insult he Minister by suggesting that I am wise to the nuance of the law of England—to mean what we in Scotland would call "heirs and executors", those who are entitled either by appointment or default, to be the intromitters with the estate of the deceased. I hope the Government will accept that point. It illustrates one of the difficulties of having a United Kingdom Act framed by English lawyers which is translated into language not applicable to the law of Scotland. The two systems of law are so different in origin, content and principle that it is confusing and difficult when we attempt to apply them to matters of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will accept my word—which I am willing for him to pay for if he wishes it to be heightened into an opinion—that this is a proper translation of what in my opinion the words "personal representatives" are intended to mean in the Bill. If he thinks he could get better counsel, either cheaper or more expensive, I should be interested to know where.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Crawford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to see that the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) has the benefit of the paper produced by the Law Society of Scotland, which in its own submission in subparagraph 16 suggests the same amendment as the hon. and learned Gentleman
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0778">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>387</span>
has actually put down on paper. Doubtless other mebmers of the Committee have the same paper from the Law Society of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased also to see that the hon. and learned Gentleman is in favour of Scots law. At an early stage of the Committee proceedings he said that Scots law was a guarantee of the continuing existence of Scottish nationalism. I suggest that the existence of the SNP is a continuing guarantor of Scots law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman that there are great difficulties for any United Kingdom Bill which is framed by a parliamentary draftsman who may be versed in English law and not Scots law. As the Law Society of Scotland has said, it is very concerned to ensure that the Bill should apply
	<br><blockquote><p>"no more harshly in Scotland than it does in England."</p></blockquote>
If the Minister does not accept this amendment moved by the hon. and learned Gentleman, I personally will take it to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) mentioned the Renton Committee. He is aware that the Renton Committee made written recommendations about the extremely difficult problem of drafting and the inter-relationships in the law of Scotland and the law of England. I understand that it has been announced that a Joint Committee of the two Houses will be set up—although I do not think that it has yet met to consider this matter in relation to legislation in general. It is not a problem arising merely in the case of this particular Bill. It arises in respect of much legislation that goes through the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that this is a problem, and I am sure that when the Joint Committee sits it will come up with a recommendation to resolve this difficulty. Although the draftsmen consult, one has to admit that in the past there has been a tendency to draft in relation to the law of England and Wales and to adapt where possible in relation to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman seeks that the words "heirs and executors" be included in relation to Scotland. I have no knowledge of this subject. But I am advised that the expression "heirs and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>388</span>
executors" is not a term equivalent to the words in the Bill "personal representatives", because heirs do not normally participate in the administration of an estate. I have no way of knowing whether or not that is correct. But that is the best advice that I have, and I have no reason to doubt that it is correct. I am told also that the comparable categories in Scotland might be "executors nominate", "executors dative", and "judicial factors" who are executors appointed by the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one starts mentioning these terms, of course, one sees the difficulty of the draftsman. But the draftsman has not been wholly oblivious to the law of Scotland. Both the hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford) will see that Clause 46—the interpretation clause—states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"personal representatives as defined in relation to England … by section 55 of the Administration of Estates Act 1925"—</p></blockquote>
It goes on in a way which would not be wholly satisfactory to Scotland—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and persons having in relation to the deceased under the law of another country any functions corresponding to the functions for administration purposes under the law of England and Wales"—</p></blockquote>
which, of course, means that Scotland is bracketed together with diverse countries throughout the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I think it only right that I should tell the Committee that I shall seek to get that particular definition changed so as to make clear that we are referring to the law of Scotland as well as to the law of England and Wales and then to other countries. That would be fair and right. I agree that it should not stand this way in the definition clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But for the reasons I have given I do not believe that it would be possible to include heirs and executors. I am advised that that would not fully cover the position. I suggest that the best way to deal with the matter is to amplify a little the interpretation clause to make clear that Scotland comes into the provision as well, instead of referring to Scotland as "other countries" as the definition stands. With that assurance, I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will not press the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point I was making was that in the interpretation clause there is no reference to Scotland but only to "other countries" besides England and Wales. I shall endeavour to see whether that might be changed to make a specific reference to Scotland, and then to "other countries", because the Bill's provisions can refer to other countries as well. We shall then have England, Wales and Scotland mentioned in the definition clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for what he has said. I appreciate that he cannot have these matters at his fingertips. I think that the advice given to the hon Gentleman cannot have come from a Law Officer in Scotland, because executors would include executors nominative and executors dative, and the heirs would, of course, be the executors dative in the absence of executors nominative. In other words, "heirs and executors" includes heirs, executives nominative, executives dative and judicial factors who are the appointed executors nominative by the court. I hope that is clear.

Different responsibilities fall on different people in the law of Scotland on succession. It is not satisfactory to try to construe them in terms of the Administration of Estates Act 1925, or merely to say that they are the equivalent. They are not equivalent people, although the task they do may be an equivalent although not the same task. They have different rights, functions and authorities in Scotland from those defined in the section relating to English law. It is completely wrong, therefore, to deal with the matter in that way. I dare say that it is wrong, too for Guatemala and Haiti. Although I studied the law of Guatemala and Haiti, I am shaky in my recollection of the law of succession in those countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the provision may do for incidental, and rare, cases of foreign countries, it is improper that where there are different powers, people and effects that we should merely say that that represents the same people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am obliged to the Minister for his remarks. I consider that an important point has been illustrated. I am not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>390</span>
obliged to the hon Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Ctawford) for once again mishearing what I said. I am hopeful that he will never sit on a jury that I address, because in my experience juries listen. I did not say that the law of Scotland was the guarantee of the Scottish National Party. I said—and the hon. Member can refer to HANSARD if he wishes to check my words—that the law of Scotland is probably the principal institution which saved the personality of Scotland. Had that not occurred, there would never have been a Scottish National Party. That is a very different matter from the hon. Gentleman's hearing of my words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crawford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman will surely agree that the very existence of the Scottish National Party is the sure guarantor that the existence of Scottish law will continue for a long time to come.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman on that. I had forgotten it and I was not going to mention it, but I shall do so now. If the hon. Member had been present in Committee more often he would have heard the number of times that I have had to point out to the Minister and Committee members the effect of the law of Scotland, which the Scottish National Party seems considerably disinterested in applying to the Bill, or to any other Bill. I think that the chance of the Scottish National Party guaranteeing the law of Scotland extremely slight, since one of its main interests appears to be to abolish the Supreme Court in Scotland, which would spell the deathknell of the law and its reporting in Scotland as a separate branch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am obliged to the Minister for saying that he will try to make the change suggested. I hope that that can be done. There will be other occasions during our proceedings when similar difficulties will arise. I hope that I may raise the issue again and that my comments will be accepted in the same spirit, that just to translate does not fit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 42, in page 6, line 37, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>c</i>) the disposal is to an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers'.</p></blockquote>
I apologise to the Committee for being somewhat schizophrenic this afternoon, because I am also trying to carry out a duty in a Select Committee at the same time. I shall be flitting in and out in the course of our deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment is concerned with widening the exemptions under subsection (6) which, in its turn, qualifies subsection (5). Subsection (5) is basically concerned with preventing transactions which are what the Revenue calls not at arm's length—where a person acquires an interest in land from someone who is connected with him, in other words, not at arm's length, and sells it on within a year or so of acquiring the interest. Subsection (5) says that in such circumstances he will not be entitled to the various special conditions in Clause 6 or the 110 per cent. tolerance. Subsection (6) says that those restrictions will not apply in the case of paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), which involve death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking to add another exemption, that the disposal by a person who has previously acquired it from someone not at arm's length is
	<br><blockquote><p>"to an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers."</p></blockquote>
The amendment contains the word "possessing" instead of "using", because in many cases the authority possessing compulsory purchase powers will buy voluntarily, but will do so under nods and winks of serving a compulsory purchase order and the powers are still there in the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We entirely accept that there have to be anti-avoidance provisions. There have to</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>392</span>
	<p>	<i>The committee divided:</i> Ayes 1, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>be provisions concerning transactions not at arm's length, otherwise there will be pieces of land floating around families and companies, and so on. But when an authority buys the land from a person who has previously bought it from, say, a relative within the preceding 12 months, in those circumstances we think it wrong that the base value should not be increased by the tolerances set out in Clause 6 and in the earlier part of Clause 5.</p>
	<p>I do not think that this is in any way an unreasonable amendment. The Minister will perhaps say that it does not matter, because the authority will simply pay 20 per cent. above current use value in any case, but we would like to see it in the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said, quite properly, that he did not wish to deny the Revenue the means of stopping these anti-avoidance collusive sales. He pointed to subsection (6) where, in the case of sales by personal representatives, or in the case of death, there would be no avoidance problems, and these would be excluded from the anti-avoidance rules.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then sought to extend that exemption to sales made to an authority possessing compulsory purchase powers. Unfortunately, I must tell him that even this type of situation could give rise to tax avoidance. This may surprise hon. Members opposite, but I can give the Committee a simple example which I have here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a notice to treat was served on person A, he could then sell to person B at a price which lay just within the development land tax tolerances, and thus escape tax. Person B, on then disposing to the acquiring authority, would then have the benefit of further special addition or tolerances. In other words, A would know that there was to be a compulsory purchase and he would receive a notice to treat, and although I am not an expert
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0781">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>393</span>
in these planning matters, I understand that a considerable time could elapse, the notice to treat comes first. So the first person receives a notice to treat, he knows there is likely to be a compulsory purchase, and he can then dispose at a price that is under value, but is sufficient to take into account the tolerances to B, who then sells to the local authority and receives the benefit of the tolerances again. This could happen to person B who might be a trustee of a family trust, for example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I sympathise with the points made by the hon. Gentleman. At first blush, I could not see why it was necessary to exclude this kind of situation. But in view of the fact that this would be a fairly simple device to operate and it would quickly become apparent—I accept that there might not be many cases, but they could involve large sums of money—I would be failing in my duty, as would the Revenue, if I were to recommend the Committee to accept this amendment. At first sight it appears quite reasonable, but I am sorry to say that I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be grateful to the Minister for that clear explanation. I take his points, which are quite reasonable, and I see that there could be a loophole in the circumstances he described. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The central question concerning this clause relates to the interrelation between Basis A, Basis B and Basis C. We have had a lot of discussion about it, but I think the Committee still will feel that the Minister of State's reply was unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer he gave to me has caused me to reflect for some time during the last 24 hours. He said very clearly, in reply to my question recorded in column 369 of the 	<i>Official Report,</i> that it would be the duty of the Revenue to consider carefully the taxpayers' position under each of these three bases. If that is so, a great deal of investigation will have to be undertaken by the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>394</span>
With base A, for instance, the Revenue will have to make an assessment of the current use value, and may have to consider the special addition. All those things will be time consuming and expensive to the Revenue, and ultimately to other taxpayers. It will mean more administration costs within the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same argument applies to a lesser extent to base B, but the same argument does not apply to anything like the same extent to base C. While I am not trying to rehearse the arguments we put forward in relation to our amendment by which we proposed that the figure of 120 should be substituted for the present figure of 110, I suggest that the Government ought to reconsider its attitude towards base C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is in the interest of the taxpayer to have a marginal advantage in allowing the relevant base value to be somewhat increased, but it is also in the interests of the Government that this should be done. It is in their interest that the cost of administration of these three calculations should be reduced, and it is very much in the interest of Government, and, indeed, of all of us, that there should be speed of agreement and collection. We are not talking about a situation where we can laugh off a bit of revenue. Speed of collection is a very important factor in relation to tax. When one has a borrowing requirement of £12 billion and a rate of inflation which will be at least 10 per cent. by the end of this year and which many respectable commentators, particularly monetarist commentators like the Minister of State, whose speech on Second Reading I read with great admiration—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never held myself out as a commentator.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a participant, an opinion former. The serious fact is that if the borrowing requirement is to be reduced it is important that tax should be collected quickly. What will happen with these three bases at present is that in most instances, as the Minister of State says, base A will be the most advantageous, but it will take a long time before the advantages of base A become obvious either to the Revenue or to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great deal to be said for making base C obviously more advantageous to the taxpayer for the reason that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0782">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>395</span>
it is a simple calculation to make and, when one makes that simple calculation, the Revenue will be able to say to the taxpayer "Don't let's argue about the current use value. Don't let's argue about the special addition. Don't even let's argue too much about the relevant improvements". The Revenue will be able to say to the taxpayer "We accept there may be 10 per cent. or even 20 per cent. between us".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Revenue will be able to say "Even if we take your figures, none the less it is obvious to everybody that the simple base C is the one that is most advantageous to you". If the taxpayer agrees with that argument, he will be able to say "Let us take base C and not argue any more". Of course, there will be an advantage to the taxpayer in that. There will be the advantage in a marginal increase in the relevant base value. But there will also be an advantage to the Government, there will also be an advantage in terms of more speedy collection of tax and in the reduced cost of administration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we can benefit the Government and benefit the taxpayer at the same time, it is perhaps a unique situation in tax matters. But surely it is this simple, speedily collected tax that we should be looking to. This can be done by making Base C the most advantageous of the three.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister of State will reconsider his arguments about this. We do not want a situation where taxpayers and the Revenue are arguing about Base A for three or four years. This was instanced on the old capital gains tax, because there has not been much tax collected from development gains tax. In the old days, before 17th December 1973, where land was being sold and there was not a rollover in respect of farm land or land in business use, everybody who has had any thing to do with this section of the law knows that arguments go on for year after year. It is often four or five years before the money is collected by the Revenue from the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When there is a 25 per cent. rate of inflation, it makes a complete mockery of the situation between various other taxpayers. How would the chap who is paying PAYE every week feel if he knew that many of the people who pay large sums of money under DLT, DGT or capital gains tax were able to postpone their liability for so long?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>396</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my hon. Friend will not press this argument too strongly, because the Government have already taken on board the idea that they can charge whatever tax they like. One then argues about it and gets it all back if it is wrong years later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am arguing this because it seems to me that the reality of the situation ought to be known. I have no doubt that many hon. Gentlemen opposite will go back and tell their constituents at the weekend that they have hammered the rich once again. They will take the message back that if one votes Labour one will kick the property developers and owners into the floor. We all know that a certain amount of rubbish is talked in politics on both sides, and I do not wish to be too offensive to those who share what is now my first profession and now talk rubbish to their supporters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reality is that it is grossly unfair at times of vast inflation if one class of taxpayers is able to defer its liability for a long time compared with other classes of taxpayers who have to pay on the nail. In this instance, if Base C were made a good deal more generous, it would be fair to the individual taxpayer who pays his DLT, it would be good for the Government, and would be fair in relation to other taxpayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely support what my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton South - West (Mr. Budgen) has just said. He referred to the advantage of speed of collection. I have in mind the advantages of the ease of collection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Minister would be very much against the idea of having to increase the staff of the Revenue or of the DLT office at Middlesbrough, or, indeed, any other section of Government employees, to deal with the raising of relatively small amounts of tax. One of the problems we are likely to be faced with in the administration of this tax is the amount of time that will be spent on cases which eventually emerge either not to be liable to tax at all or to be liable only to a small amount of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not entirely convinced that any of the amendments that we have so far discussed come to grips with the scope of the problem, because if one studies the alternatives open to the taxpayer one is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0783">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>397</span>
aware that the expenditure on "relevant improvements" features in all three of Bases A, B and C. We shall in due course be discussing what is or is not included in "relevant improvements". I think that when we come to that discussion it will be clear that there are matters whose cost will be difficult to determine accurately, because costs on works may have been incurred a number of years previously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we assume that this legislation will be passed and remain on the statute book, and hopefully improved, for some time, there will be cases in which expenditure was incurred a number of years earlier. In many cases, precise records may not have been kept. Estimates will have to be made and may be disputed. The Revenue also, if it suspects that things are other than as presented to it, may have to involve itself in a good deal of work purely on this matter of relevant improvements. I therefore think that we shall find when we come to the next schedule that a large number of elements is involved in relevant improvements which may in due course—in the effluxion of time, I think it is called—prove to be rather difficult to determine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It therefore seems to me that we ought to be considering the allowable base value in such a way as to consider what is the simplest method of determining whether there is a case which will involve tax which can be arrived at very quickly, and, secondly, that the very small cases which will involve a quite disproportionate of work both for the DLT office and for the taxpayer are excluded. I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) was right in indicating Base C as being possibly the most advantageous to consider from this point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the amendment that we discussed earlier—and which we should not rediscuss now—would in fact have met the point over a period. I know that the Minister would like to think that this legislation is to be on the statute book for a long time—to get there first and to stay there for ever is a very long time. I do not think that even an all-seeing Parliament should try to place anything on the statue book for all time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would certainly have to be there for ever if anyone on earth were to understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>398</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend has a very good point. It might not be long enough for some of us. I suppose that comprehension should increase in that the longer it stays on the statute book the more likely it is to be improved and simplified, although that may be proved wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that there is an all-party commitment to finding a method of taxing betterment, although the Opposition are far from convinced that the Government have found the best method. If we are to find some common ground on this, or even some middle ground—I forget which is approved these days and which is not—we must look for a tax which is relatively simple and will not lead to the kind of cases which get adverse publicity, which involve years of dispute and where it then turns out that only a derisory amount of tax was payable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has considerable personal and professional experience in the assessment of the old capital gains tax on land profits. I wonder whether he would confirm what I have heard, namely, that in certain circumstances capital gains tax is not agreed until five or six years have elapsed after the gain has been made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would rapidly disclaim any professional skill, otherwise I might be accused of boasting of membership of institutions of which I was not a member. But I understand that that is the case. One disadvantage on the capital gains tax side is that a great deal of time and administrative cost is incurred in working out the capital gains tax that would become payable, if it were ever to become payable, because the roll-over relief provisions prevented it from every becoming payable. Therefore, this appears to be somewhat abortive expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point I was making, I ask the Government to look again at the bases they have put forward because, if they talk to the professionals—the surveyors, the valuers, the tax consultants and the accountants—who will need to be involved in this work, they will receive advice that it will prove to be time-consuming. In a number of cases clearly affected, the time would be justified
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0784">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>399</span>
because of the large amounts of tax to be paid. But it should not be beyond the whit of man to devise a system of base values which would be fair to the taxpayer, which would be a great deal simpler to operate, and which would exclude relatively minor cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister winds up this debate, I hope that he will say something on the possibility of further consultations on that aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other minor point about which I am not too clear. Subsection (6), which states in what circumstances the disallowance referred to in subsection (5) shall not occur, does not refer to company liquidation. That is a type of so-called forced disposal which should be considered for inclusion in this subsection, in the same way as disposal by personal representatives in the course of administering a deceased's estate is included. There may, indeed, be other company circumstances, following upon a merger or something like that, where it would be proper to reinstate the extra bits that are excluded in certain circumstances under subsection (5). I therefore ask the Minister of State to look at that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly endorse the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) and other hon. Members. I beseech the Minister and his advisers not to be so obsessed with the desire to catch everybody out, and prevent even the smallest whitebait from getting through the net, by having such a complicated system that it frustrates fairness to people in general and also to the tax system. I wish Treasury Ministers, in particular, and their advisers, who so often have their eyes that close to small print that they develop an inevitable optical distortion, would accept that it is better to have a principle which is easy to understand, fair and quick and let a few minnows or, if necessary, whales get away with avoidance, than to devise a system intended to catch on the same hook every fish and mammal—imaginary or otherwise—that has ever swum in the sea.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I seriously think that the Government should look at these bases. If they simplified them, instead of having the scrooge-like desire to conceive of every situation in which someone might cheat or get away with something, they would do great benefit to themselves, to the law and to the administration of tax. There
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>400</span>
is an obsession with avoidance which is stimulated by the complication of tax. The simpler it is the fairer it is and the quicker it is the fewer who are likely to try to cheat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it was during discussions on the last Finance Bill—that is, one of those many Finance Bills in one of those non-Budgets we had last year—that the Shadow Chancellor observed that the Labour Party seemed to regard life as a loophole out of death. We need to be careful to frame our legislation so that it is comprehensible, and if by chance some of the bullets miss that is bad luck.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me say one other thing as an indication of the ease with which both the taxpayer and the Revenue will be able to interpret the clause. One must assume, for the purposes of interpretation, that whoever framed the clause was an immigrant who did not speak the language common to Scotland as well as England. The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford) has gone again—I am so sorry. He has no doubt gone to make a report that I did not vote for Scotland about heirs and executors. He said that he was going to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is nothing about that in the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do apologise, Mr. Fitch. However, it seems to me that in English it is a phenomenally bad concept to have Clause 5(1)(	<i>c</i>) saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"110 per cent. of the aggregate of the cost of the chargeable person's acquisition of the interest and of any expenditure on improvements"</p></blockquote>
and so on. Then Clause 5(5) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"subsection (1) above shall have effect for determining the relevant base value of that interest as if— …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>iii</i>) in paragraph (	<i>c</i>), the words '110 per cent. of' were transferred from the beginning of the paragraph to follow the word 'and' and the word 'of', in the last place where it occurs, were omitted."</p></blockquote>
A more absurd way to legislate one could not conceive. It is like saying that Field-Marshal Viscount Montgomery is the same as Lord George-Brown, assuming that "Montgomery" "Field-Marshal", "Viscount" and "Alamein" are omitted, and "Brown" and "George" are transferred and a hyphen is put between. It is bad legislation in every possible way. I take the greatest offence to the fact that what is done is to write a sentence which says, if I can remember my Latin, "	<i>Cur mater,</i>

	<i>sus mala est</i>" which can mean either "Run, mother, the pig is eating the applies" or "Run, you rotten mother, you are a pig", or a variety of other things according to the order it is in. To have a sentence in English such as "Thou shalt not commit adultery", and then have another section which transfers it into something meaning something totally different, is one of the most phenomenal things in legislation that I have ever seen. I trust that, before the Bill reappears on Report, this offence to common sense will have been replaced by a shorter sentence which says what in subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>)(iii) it is meant to mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I do not find anything in the clause about pigs or adultery, there are a couple of drafting points I should like to make, renewing points which have been made in the course of the debates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection (1), we still have bases A, B and C, and I hope that the Minister has taken it on board that we should like those lettered in a different way so as to distinguish them from the bases A, B and C in other legislation. I do not think it will be possible for him to turn them round the other way, which would have been the right way to draft it. It involves such a mass of redrafting that the best thing to do is to call them by some other letters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My other drafting point concerns subsection (5), a point mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart), where the amendments to subsection (1) are made by insertions when it would be so easy merely to repeat the paragraphs as a whole instead of making the reader refer back to the early part of Clause 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the draftsmen will consider redrafting subsection (5) completely, so that it is not necessary to refer back. It will take no more lines to rewrite subsection (1) to say that this is the way it applies in cases of connected persons. There would not then be this continual turning to and fro from one page to the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one or two points of substance to make. Subsection (4) deals with deductions from expenditure where the expenditure which is to be taken into account shall not include certain items. One item is any money that has been
	<br><blockquote><p>"provided or met, directly or indirectly, by the Crown".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>402</span>
Does this include tax allowances and reliefs? I have in mind industrial developments in development areas where certain allowances will be made, perhaps not directly, for the construction of the building or for the introduction of plant, and so on. Better definition is required of what is intended here in order to avoid litigation over the phrase "directly or indirectly".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are so many cases in development areas—as my constituency is in a development area, I speak from that standpoint—where the assistance is made indirectly. If that has to be taken into account here, it may well deter desirable industrial expansion in development areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that these were points of substance, but I have one of drafting on the penultimate line of subsection (4). I am aware that the clause, as drafted, dates back at least to 1945 and has been slavishly repeated ever since. But what on earth is meant by a
	<br><blockquote><p>"local authority, whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere"?</p></blockquote>
Does that really mean a province in Canada, a county in Australia, or areas in Haiti and Guatemala? I do not know what is meant by a local authority outside the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rockall!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other points of substance are in subsection (6) (	<i>a</i>) which refers only to a disposal—
	<br><blockquote><p>"by personal representatives in the course of administering the deceased's estate,".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) raised the question of liquidation, where the personal representatives are not administering a deceased's estate: they are administering a company in liquidation. There is also the question of the trustee in bankruptcy to be considered, and I should have thought that wider scope could have been put into subsection (6)(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether subsection (6)(	<i>b</i>) would refer to gifts or trusts. They may be sufficiently dealt with elsewhere in the Bill, but subsection (6)(	<i>b</i>) deals only with the passing of an interest on the death of any person. Again, it is treated as being disposed of by the deceased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have in mind cases where, as the result of a death, an interest in property passes, not from the deceased's estate, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0786">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>403</span>
between two people outside by reason of some form of trust. In fairness, I think that ought to be included in subsection (6), although it may be that it is dealt with elsewhere in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are, I hope, constructive points on Clause 5, although it does not mean that I like Clause 5.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend raises an important point. I would like the Minister to concentrate on the concept of a life rent being passed from a husband to a wife or from a parent to a child. On death, this would pass to the children of either the parent or the child. Is that the sort of consideration my right hon. Friend had in mind?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, that is the position. I mean cases where an interest moving, not from the deceased, but from outside—for example, people under a trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I hoped that the points I made were constructive. I have been in breach of what is often referred to in our party as the "Foster J" principle, in recognition of an eminent Member on our side. He preached that, when in Opposition, one should never endeavour to improve a Government Bill. "Let them stew in their own juice" was his belief. Nevertheless, he always tried to amend Bills in the best way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So in breach of the rule which "Foster J" laid down, but in observance of the way that he conducted himself on Committees, I hope that I have been a little constructive in seeking to make Clause 5 easier to administer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One small point has occurred to me as a result of the Minister of State's remarks on Amendment No. 42. Would the Minister be good enough to elaborate a little on the principle which he enunciated? I understood him to say that the reasons for not accepting Amendment No. 42, which appeared on the face of it to be a straightforward and justifiable improvement, were that if the extra paragraph (	<i>c</i>) were introduced into subsection (6), invalidating the provisions of subsection (5) where a sale was made to a local authority under compulsory purchase, it could give rise to an intermediate transaction which would then avoid some or all of the liability to development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>404</span>
I am not clear how this differs from any sale in which there is a firm purchaser at the end. It may be that, under a compulsory order, there is a greater certainty. However, I do not think that the case is basically different from any situation where there is a willing buyer offering a highest price for an interest in land. A series of intermediate contingent transactions might be arranged which would result in most, if not all, of the potential liability to development land tax being eaten up. As the point occurred to me only after the Minister had made his remarks, I do not recollect what he said. Perhaps he would be kind enough in his concluding remarks on the clause to comment on that general point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal first with the constructive points raised by the Right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). If I may say so with respect, we are glad that he does not follow the advice of Sir John Foster or "Foster, J"—I do not know whether he ever was "Foster, J" but I know that he was Sir John Foster. He was constructive in his suggestions, which is a great help to Treasury Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall first deal with the point on bases A, B and C. I accept what the right hon. Gentleman said, but I do not think that the problem will be as great as he seems to think. The development gains charge is being phased out. It is a transitional tax and although there may be some confusion for a few years, I do not think it will be much or last long. Therefore, I would not go along with the right hon. Gentleman on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then asked why everything could not be set out again in subsection (5). That point was also raised in an eerlier amendment. We have had representations to this effect and some of the accountancy bodies are keen that these matters should be set out more fully. I notice that the Law Society has not made these representations—perhaps it is more used to going through this kind of legislation than the accountancy bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point has some validity. The difficulty may be, and I think would be, that we should thereby lengthen the Bill. We can set out fully all the exceptions that there might be to clauses in the Bill, but very often this means making the Bill even longer and we should then be criticised for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0787">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>405</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to illustrate in Amendment No. 118 how this might be done in an individual case and might actually shorten the Bill. I hope that, if there is a case where the sense is exactly the same but the Bill could be shortened by translating the relevant part into English, it will have a sympathetic reception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a valid point and we shall see if it is possible, certainly in this case, to spell out the words in subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>)(ii). As I have said, there is the problem of making the Bill longer and the matter cannot be dealt with quite as easily as hon. Gentlemen sometimes imply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked the question about Government grants in subsection (4). My advice is that grants would not come within the sums to which the subsection is directed. Certainly tax allowances will not come within such sums, as I should have thought was fairly clear, but my advice is that the grants paid under the regional incentives and Industry Acts are not intended to be covered and will not come within that particular subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then asked why the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere"</p></blockquote>
refer to "local authority". As he will appreciate, they do not refer only to "local authority". They qualify or extend the previous words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"government or public or local authority."</p></blockquote>
There could be situations where the words would be applied to the earlier words rather than to "local authority".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then there were a number of questions relating to subsection (6)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). The right hon. Gentleman raised the point which, on the face of it, seems to have some force in relation to a trustee in bankruptcy. I do not know what happens when assets are vested in a trustee in bankruptcy, but I can see that that might be an involuntary situation. The point is not a good one in relation to liquidations—the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) made the same point—because of course, liquidations need not be involuntary. I can imagine that, if one were to include liquidations, we should find a number of voluntary liquidations. I can think of several schemes that could
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>406</span>
be put up which would save a considerable amount of tax for the use of voluntary liquidations. I do not think one could possibly contemplate liquidations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another one that has just occurred to me which we might get on the record is a receiver under an order of the Court of Protection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we should look at the involuntary situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am told, in relation to subsection (4), that what I said was not correct. [Hon. Members: "Oh".]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am getting so excited.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is correct in relation to tax, grants and allowances—although I bracketed them all in tax allowances. But improvement grants towards development are caught by subsection (4), so I resile from what I said in relation to improvement grants and grants of that kind although, of course, tax allowances are not sums paid either directly or indirectly and would be excluded. But improvemetn grants towards development are included in that subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to subsection (6)(	<i>b</i>) we were asked what kind of situations were envisaged
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the death of any person".</p></blockquote>
For the purposes of this Bill where interests pass there could be a number of different cases that would bec ofered by the sub-paragraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen). He made an impassioned plea for 120 per cent. instead of 110 per cent. in relation to base C. I thought that he overstated his case. He is under the misapprehension that it would then not be necessary to do a calculation, that all that would be needed would be to have 120 per cent., and hey presto, no calculation would be necessary. That is what he seemed to imply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whatever figure is chosen—hon. Gentlemen want small exemptions not to be taxed, and we have tried to help them by exempting the first £10,000—the calculation still has to be made to decide whether one is inside or outside the exemption. However one deals with the matter, and whatever exemptions or tolerances are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0788">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>407</span>
included in legislation, at the end of the day one still has to make some calculation. The hon. Gentleman seems to be arguing for a rough and ready approach by the Revenue, saying that the Revenue should look at this from the point of 120 per cent. and say: "In that case this covers everything and we shall not worry about bases A and B. If the taxpayer pays a bit more tax, who worries?"</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstands me. All I am saying is that if base C is made more generous, when the Revenue and the taxpayer look at base A and base B they will be able to say to each other "No matter how we assess these figures under base A and base B, base C is the most advantageous". That will avoid the necessity of having detailed arguments about some of the constituent parts of base A and base B. On any calculation it will be obvious that base C is the most advantageous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may be obvious on some calculations, but it may not be obvious on a number of calculations. The hon. Gentleman postulates a situation in which the taxpayer and the Revenue look at base C and bases A and B, but often they would have to have a detailed look at base A to determine whether the taxpayer was not better off under base A than under base C and the mere fact that it was 120 per cent. under base C would not be decisive. One does not know. One has to consider all the different factors in base A to determine whether base A is better for the taxpayer than base C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great danger in the hon. Gentleman's argument that we should adopt a more broad brush approach. That may be true. Perhaps the Inland Revenue is too concerned about small amounts of tax that have to be collected or repaid. Perhaps the system should be operated in a broader way. But I can imagine the Questions that would be asked in the House if one of the hon. Gentleman's constituents were denied £2 which was due to him and if Treasury Ministers said "This was the calculation. It will take three or four days to make" and talked about the cost to the Revenue. There would be speeches about Hampden, Pym and ship money, costs, and the importance of the individual getting his tax back. It is very difficult to arrive at a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>408</span>
fair balance. But I take the hon. Gentleman's point that perhaps we should not try to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman should appreciate that interest will be charged, not from the point of assessment under this legislation, but from a fixed point in time. We shall discuss that later. So we have gone some way to meet the hon. Gentleman's other point about rich people who spend years arguing their assessments with the Revenue, and then at the end of the day the amount they have to pay has been reduced considerably by inflation, and so on. We are trying to meet that point by ensuring that the interest is payable, not from the point of assessment, but from a point much earlier. I believe that the interest payable will be 9 per cent. The hon. Gentleman may not think that is enough, but we would consider raising it, if that is what the hon. Gentleman requires.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will it work both ways?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, it will work both ways. It applies to repayments of tax as well. The point he makes is a fair point and we shall endeavour to make sure that people do not abuse these rules in order not to pay their tax for a long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) gave us a few piscatory examples about whitebait and minnows. I thought they were rather large whitebaits at £10,000, but perhaps they have large whitebait in Scotland these days. The minnows then became whales. He said "We are not worried about them. What about the whales?" We thought "He does not mind if we allow a few whales through". Again, we have to be careful. There is a £10,000 exemption, and that is not a small exemption, and I think that most small cases are covered under that exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) asked me a qusetion relating to Amendment No. 42 which I find difficult to answer. Amendment No. 42 is extremely complicated. What we were concerned with in rejecting that amendment was to prevent the kind of collusive action where a local authority is intending to make a compulsory purchase, it then being possible to manipulate that situation and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0789">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>409</span>
arrive at a means of tax avoidance. I wish I could have accepted the amendment, but I cannot in view of the danger to the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have dealt with most of the points raised by hon. Gentlemen. This is a complicated clause, as, indeed, are all these clauses. But, at the end of the day, hon. Members opposite who want a special tax never seem to tell us how their special tax will operate. It is going to be full of exemptions and high percentages on bases. It is all going to be very simple. It will disregard the law of Scotland. It will not be concerned with spelling out the different Scottish versions of English legal terms. None of this will appear in their Act, which will be about three or four clauses long and very simply drafted, applying a broad brush approach. The taxpayer will not be too worried if he does not get some of his money back, and so on. This seems to be the kind of legislation which hon. Gentlemen opposite want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would have one other essential qualification: it would be written in English.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it would be written in English, but it will be drafted not by a parliamentary draftsman but by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Housebuilders Federation, which have had great experience in these matters. It will be full of equations and figures. It will be an admirable piece of legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other qualification is that it will be comprehensible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least, it would be comprehensible to members of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. It might not be so comprehensible to other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have consulted very widely on this legislation, and the Bill has been improved as a result. We shall continue to listen to any reasonable points that are made in an effort to make the Bill as simple as we can within the confines of our tax, planning and land laws, all of which are extremely complicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Clause 5, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
</section>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>410</span>
	<div class='schedule'>Schedule 3</div> <!-- schedule -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>EXPENDITURE ON IMPROVEMENTS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 74, in page 94, line 24, after 'behalf', insert 'in connection with or'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This first amendment to the Schedule is, I hope, simple—as the Minister suggested our legislation would be—and is meant to be helpful. It is concerned with the question of the timing of any payments made on anything which might be held within the terms of the schedule to be an improvement. As we discuss the amendments and the schedule, it will obviously emerge that improvement is fairly widely defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had representations on this point from two of those expert drafting bodies to which the Minister of State has just referred, the Housebuilders Federation and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. They are concerned that the schedule as drafted debars any payment made before the time of acquisition. The particular form of payment that the Housebuilders Federation had in mind, to which the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors also referred, were payments made under Section 52 agreements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housebuilders Federation specifically says that in some cases—particularly in connection with Section 52 agreements—payments are made just before the planning permission is granted, and therefore before the purchase is actually completed. What the federation obviously has in mind are those transactions where there is an option or a conditional contract and where completion is consequent upon grant of planning permission. As it says, such a payment is obviously relevant expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors refers to the same matter, and also to expenditure in preparing plans, documents and other evidence for the purpose of obtaining planning permission. Exactly the same circumstance would apply there. The procedure for getting planning permission can be time-consuming and costly and would be relevant expenditure if incurred after acquisition, but at the moment it is debarred if incurred before acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other point about which I am not absolutely clear on the legal situation. I refer here to an agreement for lease—a very common practice in a commercial and industrial situation where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0790">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>411</span>
one signs an agreement for a lease and the lease is in due course granted after the carrying out by the signatory of certain works, which can be very costly. I hope that the cost of those works would be eligible—if there was any improvement element in them—under the terms of the schedule and under other parts of the Bill as part of the cost of acquisition. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the situation with regard to that form of transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the amendment will commend itself to the Government. We have drafted it to exclude payments which have nothing to do with the improvement of a relevant interest. However, we think it reasonable to include payments made before the time of acquisition so long as they are made "in connection with" improvement of a relevant interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said, quite rightly, that the subparagraph is aimed, in the main, at expenditure incurred at or after acquisition. He made the point that in the case of a Section 52 obligation expenditure might have been incurred before acquisition, and I accept what he said on that—that, as the words are drafted, such expenditure would not, if incurred before the acquisition, be included as improvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of an agreement for a lease. I am not sure how that would fit into the legislation, because one would need to know a little more of the facts. I assume that he means a kind of building agreement—an agreement entered into to go on the land and do certain works and then to lease it—a kind of licence, in fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The sort of agreement I mean is where there is a contract which states that a lease will be granted when one of the parties has done certain things. Those certain things could be, for instance, in the case of a factory in a dilapidated condition, a great deal of improvement works for that party; and when he finished the work, in accordance with the terms of the contract, a lease of the premises would then be granted to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I take the point, and I understand the situation. I am sure that an agreement for a lease of that kind would count as a lease under Clause 45(5) of the Bill. Presumably, if it counts as
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>412</span>
a lease, he has acquired a relevant interest in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the other point regarding Section 52. There is a difficulty there, and, while I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's amendment in its present form, we shall certainly consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While one wants to include a Section 52 situation, it is necessary to draft the legislation to exclude various other situations which might have less relevance to the acquisition of the land. Where to draw the line and how to define it is extremely difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We acknowledge the Section 52 problem, but there are difficulties in knowing where to stop and what to allow. We will look at this again to see whether we can meet the point. If the hon. Gentleman is satisfied with that assurance, I hope he will consider withdrawing his amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister of State elaborate a little more on what he means by other situations which are less directly connected with the acquisition of the relevant interest? My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) began by pointing to the more general situation where often various expenses are incurred in an acquisition before the actual time of acquisition. Leaving aside the special cases he mentioned and on which the Minister commented, I wonder how the phrasing is meant to apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, would related works of one kind or another involved with the acquisition, such as legal or other works which are accounted to the acquirer after the acquisition, be eligible, but if they were accounted to the acquirer before the acquisition would they be ineligible? I wonder whether, purely by way of explanation, the Minister could elaborate a little on what he meant when he said that it was necessary not to accept the amendment in precisely this form because he wanted to exclude some items which were less relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I remind the Minister of the words with which we did not entirely delight him, but which were certainly better than nothing in Clause 4, where we were talking about apportionment? It was said that the method of apportioning adopted should be
	<br><blockquote><p>"such as appears to the Board or, on an appeal, to the Commissioners concerned to be just and reasonable".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0791">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>413</span>
It would be unfortunate if, because of the difficulties he has referred to, the Minister considered this and then said "We cannot find a way of doing this which does not let in other little bits and pieces, minnows or whales, whitebait or weaver fish", that he did not want to slip through and theefore be excluded payments made under Section 52 agreements. I hope that the sort of thing my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) has referred to could be included, that is, as expenditure which would be eligible if incurred afterwards. If there was any doubt, perhaps we could include some form of appeal procedure at this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman wishes an apportionment and an appeal procedure, and this would make the legislation even more complicated. That is the difficulty that one is labouring under. I take what he says, that we might look at this and find a way, but we shall have to consider it. It is not an easy matter to resolve, and I do not want hon. Members to think that on Report we shall be able to introduce a clause which will cover all kinds of situations. We certanly hope to meet the hon. Member on Section 52.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked for examples of expenditure that could come in if we accepted the words "in connection with". It is a trifle unfair to ask anyone to give examples of what might be described as being "in connection with" an acquisition. All sorts of situations could be argued to be "in connection with" an acquisition. For instance, to give just three examples, applications for abortive planning permission elsewhere could be said in some circumstances to be in connection with this acquisition because it had some connection with it. Secondly, what about the general overheads of the developer? If he had to employ certain people for a length of time on the acquisition, could that be said to be "in connection with" the acquisition? It probably could. Thirdly, searching for sites might be said to be "in connection with" the acquisition. It is difficult to put some kind of limitation on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not those types of expenditure be disqualified if we were talking about expenditure that would be eligible only if it were incurred after acquisition? We are concerned here with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>414</span>
the timing of the expenditure rather more than with the type of expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that helps, either. It would be difficult to grame legislation to take into account that kind of situation. The best course is for me to look at this again, to see whether we can at least extend it a little to take into account genuine cases, without letting in all kinds of other cases that would come in their trail if we were to extend it too widely. I cannot say any more than that that to the Committee. We shall certainly look at it again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for elaborating. I did not mean to be unfair to him, but the eliciting of his reply is of help to us. It shows that he is not trying to exclude bona fide expenditure which may be related. We have the problem of definition over whether it is actually incurred before or after the date of acquisition. I do not know whether the words "wholly and exclusively" or "specifically", or any of these other wicked tautologous terms that have floated around the Committee in earlier stages, need to be considered. But the point is well made, and certainly I welcome the Minister of State's response to the point I raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, we shall reserve our position to see what the Minister comes back with, and we very much hope he will come back with something to meet this important point. But, in the light of what he has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 75, page 94, line 26, after 'enhancing', insert 'or seeking to enhance'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an amendment of some importance, and I regard it as being a kind of two-part amendment. In part it is a probing amendment about what is included as eligible expenditure or expenditure on improvements, and in part it is a straight amendment—or whatever the reverse of a probing one is called.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is eligible to be excluded? It is not clear to me from reading either the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0792">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>415</span>
clause or the Explanatory Notes, which are pretty brief, other than saying that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Expenditure of a recurrent nature such as maintenance is excluded."</p></blockquote>
Defining maintenance as expenditure of a recurrent nature is somewhat strange method of definition to my mind, but it may be that no better one is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Certain specific types of expenditure have been referred to. Demolition is one that has come up on a number of points. The Multiple Shops Federation is worried about it, and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and the Housebuilders Federation have mentioned it. The critical factor on demolition is that if there is site with a very old and dilapidated building on it which has office user, and it is knocked down, the site is probably then worth less than if the building had been left on it if it was capable of being modernised and adapted to office use. So a site can actually be devalued by demolition, but demolition is clearly a necessary action precedent to a rebuilding which will lead to modern premises that will meet current needs. Thus, demolition is an important element in question here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other examples. One mentioned by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors can lead to quite considerable expenditure—namely, the cost of providing alternative accommodation for any tenant necessarily displaced. One should not jump to the conclusion that we are talking here about the rehousing of residential tenants exclusively, though that is something that could well be involved in a scheme. From my personal knowledge of a company for whose development programme I used to be responsible, I take pleasure in recording the number of people we rehoused in far better accommodation, often in places where they would rather be. This was on the principle that if one bought a site on which was condemned property—as, on a number of occasions, there was—which was occupied, one would seek accommodation which was suitable and attractive to the tenants and would offer it to them as an alternative at a rent, guaranteed for life or the longer of two lives if there were husband and wife, no greater than the rent that they were then paying. In many cases that would have been a rent controlled at a low level. In that way one could spend £10,000, £12,000, even £15,000 per head or per family in finding
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>416</span>
alternative accommodation to enable the development to take place. I put it to the Minister that this should be eligible expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the problem, not only of the residential tenant, but of commercial and industrial development schemes where partial rehousing of the user is necessary and very expensive, either in connection with either the carrying out of the scheme or the phasing of the scheme. I query whether this also would be eligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other categories of expenditure a number of which the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has drawn to our attention, and which I commend to the Minister's attention, from the Institution's wide experience. It mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"any costs actually incurred in complying with the conditions of planning permission, or with any agreement with the planning authority, for instance in the provision of, or contributions to, infrastructures, in the provision of land or finances for community facilities …"</p></blockquote>
—this is quite a common circumstance in these days and can involve substantial sums of money—
	<br><blockquote><p>"or in losses on buildings, costing more than their market value which are provided on land other than the land disposed".</p></blockquote>
This again is a characteristic feature of a comprehensive or larger scale development where the developer, as part of his scheme, might provide facilities which the local authority regarded as desirable. I know, for example, of cases where hotels in provincial towns have been provided at a cost greatly in excess of the actual market value of the hotel on completion as part of a package deal which included the development of stores, even for good rent payers such as the Co-op. These features suggest, all need to be taken into account. It is not immediately clear from a reading of the schedule or the explanatory notes whether they are allowable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the probing part of the amendment. The straight part, so to speak, relates to abortive work. The wording that we seek to include, "seeking to enhance", would clearly allow expenditure incurred that would have been eligible expenditure if it had actually enhanced the value, but there may regrettably be occasions when the work is carried out and it does not actually enhance the value. If the schedule is left as it is now worded, and a misguided or ill-advised judgment were made and expenditure made which did not, in fact, result in enhancing the value, one could
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0793">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>417</span>
find that expenditure disallowed. The obvious example is the appeal which fails. It could be very expensive—appeals have been known to cost £50,000 or more—and could result in the subsequent grant of planning permission for a modified or reduced scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have earlier heard examples—my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) cited a number from his wide and long experience—where the Secretary of State, in his final comments on an inspector's report on an appeal, has said that he agreed with the inspector in disallowing the appeal, but if the applicant were to come back with the front doors painted blue or a different alignment of the service road or whatever, he would hope that that scheme would be given approval. The considerable expenditure on the first appeal would, as far as I can see, be disallowed unless we changed the wording in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could also be occasions when one has expensive work on extensions to premises which may have been justified in their commercial or industrial judgment, taking the matter as a whole, but where the market value of the additional accommodation provided by the extension would be worth far less than the actual cost of carrying out the extension. I am not sure what is the position, but if we have the words "seeking to enhance" there could be no doubt that the project venture would be allowed. Therefore, I hope that this amendment will not only be regarded as helpful, but so helpful that it can be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall refer to the probing part of the amendment, as put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), since this enables us to discuss the meaning of enhancing in this context. Since the form of words used in Schedule 3(2), which says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"…any work of maintenance, repair or decoration or any similar work…"</p></blockquote>
is described as being of "a recurrent nature" and is not regarded as an expenditure on improvements, that suggests that the interest in land relates to an existing structure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise with the Minister the meaning of enhancing in this context. If one were dealing not with an interest in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>418</span>
land which involved an existing building but with development land without buildings on it, or on which buildings had already been demolished, it would be open to question what is meant by the phrase "enhancement of value". After all, if one has an open site which, in its existing state, is ready for development, which development, for various reasons, cannot take place for a period of time, were the site allowed to lie idle for a considerable time, it may deteriorate in value because it might be used, for instance, as a rubbish tip. In removing the rubbish, one would be enhancing the lower value which subsequently applied to the land being used as a rubbish tip. One would not necessarily be enhancing that value above the original value. In that sense, it culd be regarded as a form of enhancement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be helpful if the Minister, in his reply, could explain whether the clause, as drafted, is principally designed to relate to existing buildings, whether in drafting the clause the case of bare land was taken into account and also whether enhancement of the value of that interest means enhancement of the starting value or could include the restoration of the value, not on any basis of recurrent maintenance but on the basis of necessary expenditure undertaken, perhaps once, twice or whenever needed, in order to maintain the value of that site for subsequent development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a matter of some importance in the interpretation of this schedule, I raise the question of the meaning of the word "enhance". "Enhance" is a fancy word. It might mean "enchanting" in this Bill if one were to put the letter "c" before "h", and the letter "t" before "i". The simpleton who wrote the explanatory notes put a different interpretation on it. He says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"adding to the value of that interest."</p></blockquote>
If it means adding to the value, it means adding to the value. If it means enhancing the value, it means enhancing the value. But what does "enhancing" mean in this sense? It is a strange word to use. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove raised an important point here. One may, as one thinks, enhance the value without adding to the value. If one removed rubbish, for instance, it might enhance the value but it would not necessarily add to it. The amendment is very important. It is also
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0794">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>419</span>
important, if "to enhance" does not mean to add, that the Bill should say what it does mean.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could deal first with the probing part of the amendment. A number of cases were put and a number of examples were given. Having practised at the Bar for about nine years, before my present incarnation, I discovered very early not to give advice unless I had all the facts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And a fee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One's clerk dealt with that part of the situation. I therefore find it extremely difficult professionally to give advice here in relation to cases thrown at me across the Committee without knowing the full facts of the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister knows the definition of an advocate's or barrister's clerk. It is somebody who helps you to get what is coming to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that definition entirely.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we shall not pursue this too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked what "enhancing" meant. The word "enhancing" comes from the capital gains tax legislation. I have no doubt that it has been used in planning legislation as well as in fiscal legislation and has a more or less clear meaning in case law. Again, we come back to the old problem. Of course, one could use other words. One could say "increase the value", I suppose, or even "add to the value". But then this creates more uncertainty. It might create more litigation. When words have been used and pronounced upon by the courts, as the hon. and learned Gentleman will appreciate very well, it is wise and sensible not to depart from that language, if it has been commented on and accepted and its meaning more or less understood, because language is not precise although hon. Members opposite seem sometimes to suggest that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the probing points, having uttered the 	<i>caveat</i> that I would need all the facts before being able to pronounce
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>420</span>
in every particular case. Perhaps I may set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest in relation to demolition or, indeed, clearing rubbish tips, I suppose, in most cases. If the demolition enhances the value of the land, if one knocks down old buildings to make way for a development, for instance, and by getting rid of the buildings this improves the value of the land, and if that is also
	<br><blockquote><p>"reflected in the state of the land"</p></blockquote>
—as it would be in most cases—then, of course, that kind of expenditure is covered by the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two parts to this:
	<br><blockquote><p>"enhancing the value of that interest, being expenditure reflected in the state of the land".</p></blockquote>
I think that in most cases it would be fairly clear whether the situation fell within that language.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cost of rehousing, again, in most cases would be covered by the legislation, because it would include the market value of the land being developed. So I can reassure the hon. Gentleman on that point, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then gave a number of examples which seemed in the main to be infrastructure expenses. Again, if they are infrastructure expenses which enhance the value and are reflected in the state of the land—there may be some expenses which are not reflected in the actual state of the land, but I should have thought that most infrastructure expenses would be so reflected—they would also be covered by this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see what the Minister is trying to say, but it does not necessarily follow. I gave the instance where permission is granted to carry out a development that comprises shops, offices and a hotel because the local authority is anxious to have a modern hotel in its town centre, but the hotel will cost more to build than the market value on completion. What is reflected in the state of the land at the end of the operation is the completed, shops, offices and hotels. But the hotel is actually worth less than it cost to build. What I am asking is whether, as the hotel has had to be built at a cost in excess of its value, it can be reflected in the valuation of the other parts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that the question was, what cost can be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0795">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>421</span>
brought in for the improvement? I do not think that any other costs can be brought in other than those of constructing the hotel. For certain reasons, it may be worth less than it cost to build, but I should not have thought, in fiscal legislation, that one could have a different cost from the actual cost incurred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make it clear. The problem would arise if the resulting interest in the shops and offices were to be disposed of and the relevant interest would not include the hotel, but it would have been part of the cost of development in the same way as an infrastructure cost of the type to which he referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I have to build a hotel in order to build shops and offices and the cost of building that hotel is part of the cost of building the shops and offices, I do not see why I should be able to obtain special extra costs in relation to that. If it is costly to develop such shops and offices, no doubt the developer will reflect the costs of erecting the hotel in reaching his profit margin. This would be costed before he entered into the development. If it costs him a lot to build an hotel in order to build shops and offices, it will be part of the cost. I should have thought that it entered into the cost of computation for the purposes of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then came to a specific point in relation to what he called "abortive work"—work which might not be reflected in the value of the land. The answer to that is "No, he cannot give a reduction for work not reflected in the value of the land". If it is abortive work it does not create the value and that value is not taxed. If the improvement, or embarking on the work, does not enhance the value because it is not possible to go through with it, I do not see why that sort of cost should be allowable either. If we started giving relief for abortive work, all sorts of work could be brought in. If it is not reflected in the value of the land, taxation does not arise. I do not see that it is fair to be allowed that cost when that cost has not created a taxable situation as regards increasing the value of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the amendment is aimed in that direction, we cannot go along with it because it would bring in cases of abortive
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>422</span>
work and we could not possible agree to include these costs in computing the tax for the purposes of this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for explaining, the matters which he thinks would be included within the improvements which would be enhancing the value of the interest in the land, such as demolition, the cost of rehousing and infrastructure expenses. But I was most disappointed with the latter half of his speech when he said that the abortive expenses would not be included. There are some serious expenses which many developers will have laid out in the hope of improving the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) referred to the question of applications for planning permission when great expense may be incurred in taking the application to appeal, with the appeal being refused in the end. How shall we apply the position as the Bill is drafted?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman gave the case of the abortive application for planning permission. If the application were abortive, the development would not arise and presumably development land tax does not arise either, because planning permission was not given in respect of the land for which application was made. Therefore, I do not see how the hon. Gentleman can argue that the costs of that application should be set against tax. There is nothing to set it against.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hove explained what he meant by the example which he gave. He went on to say that if, on appeal, the original planning permission is refused but nevertheless indication is given of the type of permission which would be granted if the application is renewed, as the Bill is now drafted, one might have to take into account only the very small expenditure on putting in the second application. It would involve merely copying the last paragraph in the Secretary of State's letter, resubmitting the application and the granting of permission without expenditure on surveying, valuing, and legal costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet the expenditure on the original application would have been made in an
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0796">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>423</span>
effort to enhance the value of the interest. It will be difficult to decide what enhances the value of the interest when the developer or the owner of the land produces his account of his expenses in an attempt to increase the value of the land. We argue that, because a man spends money on painting the door blue, that has not enhanced the value, he should have painted it red, expenditure on the blue paint will not be taken into account at all because the property would have sold for a better price had the door beed painted red.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have used these rather stupid examples, but there may well be cases in which there has been substantial expenditure on seeking to add to the value of the interest without complete success. Are we to split the expenditure, for example? A considerable amount of expenditure might have been laid out in improving two parts of the land, or the building, or whatever the interest may be. That expenditure may not have been successful on one part in increasing the value: on the other part it may have been quite successful. Do we apportion that out as regards the amount of the enhancement of value on one part of the property and on the other?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the expenditure reflects an honest effort to increase the value of the interest for the purpose of disposing of it, even if it is not altogether successful in enhancing that value, nevertheless it is an expenditure for the purpose of improvement, if not quite within the term of the heading of the schedule of expenditure on improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Revenue ought to take advantage of the fact that expenditure has not been wholly successful in increasing the value of the interest. The Revenue should take into account the objective of the expenditure and the amount that has been expended, no matter what the increase in value to the property may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will think again about this. It may well be that the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"or seeking to enhance the value of that interest"</p></blockquote>
is not quite the right phrase. The Opposition have questioned the word "enhance". Although the word has been used in previous legislation, I am not sure that it is really what we are after. In the explanatory note, the phrase "adding to the value" seems more appropriate and understandable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>424</span>
However, there is a real problem here. I do not think that the amendment, which has been well proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove, is in any way a drafting or probling amendment. It is a substantial amendment which might have far-reaching effects upon the expenditure to be allowed under Schedule 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the Minister's dual defence of the word "enhance", as having been immemorially inscribed in statute law and the subject of judicial interpretation. Therefore, in the brief time at my disposal, I consulted the various dictionaries of definition of words and phrases. In the books in the limited law library, including Butterworth, the word "enhance" has never been judicially defined. Of course, that is not necessarily exclusive, but it is a word of doubtful meaning and I was not quite sure which way the Minister was jumping. It is important to know whether he imagines the word "enhance" to have one of those meanings. As defined in the Oxford Dictionary, it means to raise or increase in price, value, importance or attractiveness—which are not equivalent. One might increase an object in value if one increases it in attractiveness, or makes it appear greater in any of those commodities; in other words, makes it appear so, even if it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister for a more definitive example than "planning permission". Supposing one builds an hotel on a piece of land for which there is also planning permission for housing. The hotel, having been built, could not be let to anyone, but, as a result of its being there, no one was willing to develop the land for housing. One would have indulge in considerable expenditure in building the hotel, which decreased the value because one would have frustrated the housing developing by getting the initial decision wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we should take into line the two categories: one is a frustrated attempt to increase the value—and I use the word "increase" because "enhance" has too many meanings—or a misjudged attempt to increase the value which has, in fact, decreased the value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Obviously the drafting will have to be done carefully, but it seems to me—and I hope the Minister is sympathetic—that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0797">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>425</span>
where there is expenditure which 	<i>de facto,</i> although not 	<i>de jure</i> or 	<i>de animo,</i> decreases the value, or is frustrated in an attempt to increase the value, in all equity that expenditure should be taken into account under the schedule. I hope the Minister will look at this again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will be able to say something a little more encouraging. My right hon. Friend said that the wording we have used may not be right. The Minister gave an encouraging response on what has been included, but he has been discouraging on two points. The first, on the planning application taken to appeal and refused, which is a paving to a subsequent grant and approval, needs to be looked at. The second point was the case of total development, which includes an element which has a lower market value than its cost. If subsequently the other parts of the development are sold, is the excess of cost over value of that element to be allowed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"reflected in the state of land in which that interest subsists".</p></blockquote>
The explanatory notes confirm that subsection (3) is there because of that phraseology. One needs paragraph (3) only because the planning permission has a requirement relating to other land. That other land would be excluded by the inclusion in paragraph 1(1)(	<i>a</i>) of the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"state of the land in which that interest subsists".</p></blockquote>
The case I have outlined is similar to that covered in paragraph 3, but paragraph 3 refers only to a
	<br><blockquote><p>"condition regulating the development or use of other land".</p></blockquote>
It does not cover the circumstances to which I have referred. Perhaps the Minister would look further at this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said that this was a substantial amendment. It is substantial and would lead to substantial consequences. We cannot draw the line between one form or abortive expenditure and another. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the refusal of planning permission and later reapplication which did not involve any work and said that he would like to include that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>426</span>
situation. Is that the only situation that he wants to include? Is he saying that we should draft to cover just that situation? We cannot. There is nowhere one could draw the line in relation to abortive expenditure, if that expenditure is not reflected in the value of the land.

The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) helped me considerably by giving me a definition of "enhancing" which, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is "raising" or "increasing". If it is enhancing the value in this legislation, that means raising or increasing the value. draftsman obviously also has the Oxford Dictionary to hand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, I read out the full meaning. It also means appearing to raise. Thus one is appearing to raise it, even if one does not raise it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The requirement is clearly that the value should have been raised, otherwise there is no entitlement. That deals with the point of enhancing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendment, but we cannot go that far. Many of these expenditures in relation to a developer or a trader will be allowable against the general corporation tax situation. We are concerned here only with the profit on betterment. When we come to the development—the building—the building costs are expenses which would, if they were wholly and exclusively incurred, be allowable in the general way against corporation tax or income tax as general overheads which would be deductible in relation to corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I do not want to commit myself, in practice, most of the cases mentioned of abortive expenditure in relation to the value of the land would be deductible from profits in general in relation to the profits of development. We are concerned here with betterment and with taxing betterment and betterment value. If cost and expenditure do not increase or affect betterment value, I fail to see how we can allow cost and expenditure as a deduction against betterment value. In most cases, it would be deductible in computing corporation tax or income tax which the developer will pay on his development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I cannot meet the hon. Gentleman. It would be easy to say that we shall look at it and then look at it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0798">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>427</span>
rather perfunctorily, but that is not the right way of deal with the Committee. I cannot say to the Committee that we shall look at this because there are great difficulties in drawing the line. I am sorry I cannot do this, but it would not be fair to the Committee if I said that I could. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his amendment, but, if he feels that he has to press it to a Division, it will be decided in the normal manner.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a difficult matter, but the Minister has rather implied that if the line could be drawn just to include the bits which we have said should be included and exclude the others, he would be much more sympathetic. What seems to be worrying him is what might be brought in by the wording of the amendment. He may have representations from local authorities which wish to include conditions in leases to developers on one aspect of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best thing to do would be to reserve our position and to try to find some other wording which was more narrowy drawn and would find favour in the Minister's eyes. I shall therefore not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 97, in page 94, line 36, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'unless that work is carried out solely to enable the disposal of the interest'.</p></blockquote>
This amendment deals with subparagraph (2) of paragraph 1, a subparagraph which provides that expenditure incurred in carrying out
	<br><blockquote><p>"maintenance, repair or decoration or any similar work of a recurrent nature is not expenditure on improvements."</p></blockquote>
There are many occasions when expenditure is incurred on items which normally would be called repair or maintenance but the work is carried out for the purpose of disposing of the property. The whole point of the tax is that it falls when there is a disposal of property. Therefore, if the owner is enabling the property to be disposed of more quickly and more advantageously by carrying out certain repairs to it, I should have thought that those works should be allowable expenditure under the schedule. That is recognised in other tax provisions when money has been spent entirely on, if I may so call it, tarting
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>428</span>
up a property to sell it and the expenditure is directly connected with the disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am hoping that the Minister will say that the amendment is unnecessary and that the provision exists by the use of the word "recurrent". If "recurrent" means anything, it means doing something again and again. In the amendment, I am talking about work done once and for all in order to dispose of a property. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will say that the amendment is unnecessary, and that expenditure directly connected with the disposal of a property is already excluded from the subparagraph by the use of the word "recurrent".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my right hon. Friend, and I shall give another example. If I buy a property which is in a bad state of repair, the price paid reflects the fact that it is in a bad state of repair. Therefore, the initial work which I should have to carry out, although it might normally be classified as maintenance, should be reflected in base value on a subsequent disposal or deemed disposal. Again, it may be that the word "recurrent" covers this particular situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman hoped that the wording proposed in the amendment would not be necessary. I believe that I can give him that assurance, although not for the reason that he indicated, that is, not because the word "recurrent" occurs in the subparagraph.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that most of the expenditure which may be termed current rather than capital expenditure, or revenue expenditure, if I may use a taxation term—it is more akin to revenue expenditure than to capital expenditure—would be included in the current use value of the land at the time of disposal. If a person was maintaining a property reasonably well, the cost of maintenance would be reflected in the current use value in the same way as repairs to the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The example given by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) was of a property bought in a bad state and improved and repaired, being brought up to a better state. Those expenses would be reflected in the current use value. The current use value of the land would be greater due to the current expenditure. So there would be a deduction because the current use value is the basis of liability or the basis of computing liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0799">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>429</span>
I think, therefore, that I can give the assurance that in most cases—an exception may occur—this kind of expenditure would be reflected in current use value, enhancing the base value and thereby reducing taxation when property comes to be disposed of for the purposes of DLT. I hope that hon. Members will accept the assurance that there would be no taxation in relation to these forms of current expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure that I follow the Minister's argument. If he is right in saying that expenditure of this kind will be reflected in the current use value, surely that argument would apply to the previous provisions we have been discussing, and therefore the expenditure on improvements would be reflected in the current use value. So why do we have it at all? Can it not all be dealt with on that basis? In subparagraph (1), we are allowed to bring in the actual expenditure on improvements, and in subparagraph (2) I was seeking to do exactly the same in so far as the repairs and so on are carried out solely to enable the disposal of the interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fact, I have drawn the amendment very tightly. One would have to show only that the work was carried out solely to enable the disposal of the interest. so it would be very difficult to have tax avoidance or evasion here. It still seems a very reasonable point that the actual expenditure should be included, not merely what might be an increase in current use value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I cannot persuade the Minister, I shall see if I can reword the amendment on another occasion, but now I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 76, in page 35, line 49, leave out paragraph 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very dubious paragraph, and I see no reason for including it. I suspect that once again we see the obsession with evasion or avoidance, and that is the reason it has been included. I fail to see why the subsequent variation of a condition which has been allowed as affecting value, without any reference in this subparagraph to the circumstances in which
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>430</span>
that variation has occurred, should mean that the whole original valuation has to be reopened, and a sort of clawback comes in. I can visualise numerous circumstances—both sides of the Committee would support me in not going into them at length now—in which subsequent events affecting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman's</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that seven Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seven Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Even with a larger audience, I shall resist the temptation to go at length into these examples. But I assure the Minister that there are many circumstances where new events would arise—perhaps new bits of land would come in—which would lead to a variation of one of the conditions that would have been allowed originally in paragraph 3. If it was proper to make the allowance originally, why should it suddenly be necessary to withdraw it.?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another aspect of this which may not have been appreciated. If there were ever a case involving the use of paragraph 3, on the death of the land owner involved in such a case, his estate could not be wound up automatically until six years had elapsed, which would seem likely to be extremely inconvenient. One would have to wait six years, because it could mean quite a major change if at some subsequent stage there was a variation of the conditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason for including this paragraph. It seems solely concerned with some obsession with evasion or avoidance. I cannot imagine how it could be used in that way, but I can envisage many occasions when there would be a quite proper variation and nothing whatever to do with the original circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could take the Committee back to paragraph 3, which is the forerunner of paragraph 5. It is in relation to paragraph 3 that one must look at the kind of variation which could happen under paragraph 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3 is aimed to give the taxpayer a relief which he otherwise would not get in relation to a particular situation which could arise as follows. Let us say
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0800">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>431</span>
that the taxpayer had two properties, property A and property B. Property A had been a residential house which was then used, with planning permission, as an office building. The taxpayer then asked the local authority for permission to develop property B, which again was a residential house, and turn it into an office building. The local authority might agree to the development of property B provided that the planning permission on property A was given up and provided property A reverted from offices to residential property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By getting planning permission on property B its value is enhanced, but the taxpayer loses something in relation to his property A. The condition is that the permission on property A is given up in order to acquire permission for property B.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the legislation is drafted, without paragraph 3 that person would not get any relief when he disposed of the second property by reason of the fact that he got permission for the second property through giving up the condition on the first property. In other words, he is losing something. He got the extra value in relation to property B by giving up something in relation to property A. Without paragraph 3 he would not have that benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into the details of how it is computed, but paragraph 3 gives him that benefit by deducting from his current use value in relation to property B the diminution in property A as a result of the revocation or loss of planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It could happen in the next six years that there might be a variation again in relation to property A. In other words, it could revert within that time to an office building, or partly to an office building. In that kind of situation there is an increase in the value of property A, and it is not right that within a period of six years the owner should get the whole tax relief when in fact he is again getting back something in relation to property A which was taken away from him. The object of paragraph 5 is to recompute the situation where there has been this kind of variation so that some of the tax is paid back within a period of six years. There is this six-year time limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and I see what he is getting at. But if, for perfectly good reasons, the local authority or planning authority decides five and a half years later
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>432</span>
to give planning permission to property A to return to office use, that in itself as a change of use could give rise to an assessment for development land tax. Why is it necessary to reopen the first case five and a half years before?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Because he has obtained credit for the fact that the property had depreciated in value. When the property increases in value again the credit is withdrawn. There is no question of taxing the person twice, but if he has received a credit which, as events turn out within six years, he should not have got because there is a change in the state of the first property, the tax is clawed back. That is the purpose of paragraph 5. It has nothing to do with avoidance. It is merely looking at the situation within a period of six years to see whether at the end of the six-year period the same situation applies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of a death and the fact that the estate could not be cleared up for six years. That might very well happen, but it happens anyway, as he appreciates, in relation to all sorts of taxation liabilities. Perhaps in the case of a death the time should be reduced to three years or some other period. But with taxation generally executors have to spend some time to clear up estate duty problems, for instance. There may be all sorts of difficulties in relation to taxation on the winding up of an estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that this is an additional burden on an executor, but paragraph 5 is not aimed at tax avoidance. The purpose is to withdraw a credit which was given in the first place but should not have been given, taking the circumstances as they are six years later, because the property had increased again in value. In those circumstances, we do not think it right that the credit should stand.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This really is an excess of caution. Will there be all that number of cases which will make it worth while employing so many more people at the Inland Revenue? We heard in the Budget Speech yesterday how many are employed there on matters which are not important. Here there would be a search for occasions when the taxpayer happens to have received a credit as much as five years and 364 days ago and he is suddenly having it clawed back. Is it really worth
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0801">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>433</span>
all the trouble and inconvenience of keeping accounts open for all that time and carrying out unnecessary work at the Revenue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worst occasion, of course, will be as a result of death where the personal representatives will have to keep the estate open. They cannot distribute it. They have to make some provision for this, such as taking out an insurance policy. They have to keep the estate going for six years. The Minister has given some indication that he will think again about this matter. If he can give some relief, at least we may have achieved something out of this amendment. To leave the Bill as it stands will be a gross inconvenience in the administration of estates and, indeed, it will inconvenience many developers and landowners for no real purpose. There will be a minute reclaim of tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I knew that I did not pick the figure of three years out of the air. It comes from the Taxes Management Act 1970. I can reassure the right hon. Gentleman that in relation to a death the period would be three years, because the Taxes Management Act 1970 supersedes other legislation. In income tax the assessment is normally six years. I am told that it will be three years in this case and not six years. Therefore, it will be a shorter period than I indicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that read into the Bill without our mentioning anything about it in this schedule? None of us on the Conservative side of the Committee who have had a little experience in tax work spotted the fact that we have got to read that into the schedule. I think we could, perhaps, introduce something which would give the layman some clue that he is getting a little relief out of this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that the administrative provisions of the Bill are subject to the Taxes Management Act 1970, and although I would not want to go into the later schedules I think we will find that it is there. However, if it is not and the matter is not clear, then we will make it clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what the Minister has said, I think we would be wise to study the matter again and, if necessary, come back later.

	<div class='title'>FURTHER ADDITION TO BASE A</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>7.—(1) In determining base A of an interest in land in a case where subsection (4A) of section 5 of this Act applies, the further amount referred to in that subsection is that given by the formula—</p>
	<p>RI x A/C</p>
	<p>where "RI", "A", and "C" have the meanings assigned to them by sub-paragraph (2) below.</p>
	<p>(2) The constituents of the formula in subparagraph (1) above are derived from the several amounts which, in accordance with paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (1) of section 5 of this Act, are included in the aggregate referred to in that paragraph, so that—</p>
	<p>"C" is the amount so included by virtue of sub-paragraph (i) of that paragraph;</p>
	<p>"RI" is the amount so included by virtue of sub-paragraph (ii) of that paragraph; and</p>
	<p>"A" is the amount so included by virtue of sub-paragraph (iv) of that paragraph'.—[	<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Third Schedule to the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point has arisen which should have occurred to me esrlier. On reading through the schedule I note that paragraph 2 deals with "expenditure on relevant improvements". I wonder why one has to define the expenditure that is allowed by reference to changes in the current use value, when case C in Clause 5 does not bring in current use value at all? Surely it is wrong to make this all-embracing when relevant improvements come in in case C but not current use value. Should not that be looked at?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other cases deal with current use value. Paragraph 2 sets out the way that relevant improvements are computed. They are computed by taking all improvements and then deducting therefrom
	<br><blockquote><p>"a sum equal to the amount by which … the current use value of the relevant interest has increased the result of the expenditure on improvements."</p></blockquote>
The intention of this is to exclude deduction twice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, there could be improvements which would increase current use
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0802">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>435</span>
value and increase development value. For example expenditure incurred by a farmer in putting drainage on his land could include current use value and it could be very beneficial on a development. Paragraph 2 merely sets out the way in which one arrives at the element of improvement by deducting the one figure from the other. It applies, of course, to bases A and B as well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>7.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One point arises on paragraph 3, where the chargeable person will get credit when planning permission is granted
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to a condition regulating the development or use of other land".</p></blockquote>
As the Bill is drafted, it will only be when that condition is contained in a planning permission. On other occasions we have discussed the conditions which may be applied outside the planning permission, such as the Section 52 and other agreements with local authorities, statutory undertakers, Government Departments, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minsiter would look at this to see whether this paragraph is not too restrictive as drafted. Frequently the alternative to putting a condition into the planning permission is an agreement between the authorities and the developer. I think everyone wants to encourage that sort of agreement. It would be cut out of this Schedule unless there is a slight amendment to that affect. I think that the schedule is intended to cover that, and I hope that the Minister will have another look at it from that point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think there might be an explanation of the difference between
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>436</span>
"relevant improvements" and "improvements". Can the Minister help by putting something into the definition clause or making it a little clearer? The phrases are so close together that it is not immediately clear why this difference should be necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a difference. I accept that, on first reading, that difference may not be clear. The difference is that "improvements" are improvements in general, which can be improvements to current use value and to development value. "Relevant improvements" are improvements to development value. But I accept that, as drafted, the differences between the two may not be immediately apparent. We will look at that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point that the hon. Gentleman made is a very fair point. As drafted, the paragraph does not include the kind of obligation to which he referred. It merely includes the depreciation of property through denial of or taking away planning permission. We shall certainly look to see whethre it is possible to amend the paragraph to include other obligations which depress the value of property A, thereby enhancing the value of property B.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
