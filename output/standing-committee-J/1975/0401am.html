PROJECTS OF MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 37, in page 71, line 15, leave out from 'relates' to end of line 16.<br><br>
This amendment seeks to leave out the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"and the time of the grant of that permission shall be treated as the time at which that project is begun."</p></blockquote>
In paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 we are dealing with the cases where there has been a grant of planning permission for a limited period—that is, the use of property for a certain purpose has been allowed for a limited period and, when that period runs out, this paragraph takes effect to decide whether the renewal of permission for the use is a project of material development.<br><br>
In order to explain the reason for seeking to omit the words, the paragraph provides that if any material development is carried out in accordance with planning permission which was granted after 12th September 1974 for a limited period, and subsequently the planning permission was granted for the retention of that use on the land, then
<br><blockquote><p>"the retention or continued use … shall be treated as constituting a project of material development consisting of a material change in the use of the land to which the planning permission referred … and the time of the grant of that permission shall be treated as the time at which that project is begun."</p></blockquote>
As I read the paragraph, the grant of that permission may be either the original grant or the extension of it. If it is the original grant and if the matter is to date back to that date, it may be disadvantageous to the developer and he ought to have a chance to query that.<br><br>
Most of our amendments to Schedule 1 seek to give as much discretion to the developer as possible in deciding the date on which a specified operation starts. The
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 196</span>
date on which a developer's project starts make a very great difference to him because it may make a difference to the amount of development value on which he will be charged tax in any financial year and, secondly, it is important for the developer to be able to choose the area of the project. I do not mean that he should be able to go against the law completely in his choice, but he should be able to choose which project is starting when he has a number of phased projects to carry out.<br><br>
The amendment covers the point that a developer should not necessarily be tied to a mandatory provision such as this, because one must take the time of the grant of that permission as the time at which the project is begun. It may be that the Minister will be able to explain that my fears are unfounded, but I think it would be a much easier paragraph to administer both from the Revenue's point of view and that of the developer if the words were omitted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) on a point of principle which he raised, when he said that our object was to try to give as wide as possible a discretion to developers and builders so that they would be able to fix their tax point at a point satisfactory and even advantageous to them. There is nothing wrong in that. It is not a question of our wishing to give them an unfair advantage. Anyone dealing in land over the past few years has had to do so in a highly cyclical market. I am not trying to blame the present Government for all that has happened, but land dealers have had to pass through a period of high boom into one of low recession. That state of affairs has been complicated by frequent changes in taxation.<br><br>
One of the ways in which such entrepreneurs can survive is to have some latitude in the fixing of their tax liability. That means that to some extent, by evening out their tax liability, they can even out the falls and the rises in the general activity in their sector of the economy, too.<br><br>
It is a perfectly reasonable attitude for us to take towards them in respect of all the arguments concerning the schedule. We hope that the Minister will at least accept the general philosophy that it is right to try to give these particular entre-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0675">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 197</span>
preneurs as wide a discretion as possible. They need it to enable them to survive. This has always been a cyclical industry. Apart from farmers, the figures for bankruptcy are always higher in the building industry than in any other trade. I suggest that there is nothing wrong so far as other taxpayers are concerned in giving this sector of the community this discretion, and certainly nothing wrong in respect of the ¼ million people now unemployed in the building industry. The proposal makes sense. It is also just.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury [Mr. Denzil Davies]</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), in moving the amendment, set out correctly the purpose of the sub-paragraph and of the amendment. The words of the amendment relate to a situation in which there is a grant of planning permission for a limited period, say, for five years. Then, at some point between year one and year five, renewal of that planning permission for possibly a longer limited period, or even a permanent period, is granted by the local authority.<br><br>
The Bill provides that, at the time of the granting of renewal of planning permission, be that in year two or year four, the developer is treated as having started another project of development so that a development land tax charge falls at that point in relation to the next limited period. We believe that that is the right way of looking at the issue. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that there is no intention of going back, as it were, to the beginning of the original planning permission. There will not be a charge going right back to the beginning of year one. The charge will arise in relation to the point where the local authority gives the developer a further period of planning permission, be it in year one, year two, year three or year four, during the period of the first planning permission.<br><br>
The intention of the legislation is that at that point, when planning permission for renewal is given, we consider that the developer is acquiring another asset, perhaps not an asset in the technical sense, but he has acquired a valuable right. The legislation is based on the assumption that the developer is getting something valuable, and at that point a charge against it arises, and the spreading provisions apply as they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 198</span>
do generally.<br><br>
I take some of the right hon. Gentleman's points. If the amendment were accepted, I understand that the charge would not arise until the termination of the first limited period. In other words, if the permission was for five years and there was a renewal of permission in year four, under the Bill the charge would arise in relation to year four. If the amendment were accepted, the charge would arise at the end of year five, at the termination of the first period.<br><br>
This is not a matter where we want to stick rigidly to the legislation, and I am quite happy to recommend to the Committee that we should accept at least the principle of the amendment; that the charge is not triggered off until the termination of the limited period. At present it would be triggered off by the actual granting of planning permission by the local authority. No revenue loss is involved here. The right hon. Gentleman's suggestions may be thought fairer. There are arguments on both sides, but I am happy to accept the principle of the amendment. If it is necessary to make some amendments to his draft amendment we will do so, but I am happy to accept the situation where the charge will not arise until the end of the limited period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister for his statement on the amendment. I am beginning to think that my hon. Friend the Minister for Melton (Mr. Latham) was right the other day when he said we were getting a sort of love-in between the two sides of the Committee.<br><br>
This paragraph is retrospective, in a way, because it refers to a planning permission which has been granted before the appointed day and it may well have been that when that limited planning permission was applied for and granted the applicant was quite happy to allow it to be for a limited period by way of compromise with the local planning authority, not realisng that, if he did that, he might be letting himself in for some tax of which he knew nothing at the time and which is now embodied in the Bill.<br><br>
The applicant should be allowed to gain the whole advantage of what he agreed then. Perhaps he might not have agreed at that time and might have wished to argue it out further with the planning authority to give him permanent per-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0676">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 199</span>
mission. I am not sure that I agree with the principle of the paragraph, that the retention, or the continued use, gives him another asset which ought to fall for taxation under this Bill. I do not think it should. But if we accept the principle the Minister put forward, that on the extension or the renewal of that limited planning permission he gains another asset, he should at least get the whole of the asset which he already has for the whole of the period which is limited. If it is extended during the third or fourth year, he gets an allowance for the full period. That, in effect, would be one of the results of the amendment.<br><br>
I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will look into this point and that, on the whole, he agrees that the person who has the permission shall have the whole advantage of that permission before he is called upon to pay tax upon some further development value. On that basis, I would be happy to seek later to withdraw the amendment and see what the Minister is prepared to put down at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should just like to amplify one thing. I did not mean to imply—and I do not think it is implied—that there is any allowance given here. One is merely concerned with the point in time at which the charge arises in relation to the renewal or planning permission. The way the tax is computed and the values would be exactly the same. By accepting the amendment we would be accepting the proposition that the tax will not be charged until the end of the first limited period. But at the end of the day, as I understand it, there is no question of more or less tax being paid. It is just a case of the tax charge being slightly put forward if the limited planning permission is renewed early in the life of the first limited planning permission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a loose word which I used—"allowance". "Allowance in time" would have been a better expression to use.<br><br>
I am sure, Mr. Fitch, that you took what I said previously as an indication of my intention of asking for leave of the Committee to withdraw. I have not been deprived of that by further debate upon the matter. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 200</span>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 18, in Schedule 1, page 71, line 29, at end insert
<br><blockquote><p>'Provided always that the Board shall if so requested in a notice given under paragraph 36(1) of Schedule 8 certify the development and the land comprised in a project of material development by virtue of this paragraph'.</p></blockquote>
This is a fairly brief amendment. Under Schedule 1(4) it is defined that all land relevant to the project is to be assessed for that project. That is necessary to prevent avoidance by sub-division of plots. I make no complaint about that.<br><br>
Under Schedule 8(36)(1) a project of material development has to be notified to the Board of Inland Revenue between 60 days before and 30 days after its start.<br><br>
It is possible to envisage circumstances when the actual confines of the land involved in the project are open to dispute. I can think of several examples. It might be part of the next phase of an estate for which permission had not yet been given, although it was known that it was likely to be given by the usual nods and winks that occur in these matters between planning authorities and developers. Suppose that a sewer pipe had already been laid across it. Perhaps the site is sold by a receiver in the middle of that period of 90 days. It might be desirable for the creditors to be able to require from the Inland Revenue a clear statement of what land is involved in making an assessment of the assets of the company in the receivership before making any distribution to creditors.<br><br>
Those are two possible scenarios which occurred to me when I was considering the amendment. I have no doubt that there are others. Perhaps the Minister would consider the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has highlighted what I may describe as a difference between this legislation and the betterment levy legislation. I referred to that yesterday. Under the betterment levy legislation there was provision for notices and counter-notices to go back and forth between the Land Commission and the developer. This caused some complexity and made the practicalities of working out the legislation more complicated.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0677">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 201</span>
The object of this legislation and the notice under paragraph 36(1) of Schedule 8, which is the notice from the developer, is to try to keep the matter as simple as possible. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) earlier suggested that the developer should be given a discretion in determining in what areas he should start, when he should start and how he should effect the development. The requirement that a notice should be given by the developer—in most cases that is the end of the matter, subject to additional or new development—was inserted in the legislation for that purpose so that we would not be encumbered with notices going back and forth.<br><br>
The legislation is drawn so that, once a notice is received by the Board from the developer, in most cases—there obviously will be exceptions—that will be the end of the matter, at least until it may be later debated in relation to an assessment for the Commissioners. Generally, once a notice has been issued under paragraph 36(1), the Revenue will accept that notice, unless it is obvious that there is something wrong with it, and the developer can go ahead with his project.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman wishes the Inland Revenue to issue another notice if requested telling the developer "Yes, we agree that the land which you specified is the right land for the development." I can see that in certain cases it might be necessary for a developer to rely on the certainty of an approval. There will be correspondence. It will not happen simply by a form being sent in and that being the end of the matter. There will be correspondence and agreement. But the hon. Gentleman wants us to go further and impose an obligation upon the Board to send a counter notice if requested saying "Yes, we agree with the area of land described and the nature and scope of the project."<br><br>
I think that that would be a mistake. It would be a retrograde step which would make life more difficult in the majority of cases. I am not convinced that it would be in the best interests of operating legislation. As the legislation goes through the House, if it appears that this causes great difficulty, no doubt we can consider it again later. But, as far as I am aware, there have not been any representations on that score. No views have been expressed, as far as I know, that there should be some
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 202</span>
kind of counter-notice. At the moment, therefore, I am not disposed to go along with the hon. Gentleman and recommend acceptance of his amendment because it would make the whole machinery more cumbersome and lead to greater delay.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister does not like my hon. Friend's amendment. It deals with the practical point that if the developer is starting a development, and there is the possibility of ambiguity as to the area covered by a project of material development, and, therefore, ambiguity about what the specified operation has triggered off, if that developer has given notice under Schedule 8(36)(1), he needs some certainty as to the amount of land on which he is to be assessed. Surely it is a fairly simple matter to ask for this to be certified, so that the developer may go ahead with some certainty with the project he is undertaking.<br><br>
If the developer is faced with an assessment for over a very wide area, his tax instalments will be by that much increased, and he may well feel that it is not worth going on with the project under those circumstances.<br><br>
In many cases, from the developer's point of view, the project will be marginal when he is faced with substantial development land tax, and he must decide in the early stages how to arrange his cash flow to meet the instalments over the years that the Bill allows him. So it seems only right that at that stage he should have some right to oblige the Inland Revenue to say what it thinks about the effect of his notice, and whether he will object to it.<br><br>
The Minister said that he does not think there will be any difficulty over this, but he began his speech by saying that there were complex provisions in previous legislation about betterment levy, which increased the complexity rather than the simplicity of the legislation. He went on to say that he did not think there would be any difficulty over the lack of certification, but that if there was difficulty, he would think about it in later legislation. That is how I understood it. He said that it cannot be done in this Bill, because we shall not be able to see how it is working until it gets on the Statute Book. Horror of horrors, if we are to have another Development Land Tax Bill and all have to sit through another 40 Sessions, I hate to think about it.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0678">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 203</span>
Most of us sat through the Proceedings on the Community Land Bill. We tried to digest that, and are now trying to digest the Development Land Tax Bill. As you know, Mr. Fitch, it is not easy when we are faced with such complicated legislation, so Heaven forbid that we should have to consider another piece of legislation like this.<br><br>
I press the Minister on this point. I think that he will find that it will cause less friction between the developer and the Board and avoid argument and even litigation if there is provision for a certificate at this early stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not quite understand the complexities of the amendment and, therefore, I am not in a position to make a harsh judgment upon it. But I am enamoured of what the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said about the need in a Bill of this kind to reduce friction between the developers and the Board wherever possible.<br><br>
In dealing with the previous amendment, I was pleased to see that my hon. Friend the Minister of State stressed the need for flexibility in a Bill of this type. The greater the flexibility, the less will be the tendency for friction to arise and consequently fewer legal involvements are likely to arise. I wait to be convinced by my hon. Friend, but there seems to be some argument for having this degree of flexibility. From what the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) said, I understood that friction could arise, and there is, therefore, a case for flexibility to avoid unnecessary frictioh between the developer and the Board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I regret that I disagree with what the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Roberts) said about flexibility. The Opposition want to give the developer a discretion based upon certain and known law. There cannot be both flexibility and certainty.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was arguing for certainty. I had no strong views about the amendment, but having listened to the arguments, it seems to me that those of us who support it have had the better of the argument and that the Minister has had the worst of it. I suspect that the process of certification requires the provision by the Board of many staff and much time. I recollect that one of the ways in which the Tory Party so successfully brought the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 204</span>
betterment levy into public disrepute was to point out the enormous amount of staff and overheads that were necessary to collect a tiny levy.<br><br>
I suspect that one of the reasons why the Minister is opposed to the amendment is that he appreciates that, to have a system of certification, a fair number of spare staff must be available. The process of certification must be done quickly. If the taxpayer says that the level of tax and the time at which it is payable are crucial to his decision on whether or not to enter into the development and he therefore needs certification of his tax liability, it is no good replying "We may be able to work it out in three or four years' time."<br><br>
Usually the Board and the taxpayer conspire together because, even if the Board charges the taxpayer the rate of interest which the Treasury dictates, based upon the con trick of the going rate of inflation, they know that the Treasury is trying to work upon the country as a whole, and the taxpayer is always pleased to defer his tax liability. He then has the use of his money during a faster rate of inflation than that which the Treasury admits.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwyilym Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman knows that I have a great respect for his views. Without deviating too much, perhaps he could indicate how confidence tricks are being introduced by the Treasury.</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The confidence trick that all Treasuries perpetrate all the time is that the rate of inflation is lower than it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because no Chancellor of the Exchequer would charge interest at, say, 25 per cent., at a time when there was a rate of inflation of 25 per cent. and when, in fact, rates of interest ought to be, arguably, 30 per cent.—that is, 5 per cent. for the use of the money and 25 per cent. to take into account the rate of inflation. Say it is, in this particular instance, that the taxpayer, who is usually charged interest at a rate of, I think, 8 per cent.—it was 5 per cent.—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is 9 per cent.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0679">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 205</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is usually around half the going rate of inflation and it is, therefore, very much to the taxpayer's interest to defer his payment of tax. But it is a totally different system where there is certification, when the staff to give the decision quickly must be immediately available. That means more cost in collecting taxation and more embarrassing questions to the Minister in Parliament, and it makes the whole tax look a nonsense. I expect it is why the Minister is not keen on certification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a wide-ranging debate on this small but important amendment. The poor Inland Revenue just cannot win. If we had introduced provisions in the Bill for developers to give notices and provisions for appeal at every stage, we would have been told by the Opposition that we were making life very complicated and that we were building up a vast bureaucratic machine and why could not the whole matter be dealt with much more simply.<br><br>
We have tried to do it more simply, by putting the onus on the developer to describe the nature and scope of his development of the land and to make sure that he does not describe a piece of land that is much wider and greater than he can afford to develop in terms of development and tax. Having done that, and put the onus on developers to do their own work, they come back and say that the Inland Revenue should do that for them and that there should be counter-notices. They say "We need the certainty that the bureaucratic system can give us".<br><br>
It seems that we cannot win. We either have bureaucracy, and then are told "We do not want this bureaucracy", or we have less bureaucracy and are told "We need the prop of the bureaucracy and a developer cannot develop without that prop." It is rather unfair, but I take the point made by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
There may be cases where some certainty may be required. My difficulty, and the Revenue's difficulty, is that, once we start agreeing to issue notices of this kind, there will be other situations where notices will be required and we shall end up with something even more bureaucratic than would result even with the original proposals.<br><br>
I am reluctant to accept the amendment on that basis. We have had no representa-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 206</span>
tions from any of the bodies regarding the point. It is a small point and it may be that nobody has picked it up. I am not saying that our drafting is right because we have not had representations. I do not know how developers generally would react to the proposals in the Bill, as drafted, and how they would react to them if altered as suggested in the amendment.<br><br>
I am prepared to look at the point again, but I do not hold out any great hope that we shall accept the amendment or the idea behind it. I am sure the Inland Revenue is prepared, if possible, to try to consult and see whether developes would prefer to have this kind of provision. My own inclination is to say that the provision would not be an improvement. I cannot accept the amendment, either the principle of it or the way it is drafted, but I undertake that we shall look at the matter again to see if there are any representations that we might wish to be made.<br><br>
I am not putting the Committee off. At the moment I do not see how we could go along to meet what the hon. Gentleman wishes. If there were strong representations, we would consider the matter further.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee clearly will accept the assurance given by the hon. Gentleman, and do so in the spirit in which he gave it, that he is doubtful about it and not really in favour of it but that he will look at the matter again. That is quite a normal statement for a Minister to make, and we are happy to accept it. Plainly it must have been the splendid and pleasant support given to me by the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Roberts) which made all the difference between the original tone of the Minister's reply and his secondary answer. My hon. Friend calls it technical but wide-ranging.<br><br>
To assist the Minister in his consideration, may I suggest that as a lawyer he might ask himself what is the basic principle of equity in the matter. Would it not be more equitable that the developer should be allowed to obtain this information from the Inland Revenue in an effective written form? The word "notice" does not have to be graven upon one's heart. The hon. Gentleman talked about an exchange of correspondence. That would be all right, so long as there is some way in which the developer, in the practical circumstances I described which can, and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0680">Image</span>

indeed do, happen all the time, particularly when later phases of estates are involved, is able to have a written definition—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing to prevent the developer having discussions with the Board of Inland Revenue before he formally fills up his paragraph 36(1) notice. He can discuss the matter with the Board and then send in the form, which would clearly satisfy him because he had had discussions with the Board before sending it in. There is nothing to prevent his doing that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that taxpayers can, and continually do, have discussions with their local tax inspectors about their individual affairs, and so on, but might I finish the comment I was making? In some cases, a more formal notice or letter is required than individual discussions. Sometimes it is necessary to have these matters placed firmly on the record.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend rightly referred to discussions with local tax inspectors. He was not visualising that development would be exclusively confined to the region of Middlesbrough, was he?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, my remark referred to any discussions, whether in palatial surroundings or otherwise.<br><br>
We have had a good debate on the amendment. The Minister has promised to look at it again, and on that basis I shall later be happy to seek to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a serious issue. Unless the Board is under a statutory duty to certify, and preferably to certify within a specified period, the Board is so overworked today that the delays may be so great that by the time the decision comes out, the possibility of entering into development may have gone. We therefore want some obligation put upon the Board. If action is left to the so-called reasonableness of an individual official, no matter how reasonable he may be he may not be able to get round to doing the job.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 208</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 19, in page 72, line 32, leave out 'no'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Amendment No. 20, in page 72, line 33, leave out 'unless' and insert 'if'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The words of the amendment are unintelligible unless we deal with Amendment No. 20 at the same time.<br><br>
The phrase to which the amendments refer would then read:
<br><blockquote><p>"material development shall be taken to be comprised in the project if it was on that day authorised by planning permission then in force"</p></blockquote>
Two Speakers back I was severely teased late at night by Mr. Speaker for arguing that a comma was in the wrong place. Mr. Speaker dined out on that joke for several weeks. I had the last laugh, because the Department had to bring in an amending Order to put the comma in the right place.<br><br>
This amendment looks as if it might be one of those petty complaints about grammar or punctuation. But it is important in the change of the burden of proof, and in making the paragraph clear. In Schedule 1(5) we are dealing with an important matter, namely, the project of material development which is begun but not completed before the appointed day, and the effect that that will have on the date for commencement of the project of material development, and therefore on the liability to tax.<br><br>
As the paragraph is drafted, if the project of material development which is begun but not completed before the appointed day
<br><blockquote><p>"no material development shall be taken to be comprised in the project"—</p></blockquote>
which is a rather fierce thing to say, but the paragraph goes on to make the exception—
<br><blockquote><p>"unless it was on that day authorised by planning permission then in force".</p></blockquote>
If it was authorised by planning permission—</span></p>

away. Nevertheless, I am sure that they were important matters with which hon. Members had to deal in the corridor, and their exit did not actually indicate that my remarks were so unimportant that they did not want to listen.<br><br>
I was saying that there is no positive statement in the paragraph that, if the material development which was started before the appointed day had planning permission, it would then be included. I am merely putting it in the positive rather than the negative form. In the negative form I suggest that there may be a question whether something which was started before the appointed day, and had planning permission then in force, was not necessarily within the project of material development.<br><br>
I submit that wording in the positive form rather than in the negative form would be far more satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman apologised at the beginning for raising the issue of commas in legislation. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman need not apologise, because I seem to remember that poor Roger Casement went to the gallows because a comma was either put in or was not put in, in some piece of legislation made a long time ago.<br><br>
The question raised by the right hon. Gentleman is to some extent, as he said, a drafting one. He suggested that the words should be drafted in a positive sense to show a positive and not a negative situation. The reason for the wording is to give the developer greater flexibility. We are concerned with a developer who has started a project of material development before the appointed day, and under the legislation he can take in, as it were, development authorised by planning permission before that date. He can take that kind of development into the pre-appointed day part of the project, or, and he may have his own reasons for doing it, he can use that authorised development for a post-appointed day part of the project.<br><br>
For some reasons, such as the special addition provisions in base A of the legislation, he may wish to come within the DLT tax regime in respect of a project or parts of projects authorised before the appointed day. As the sub-paragraph is drafted, the developer may incorporate authorised developments into parts of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 210</span>
projects started before the appointed day, or hold them over until he has carried out a further part of the project after the appointed day. He would, of course, pay development land tax if he were to do that, but he may prefer that regime to the previous situation. If he works out his calculations, he may discover that he would be better off. I am not saying that he would in most cases, but as it is drafted I am advised that it gives him that choice.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
As the amendment is drafted, although it is well intended, it would in fact indicate that all development authorised by the planning permission before the appointed day would have to be incorporated into that part of the project which is carried out before the appointed day. So he could not use pre-appointed day authorised planning permission in relation to the part he carries out after the appointed day.<br><br>
I make no criticism of the amendment, because this is extremely complicated, but I am advised that it would reduce the developer's flexibility, should he so desire. I give the right hon. Gentleman this assurance. This drafting does not intend or indicate that he would be prevented from using any authorised development permission, either before or after the appointed day, so we think it gives greater flexibility. If we were to accept the amendment, it would restrict the developer to incorporating all authorised development into a pre-appointed day situation. We think that perhaps that would be too inflexible, and that is why the sub-paragraph is drafted in the negative way. I accept entirely that two negatives are not normally the best way of drafting these things, because they make drafting more cumbersome. But that is why it was done in this way and, having given that assurance, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will accept my explanation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister for his careful explanation of the deliberate drafting of the sub-paragraph.<br><br>
We are faced with this point. In giving the developer greater flexibility, one is also giving the Board greater flexibility to object to what the developer has said in his notice, because the Board will still be able to object to what the developer wants.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0682">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 211</span>
I have been trying to think on what occasion the developer would want not to escape—to use the negatives in this subparagraph—from tax. What we are talking about here is that, if the developer starts a project before the appointed day, he is relieved of tax on development value, or so I should have thought. But at some point the Minister says that the developer will choose not to bang his head quite so hard against the wall. He may have some reason for wanting to pay tax. That seems to me to be quite astonishing.<br><br>
It may be that he will want to change his Base A by manipulating the date of start of projects. I cannot quite see why, but we will come to deal with Base A, Base B and Base C later, and become a little more familiar with the jargon. But because of what the Minister has, I am not prepared to press this any further. I only hope it will work in favour of the developer, as the Minister thinks it will. Therefore, I shall be happy later to seek leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to withdraw the amendment, and of course I make no objection. But may I deal with two points that he raised. I mentioned that the drafting gave greater flexibility, and he said that it gave the Revenue greater flexibility as well. In this case, in fact, it does not, because the developer can determine, in relation to a development that has been authorised before planning permission, whether to have it on a pre-appointed or post-appointed day. The Revenue may challenge the nature and scope of a development—that is a general matter. But in this case flexibility and freedom of choice are given to the developer.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman also said that he could not envisage a situation where the developer would want to pay this tax if he could possibly not do so in relation to a pre-appointed day. A developer may be subject to income tax at higher rates than under this legislation. His costs of acquisition may be higher, by incorporating the basis of this legislation, than for income tax purposes. I am not saying that it could happen very often, but it could happen. By drafting it in this way we allow for flexibility.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: You have been very
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 212</span>
kind, Mr. Fitch, in allowing almost a double withdrawal at times. I am grateful to the Minister for putting those points on the record. I am sure it is of great value for those who read our proceedings. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. I wonder if you could arrange for a little illumination upon our proceedings; they seem to be rather gloomy at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 43, in page 72, line 42, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'or might reasonably (on the appointed day) have been expected to have been approved in that manner not being development for which, on the date of disposal, approval had been refused in that manner'.</p></blockquote>
I find the wording of some of the amendments a little complicated. The reason is to be found, I think, in the drafting. It is astonishing that practically every time we come to an amendment we are faced not with a simple change to a simple clause or even a complicated clause, but something like
<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 4(1) above, but subject to paragraph 6 below …"</p></blockquote>
so we have to refer above and below within that subsection.<br><br>
Then one finds that we are also concerned in this paragraph, by cross-reference, with paragraph 36 of Part II of Schedule 8, which, in turn, stretches over three pages. It also seems that Clause 7 (2)(<i>b</i>)(<i>i</i>) is not entirely irrelevant to our discussion. If occasionally the Opposition seem a little unclear I hope the Minister will understand the reason. Perhaps those who were responsible for this piece of legislation have greater fluency in reading six pages simultaneously. Cyclops had only one eye but it never closed. But there was someone in mythology who had a thousand, I believe. We could do with him on this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot help my hon. Friend about the person in mythology, but perhaps he is thinking of the hydra-headed monster which had a great many heads, rather like the tentacles of this Bill.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 213</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. If I may remind my hon. Friend, every time one cut one off two grew in its place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think Medusa was similar, with snakes coming out of her hair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We may be drifting a little, Mr. Fitch.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The comments we have heard are most interesting, but I think we should get back to the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must follow this up when the Government introduce a Bill on mythology. The serious issue we are faced with here is for developments which are in progress on the appointed day. Whether or not there is sufficient flexibility as to what constitutes the project in progress, I fear the Treasury may believe that planning approvals are either granted or not granted and that whether something has planning approval is always a matter of great clarity. I fear that the reverse is almost always the case.<br><br>
If we refer to Section 42 of Part III of that great piece of legislation, the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, for which we are all greateful to my right hon. Friend,—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We must scotch that statement here and now. We had a great deal of trouble on the Community Land Bill and my right hon. Friend was not responsible for the 1971 Act, which is the consolidation of Acts dating back to 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, but he was responsible for consolidating it. In an area so complicated it is helpful to have one weighty volume to which to refer.
<br><blockquote><p>"'Outline planning permission' means planning permission granted, in accordance with the provisions of a development order, with the reservation for subsequent approval by the local planning authority or the Secretary of State of matters (referred to in this section as 'reserved matters') not particularised in the application."</p></blockquote>
In my experience practically any planning approval would technically fall within the definition of an outline planning approval. Very seldom does one receive a planning approval which states "Yes" with nothing else specified other than that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 214</span>
development which, if not specified, is assumed to be specified, must start within three years. It is not necessary to put it in. The planning authority can save ink and typing time if it merely says "Yes, approved". But how often has anyone seen a planning approval which said merely "Yes, approved"? Nearly always there are reservations for further discussion, even if it is only the colour of the bricks or the paint to be used on the windows, or something which is not relevant to planning approval. That is another matter.<br><br>
What we are here concerned with is whether as worded this provision allows a project which was in practice approved, but where a number of items were reserved for further consideration, either because the planning permission was outline or conditional, or because the answer to one part of the project is "Yes" and to another part "Yes, but we would rather not give approval at this moment because there is one item we should like to discuss further." A total project is proceeding, but apparent approval has been given for only part of it.<br><br>
The amendment makes clearer that we are not trying to penalise developers who had projects in progress on the appointed day by involving them in all the procedures of this legislation merely because one element still remained for further discussion, or because there was outline or a conditional approval. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment but, if not, that he will reassure the Committee that the Bill as drafted, perhaps in some other part that I have not yet discovered, covers this aspect, so that projects that are broadly approved on the appointed day can proceed without becoming liable to development land tax.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an opportunity for the Committee to be much clearer on some of the complications raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury). This raises the whole question of outline planning permission, conditions, reserve matters and so on.<br><br>
It is not clear how the clause will work. It is, perhaps, more confusing than many in the Bill. We have to struggle through the technicalities and phraseology of the Bill as if they were mythology. My con-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0684">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 215</span>
tribution is much more down to earth than are the mythological references made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove. I merely think that the Bill presents us with nonsense similiar to that contained in the poem recited by Alice:
<br><blockquote><p>"Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe,
All mimsy were the borogroves,
And the mome raths outgrabe."</p></blockquote>
We have to struggle through the sort of technicalities set out in the Schedule. We feel that we are not only in Wonderland but right through the Looking Glass.<br><br>
We are left in considerable doubt as to the practical application of this sub-paragraph in Schedule 1. We are told in paragraph 5(2) (<i>b</i>), to which the amendment is an addition, that in determining for the purpose of sub-paragraph (<i>l</i>) namely, whether something which had been started and had planning permission is or is not material development and whether it was authorised by planning permission in force on the appointed day, only such development of the land as on that day was authorised by that permission—I presume that means planning permission was given before the appointed day—without any requirement as to subsequent approval, shall be taken to be authorised. I am not sure whether that means that it is a conditional planning permission, an outline planning permission, or a planning permission with reserve matters. Sub-paragraph (2)(<i>b</i>) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"was not so authorised but had been approved in the manner applicable to that planning permission."</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend has tried to bring more certainty to sub-paragraph (2)(<i>b</i>) by adding to it
<br><blockquote><p>"or might reasonably (on the appointed day) have been expected to have been approved in that manner not being development for which, on the date of disposal, approval had been refused in that manner."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Gentlemen will know that planning permission is given in several forms. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove has said that there is hardly a planning permission that permits a person to develop in accordance with his application. Invariably, permission is first given as an outline planning permission with matters reserved or with certain conditions attached.<br><br>
When the Bill becomes law, a person may be landed with a planning permission given before the appointed day but granted for the development of, for example, a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 216</span>
housing estate, but having matters reserved such as density, layout and architecture of the houses. My hon. Friend quoted as examples the colour the front door is to be painted and the shape of the gables. Is that to be one of the planning permissions which will authorise the work which has been started and bring that work within the project of material development? Or, when the density is decided or the roads planned, will there then be a project of material development?<br><br>
I shall deal with the two different kinds of outline planning permission. There is the kind which imposes definite conditions. These could relate to use, such as not allowing the use for a specific purpose until the expiration of so many years. On density, there could be a condition that the estate shall be phased in a certain order, namely, so many dwelling houses per year would be allowed. Paragraph 5(2)(<i>b</i>) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"so authorised but had been approved in the manner applicable to that planning permission,"</p></blockquote>
When they are approved, or when the conditions are removed or met, will that be the specified operation of the project of material development?<br><br>
That is the conditional kind of outline planning permission. The other kind is where the local planning authority reserves certain matters. Again, I hope to divide this into two classes. One is where it is clear that certain matters are reserved because they have not been put in detail to the planning authority. The planning authority may give the developer permission to develop the estate on condition that he consults the authority again on the elevation of the buildings. That is a reserved matter and would be one which would come under Amendment No. 43 but possibly not under the Bill as now drafted.<br><br>
Frequently the applicant puts in a plan showing the elevation of the houses he proposes to build, but nevertheless the authority reserves that matter. I recall occasions where the courts have decided that it is no longer classified as outline planning permission if the local authority reserves matters all of which appear in the application.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not one of the complications in this aspect of reserving matters that sometimes local authorities will say, for example, that they wish to see a sample of the bricks? A sample of bricks is not easily enclosed with plans and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0685">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 217</span>
elevations submitted for planning approval. This is a reason why practically every planning application carries some reserved matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) for giving the Committee such a practical example. It is an example which frequently occurs.<br><br>
As the paragraph is now drafted, we are left in considerable doubt as to the kind of planning permission on which it bites. The amendment would bring into the original planning application and planning permission anything which is in accordance with the application or the permission, even though it is a matter which has been reserved. If at a later date the permission is refused for those matters, that is different. Clearly one cannot treat a reserved matter in a permission which is later refused as part of the planning permission given before the appointed date. The amendment provides for that.<br><br>
But the Government must give more thought to what they intend to include in paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 1. Although it is only a transitional matter, it is important. It refers only to planning permission granted before the appointed day on work being carried out at that time. Consequently the paragraph will gradually work itself out of existence.<br><br>
But for those who are now affected by the paragraph, it is important to know exactly to what planning permission it refers. Unfortunately, under our law, planning permissions are so at variance at these times that it is difficult to apply this paragraph in practice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to give an exemption for projects for which outline planning permission has been granted before the appointed day. As the right hon. Gentleman said, we are concerned with a transitional period for planning permissions granted up to the appointed day. Once the appointed day has passed, the DLT regime comes in to all situations of that kind.<br><br>
As the Bill is drafted, in paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 only such development as was fully authorised by planning permission on the appointed day and on which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 218</span>
a start has been made by then is taken out of DLT. What hon Gentlemen have said is correct in this respect, namely, that we look towards fully authorised planning permission. Development which was not fully authorised until after the appointed day will constitute a separate project which will come under the DLT regime.<br><br>
I will give an example of the problem that arises, and we accept that there is a problem. If a developer had a scheme to erect 50 houses and roads on the site and, before the appointed day, had full permission to construct the roads, but permission to construct the houses was still subject to reservation about siting, if he starts work on the roads before the appointed day, there will be no DLT on their construction. If, however, the reservation about the siting of the houses is not removed until after the appointed day, their erection will be a separate project of material development and the developer will be liable to DLT.<br><br>
So we are concerned with the difficulty of reservations, and at present the Bill is drawn very strictly. If there is fully authorised development permission—I do not know whether that is the correct phrase—everything is all right. But if there is a reservation there is not a fully authorised development, and DLT will apply when the project is started after the first appointed day.<br><br>
I accept what has been said, but the difficulty is to draft legislation so that we can let out the minor reservations, which are not very important without going as far as the amendment, because that would exempt all outline planning permission. Under the amendment, a person might receive outline planning for a very nebulous project, extending over a long period of time, and, merely because he had received very outline planning permission before the appointed day, he would have complete exemption from DLT, although he might not start the project for a long time after the appointed day, or might spread it over a considerable period. We do not want to let in that type of case, because there would be room for considerable abuse, and I do not think it would be right.<br><br>
On the other hand, we recognise that there may be genuine reservations on all kinds of details, because planning is a complicated matter. We should like to let
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0686">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 219</span>
in that kind of situation and exempt it from DLT.<br><br>
We have had representations from the Housebuilders Federation and others. They recognise our dilemma. The representations we have received do not go as far as the amendment, which seeks to exclude all outline planning permissions, however nebulous or shaky. On the other hand, we have to try to devise a rule to let in the genuine reservation where there is a real intention to carry out a development.<br><br>
We have had discussions, but as yet we have not been able to come up with a workable rule that would protect on the one hand the Revenue in relation to outline planning permission for nebulous projects and, on the other, the developer where there are genuine reservations in planning permission. We are continuing the discussions, and the Department of the Environment is well apprised of this difficulty.<br><br>
It may be that in the end—I am now thinking aloud, not making any commitments—the real anwser is to look at planning law, as the right hon. Gentleman suggested. I am not sufficiently well versed in planning law to say, but that might be the right way to deal with it. Whether that can be done within the confines of this Bill I know not, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we accept that there is a problem here. We have no intention of penalising the case where there is a genuine reservation, but we do not want to let in cases where there is an outline planning permission but where, there could be scope for abuse because the appointed day had not arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To take up the last point about a change in planning law, as far as I know—and I checked with my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), whose knowledge of this area of the law is enclycopaedic—there is no distinction drawn, either in case law or in statute, between an outline planning permission and a detailed planning permission—or, to put it differently, terminal planning permission. The time may have come for an amendment to planning legislation to make legislation such as this clear and certain and to give a clear definition of the various forms of planning permission, drawing more clearly what is now only a practical distinction between
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 220</span>
outline and detailed planning permission.<br><br>
I am thinking aloud after listening to the debate. But it is plain that when we talk about outline permission we are all talking about different things, and it is becoming a real problem in this very technical area of the alw.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) mentioned, as did the Minister, the problems of the various types of outline planning permission.<br><br>
The range is enormous, and one of the problems referred to by my hon. Friend is that one never actually reaches a situation where one can say "There is my outline permission. The reserve matters were one, two, three, four and five. Here is a certificate or something from a local authority saying that one to five are approved." That does not happen.<br><br>
If one obtains conditional planning permission—as I have said, virtually every planning permission is conditional on something or other—as like as not one never subsequently gets approval saying "We have seen the bricks and we like them." Even if it is a much bigger matter, one never gets subsequent approval saying that the condition or reserve matter has been satisfied. That is a major problem, and, following on what the Minister has said, I hope he will consult closely not only with his colleagues in the Department of the Environment but also the House-builders Federation, the CBI and the Retail Consortium on this important point, which affects a lot of development that is currently in progress. Because unless something is done about this, we will find that practically every development that is currently in progress is caught under the provisions of the Bill.<br><br>
I should like to put one other point to the Minister. We understand the Treasury's approach to the horror and the foulness of someone actually getting away with a tiny bit of tax that perhaps he should have paid. But surely we should strike a balance here between making things so rigid as to ensure that not one wicked developer gets away with a penny of tax that he should have paid at the expense of penalising a lot of not so wicked developers—if indeed hon. Members opposite recognise non-wicked
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0687">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 221</span>
developers—and making the not so wicked pay tax that they were not intended to pay.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend has said, this is a transitional provision, so surely on this occasion, without establishing dangerous precedents for the future, the Treasury could err on the side of generosity and, to avoid including in the whole procedures of DLT those developments which have effectively been approved, and even run the risk of letting out of the regime—that was the term the Minister used—a few developments that perhaps they would like to have included. This is only a transitional situation. They do not have to establish terrible precedents for the future. So I hope the Minister will be able to tell the Committee that he will consider the need for an amendment on that basis.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought the Minister was rather narrower in what he said than the paragraph actually says in defining outline planning permission and the reserve matters. The paragraph states, in deciding
<br><blockquote><p>"… what material development of any land was authorised by planning permission in force on the appointed day, only such development of the land as on that day"</p></blockquote>
and now I come down to (<i>b</i>)
<br><blockquote><p>"was not so authorised but had been approved in the manner applicable to that planning permission."</p></blockquote>
I am not sure whether that means that it had been approved before the appointed day—I presume so—or had been approved when we come to consider them at a later date—that they had followed on after the appointed day because they were matters applicable to the planning permission.<br><br>
What we are seeking to do is to make that part of the paragraph a little clearer by saying:
<br><blockquote><p>"or might reasonably … have been expected to have been approved in that manner"—</p></blockquote>
that is, in the manner applicable to that planning permission. We should not be doing very much more than to make the paragraph clear as it stands. I am sure that the paragraph as it stands goes further than the Minister thought. In his speech the Minister deliberately said that only matters which were fully authorised at the appointed day would be taken into account.<br><br>
If there is outline planning permission and matters are reserved for further permission by the local planning authority,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 222</span>
I assume that, if the property is valued with that outline planning permission, its current use value will include a certain amount of "hope value", the hope being that the reserve matters will indeed be granted in the end much on the lines as they have been put before the planning authority at an earlier stage.<br><br>
One of the practical matters about this paragraph is that it affects the valuation of the current use value of the property at the time of, in this case, the deemed disposal. As I understand it, the current use value would be the value of the land with the outline planning permission plus the "hope value" of that permission being realised in full in due course.<br><br>
If that is so in the case of valuation, surely we can translate that into the paragraphs dealing with the date of a project of material development. So that if, after the appointed day, matters reserved by the planning permission are indeed granted, if they are matters which one would have expected to be granted when the outline planning permission was granted, it ought to be treated as part of the project which was authorised before the appointed day.<br><br>
There seems no reason to make this split. I do not think that the Revenue would lose. On the other hand, the person chargeable with tax should be given the full advantage of the planning permission which he has obtained, not only the part of the planning permission to which he can point and say "I can go ahead with this without going back to the local planning authority at all", but also of the matters which would normally follow from that planning permission.<br><br>
Indeed, if someone were purchasing the property from him with outline planning permission, that purchaser would certainly pay for the "hope value" that those reservations would eventually be cleared off and there would be full planning permission to go ahead.<br><br>
It is a matter of reality and looking at the real position of an outline planning permission and realising that, when a developer has obtained outline planning permission with several matters reserved, he does not look on that as a rejection of planning permission for his whole development. He looks on it as permission to go ahead provided that there is agreement on the details between himself and the local planning authority. So in reality
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0688">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 223</span>
it is a planning permission to go ahead with the whole project and merely agree the details of it later.<br><br>
I appreciate what the Minister says about the difference between minor reservations and the major reservations which might eventually, if they were refused, destroy the whole planning permission. There is some argument on that, but I do not think that it is logical. If those reservations are eventually removed and if the conditions are treated as satisfied and were contemplated when the planning application was first made, they should be included in the provision as if they were granted prior to the appointed day.<br><br>
The practical position of an applicant dealing with the local planning authority is that he wants to go ahead with the development. He appreciates that the local planning authority has its reservations and wants to consider exactly what he is going to do—to decide whether the development will comply with the amenities which the authority wants for the district. So the applicant goes about it by stages, first agreeing the outline with the authority and, knowing that agreement will come eventually on the points of reservation, going ahead with the project and discussing the details later.<br><br>
If the developer had had to put before the local planning authority a fully detailed planning permission before the appointed day it would have delayed many developments.<br><br>
But had the developer not known that if he did not do that he would make himself liable to the new tax—about which he perhaps knew nothing at the time—it would be unfair to say to him that since he had not presented every detail of the development before an appointed day of which he knew nothing he would be caught for tax now. That this is a form of retrospective legislation. It certainly does not recognise the realities of the case when planning permission is applied for and also when a local authority is granting it.<br><br>
If the Minister is considering whether an amendment can be made to relieve hardship on developers, perhaps he will bear in mind the case where planning permission is refused by the local planning authority and the developer appeals. On appeal, the inspector's decision goes against the developer, but the inspector would be perfectly happy to recommend
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 224</span>
the Secretary of State to allow the appeal if some comparatively minor change were made. Perhaps on the appeal there is evidence that the access to the property would cause danger on the roads. The inspector says "I am perfectly satisfied with the factory going up here. I am satisfied with the area of the factory, with the drains, sewerage and so on, but I think that the developer ought to move his access from the road one point to another." Unfortunately, as the planning law stands, the inspector cannot recommend permission for that altered project, nor can the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State normally adds a paragraph to the end of the letter saying that he accepts the inspector's recommendations to refuse the appeal but, should the applicant see fit to submit a revised plan, the local planning authority would probably approve it.<br><br>
That is a familiar paragraph at the end of a letter from the Secretary of State after an inquiry. So another application goes in and is duly granted by the local planning authority. There is no need for any further appeal and it goes through as a matter of form.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
Because our planning law takes that form, I am sure that some of those letters from the Secretary of State are outstanding which tide over 12th September 1974. In regard to the unfortunate person who has had his application turned down by the Secretary of State, and purely on the technicality that the Secretary of State cannot alter an application and must ask him to put in another one, that application will be lost. That does not come tightly within the terms of the amendment because we are talking about applications which have not been refused permission. If the Minister is thinking of trying to meet us on the amendment, I hope that he will also bear in mind the sort of case that I have described.<br><br>
Although we are right in the depths of the schedule—in the small print, so to speak—an important practical matter is involved in the amendment, and I hope that the Minister will be able to find an answer to the problem. Perhaps he may be able to go a little further in what he wants to include in that solution than he went in

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 225</span>
his original answer to my hon Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said that this is a difficult, important and practical matter. I should like to turn first to some comments made by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), who said that practically every development in progress would be caught. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman meant that strictly or indeed what he actually meant by "in progress". Development is actually in progress if work is being done, and presumably work is being done in respect of what has been authorised by planning permission. That work would not be caught because the planning permission authorises that development. We are not, therefore, looking at that situation.<br><br>
We are considering a situation in which there may be a number of reservations in the granting of planning permission, and due to those reservations those particular areas cannot be said to have been authorised within the wording of the legislation. If they are not authorised, these reservations, by identification or by implication, will not reap the benefit of the pre-appointed day exemption.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I tried to be helpful, but does the Minister appreciate the extent to which work is actually in progress on projects, where there may be fairly substantial matters which have not yet been approved? It may be that there is a housing or factory development in which one wing or section was not approved because, in discussion between the developer and the planning authority, it emerged that there was a reservation on some point on which further discussion would take place, and the developer would come back with a revised plan. In the meanwhile, the authority might be happy for the first part to go on and the process then begins. Outline permission might have been given to cover the whole project, but the detailed application had not been approved due to a reservation concerning one part of it. The planning authority might say, however, that the developer could start. This is by no means an uncommon situation. A substantial amount of work could be carried out before a reserved matter was approved, or before detailed planning
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 226</span>
approval covering the whole project was granted because discussions were still taking place.<br><br>
I apologise for my lengthy intervention, but will the Minister consider granting an exemption to any project in which construction had started on part of it?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There may be cases where development takes place in ancillary areas for which there was not specific approval, but I should not have thought that in most cases that would be so. I cannot imagine developers building wings to factories or bits to offices when they have not received approval from the local authority. I submit that we have to operate legislation on the basis that if something has been approved, there is an exemption. If it has not been approved, we cannot give exemption. The difficulty is that some reservations are minor ones, whereas some may be major reservations. There may be half-a-dozen minor reservations, or there may be 500 major reservations.<br><br>
We should like to be able to include the minor and genuine reservations, but we cannot go as far as the proposal in the amendment and include all the major reservations in the case of an outline application and outline permission. I accept that the words "outline" and "full planning permission" are not terms of art. We are concerned with what has been authorised and what has not. What we are afraid of—I made this clear—is that there will be genuine reservations. But because they are there and have not been authorised, DLT will be payable after the appointed day.<br><br>
We shall try to find a middle way between one extreme case and the other, but I indicated that practical difficulties exist, partly through lack of definition. The hon. Gentleman said, too, and this is a customary retort from the Opposition and that the Treasury should err on the side of generosity. The Treasury is always keen to be generous to people who deserve generosity. The trouble in this case is that we cannot decide, and it is difficult to decide, those who are deserving of generosity. That is why it is difficult to draw the line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the question is not whether someone deserves generosity? The question is what the law says and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0690">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 227</span>
whether there is discretion. The Treasury is not under a duty to make moral judgments between one taxpayer and another.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Inland Revenue is under a duty to prevent tax avoidance and abuse. A Committee called the Public Accounts Committee meets in the House of Commons on Mondays and Wednesdays. It is concerned about these matters. Our experience has been that, whenever a taxpayer finds a loophole in legislation, he advertises it in all the papers. Insurance brokers and others take it up, it is blazoned in all the newspapers, and the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee becomes concerned about the matter—[<i>Interruption</i>].</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman should not continually interrupt from a seated position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Chairman of the Expenditure Committee is greatly concerned. It is no good hon. Gentlemen saying that we should not worry about these minor aspects of tax abuse and avoidance, that we should err on the side of generosity. It is the duty of the Inland Revenue to collect the tax and to ensure that there are no abuses. We accept that there are cases falling on either side of the line. We are trying to devise a practical way of ensuring that genuine cases of reservation are not penalised without letting in specious outline permissions where development might not be intended for a long time.<br><br>
There is a problem. We have had discussions with the Housebuilders Federation. The Department of the Environment is looking at the problem. We hope that we can bring something forward that will be a middle course between the one extreme and the other. I hope that the Committee will be happy with that assurance. We shall do our best to solve this difficult problem within the confines of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what the Minister said, and in the hope—a hope that I trust will not be disappointed—that the hon. Gentleman will reach a conclusion on his discussions reasonably soon and will produce an appropriate amendment soon, I shall not be pressing the amendment. If the Govertment amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 228</span>
ment to meet the point which they have recognised to be valid is not tabled until the last possible moment before Report, it will be difficult and, indeed, almost impossible for the Opposition to consult those who have made representations to us on whether the proposal is adequate. I hope that the Minister will make sure that he discusses the subject in his consultations, not only with the Housebuilders Federation, but with the CBI and, I suggest, the Retail Consortium, all of whose members are affected. On that understanding I shall not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 45, in page 74, line 12, after 'above', insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'or (as the case may be) as material development begun before the appointed day'.</p></blockquote>
This is an amendment to paragraph 6(6). We are dealing with a notice from the Board of Inland Revenue given under a previous sub-paragraph, and with what happens as a result of that notice, which says that
<br><blockquote><p>"the material development specified in that notice—(<i>a</i>) shall be treated for the purpose of this Act as additional development falling within sub-paragraph (4) above".</p></blockquote>
This notice is given by the Board under sub-paragraph (5), and is therefore a notice to say whether an additional matter or a variation of the original project is a new project, and whether it falls within sub-paragraph (4).<br><br>
If the Board finds that this is a variation of a project which was started before the appointed day, surely it should say so in the notice given under sub-paragraph (6). That paragraph and that notice should make it clear that the work is not to be treated other than as an exempted development.<br><br>
The provision, as drafted, goes only half way in saying what the Board should say in that notice. I suggest that if it is found that the variation should be exempt, that should be stated in the notice.<br><br>
All that the Board is required to state is that it shall be additional development and not that it shall not be additional development, that it is a variation and therefore included in the original project.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0691">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 229</span>
I tried to be brief. I hope that I have made myself clear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to The Treasury [Mr. Robert Sheldon]</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the brevity of the right hon. Gentleman's comments. I think the Committee understands what he wants. We are here discussing the question of a development which is begun within three years of an earlier project.<br><br>
In the case where the Inland Revenue by notice has directed that this later development is part of the earlier development, the commencement date would be that of the earlier project, as stated in the Bill. The amendment seeks to ensure that if the earlier date is before the appointed day, no development land tax would be payable. That is in fact the intention of the legislation.<br><br>
Perhaps I should explain why I think the amendment is not necessary. Sub-paragraph (6) shows that where the later development is regarded as part of the earlier development, the later development is additional development which is treated as comprised in the original scheme. Therefore, if the original project was begun before the appointed day, that additional development will also be held to have arisen from the original development before the appointed day. I think that the right hon. Gentleman will see that his point is fully met by the provisions of sub-paragraph (6). Clearly, this is an important point. I believe it to be fully met by the legislation as drafted, although I accept that much of it is more complicated than one would wish it to be. Perhaps in the light of that undertaking the right hon. Gentleman will not press his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary is right. When he led me back through the clauses I saw that the matter was covered, but I am glad to have it on the record that it is so covered because the matter puzzled some hon. Members and also people outside the Committee. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 230</span>
ment No. 46, in schedule 1, page 74, line 14, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(7) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph 36(1) of Schedule 8 to this Act a person shall not be obliged to give notice of a variation which is within the nature and scope of the original project'.</p></blockquote>
The Financial Secretary has just referred to the complications, I suppose we all recognise that the considerable complications in this part of the Bill are the direct consequence of the Government's erroneous decision to try to make tax payable when a specified operation is started instead of when the proceeds of the development are realised. Inevitably, we are caught up in an endless series of complications and cross-references.<br><br>
We are trying to make life simpler—which is what we have tried to do in many of our amendments. By inserting this amendment, we are trying to avoid the necessity of a developer needing to notify the Inland Revenue of every single change, however minor, in the project.<br><br>
As I understand the wording as drafted, notification could be required for a change in the line of a drainage trench and the consequent connection to the main sewer, or a change in the colour of the bricks because others were not available. The most minor items could be caught.<br><br>
We refer back in this amendment to the words "nature and scope", which are helpful and reasonably wide-ranging words used in lines 1 and 2 on page 74. I hope that by including this amendment, all those minor variations and changes which are inevitable in any sizeable development and are common even in small developments, would not require notification to the Board. The triggering of the whole procedure under paragraph 36(1) of Schedule 8, which is quite elaborate, would mean a great deal of work for the Board and there is a delay mechanism operating all the time. One has to wait for the Board to reply. If we do not find some way of excluding the notification of minor changes, there is bound to be a large number of occasions when the Board is brought into action and will presumably say, as is suggested in paragraph (5), that it was not worried about the matter.<br><br>
I therefore commend the amendment to the Government as being most well-intentioned, and with the aim of saving time, trouble and administrative costs
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0692">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 231</span>
both to the Board and the developer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman refers to complications in the Bill. I think that any matter that deals with land is inevitably complicated, as is any matter dealing with tax. When a measure deals with both, the complicated result is inevitable.<br><br>
I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman made—namely, the need to avoid an excessive number of notifications for minor matters. There is the added problem to which he justifiably referred—the problem of the developer himself not knowing whether a matter is sufficiently minor or otherwise so that he can avoid notifying trivial matters of the kind specified by the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
The developer is required to give notice on the commencement of material development, and additions or variations are also to be notified under Schedule 8, paragraph 36(5). There have been discussions between the House-Builders Federation and Inland Revenue officials as to how the matter might be resolved.<br><br>
I think the hon. Gentleman is on to a very important point. I should like to undertake to carry on these discussions with my officials on these matters and perhaps come back on Report with something more suitable and acceptable both to the Inland Revenue and to hon. Gentlemen opposite.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for recognising that we have a problem that requires resolution. I hope that he will give us reasonable notice before Report so that we may satisfy ourselves that the Government amendment meets the point. In that expectation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 23, in page 74, line 31, leave out from 'project' to end of line 32.<br><br>
This is a probing amendment because we find it difficult to understand what the end of the sub-paragraph adds to the meaning of the earlier part of the sub-paragraph. Paragraph 8 deals with the supplementary provisions relating to deemed disposals and reacquisitions and sub-paragraph (1) determines that if
<br><blockquote><p>"the market value of an interest in land immedi-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 232</span>
ately before a project of material development is begun,—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(a) it shall be assumed—…</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(ii) that planning permission would not be and has not been granted for any development of that land which constitutes material development, which is not comprised in the project…"</p></blockquote>
Up to that point it seems fairly clear—at any rate, no more muddy and difficult than the rest of the Bill. But the end of the sub-paragraph takes us into a new degree of difficulty and muddiness. We should like the Government to explain the meaning of the remaining part of the sub-paragraph and how it in any way adds to or helps the meaning of the earlier part. Plainly some taxpayer must construe this.<br><br>
The Opposition can only say that they are unable to understand what the passage means. We do not have the vast support of the Government machine, but we have some limited expertise—probably more expertise than some developers who single-handed, will have to interpret this legislation. I am not saying that I should be able to understand the legislation, but at least some of my hon. Friends should be able to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that my hon. Friend moved this amendment because, in Committee, it is sometimes necessary to ask the Government to put on record what words actually mean for the benefit of those who read them. Some sections of this Bill are extremely complicated.<br><br>
The question my hon. Friend raised is, I suspect, the hardest question of all to ask the Minister. I well remember a very distinguished right hon. Friend, a former Cabinet Minister who is not now on the Front Bench who, when replying to an adjournment debate on rates, having read all through a departmental brief, was terrified that a member of the Opposition would say "What does that mean?" In those circumstances he said that the only thing to do was to read it out again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for understanding some of the dilemmas that the best of us are heir to at some stage in our existence. "What does it mean?" is a critical question that has to be answered. The Committee has the right at least to understand it, even if it cannot change anything. I shall attempt an explanation because I, too, had difficulty in following this part of the legislation.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0693">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 233</span>
Eventually I satisfied myself that I had some understanding at the end of it, so perhaps my explanation will cross the threshold that divides those who understand from those who do not.<br><br>
Paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 gives certain valuation assumptions for deemed disposals. One assumption is that planning permission was available for the existing development—an obviously reasonable assumption that one has a plot of land on which there is a house, for which planning permission was sought many years before, or even before planning permission was required. That particular development exists.<br><br>
In applying for planning permission for other parts of the same land, one would not need to apply for planning permission for that particular plot where the building exists and for which planning permission was sought before. That is what it is all about. It is to ensure that existing development is allowed to remain there, for without this provision it would be necessary to assume that all existing development had become unlawful and there would then be the problem of declaring a building to be unlawful when it had been in existence for many years. That clearly would be a nonsense and this provision makes the matter clear beyond doubt.<br><br>
It is useful to have this probing amendment because clarity should be the birthright of everybody who has to do with legislation. I am very happy if I have assisted in that matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

This is not a probing amendment and I understood my own amendment—or, rather, I think I understand my own amendment. It is a matter of considerable importance to developers. For the benefit of those who read our proceedings it would perhaps be useful to make it clear that the purpose of the amendment is to write in a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 234</span>
new paragraph 8(1)(c), beginning at line 35, page 74 which, if accepted, would mean that the existing paragraph 8(1)(<i>c</i>) would become (<i>d</i>), to deal with the assumptions for assessing the market value of an interest in land immediately before a project of material development is begun.<br><br>
The Minister will be aware that a number of charges fall upon developers in the course of obtaining and implementing planning permission; charges with a statutory basis—about which I shall say something in a moment—which are normal in development and have an important part to play in opening up the site. It is important that permission to offset against the market value these conditions and agreements between developers and local authorities and statutory undertakers should be taken into account because, without them, the land cannot usually receive planning permission and cannot receive the details.<br><br>
We list a number of charges which we believe should be taken into account. This is not an exhaustive list; I could also have mentioned Section 16 of the Water Act 1973, and I believe there is a provision under the Public Health Act 1936 under which charges can be made, although I have no experience of that. We mention first, Section 37 of the Water Act 1945, which provides that a developer, or any owner of land—it could be a householder or a farmer—can use the powers under Section 37(i) to requisition a supply of water to the site or property by dint of paying
<br><blockquote><p>"a sum amounting to one-eighth of the expense of providing and laying the necessary mains"</p></blockquote>
until the amount of rate income has made up the cost. That is a provision which is regularly used for the requisition of water. Obviously, every new development needs water and it is very important to the developer.<br><br>
Then, in chronological order, under Section 40 of the Highways Act 1959, a developer can, and usually does, enter into agreements with the local authority to deal with maintenance of the highway until such time, perhaps, as the local authority itself adopts that highway. It is usually done by the developer taking out a bond after discussion with the local authority.<br><br>
In passing, I should like to say that this is difficult at present. Those of us engaged
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0694">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 235</span>
in the practicalities of this matter know that it is currently very difficult to get bonds at an acceptable price from insurance companies. It is a matter that has been under discussion between the House-builders Federation and the Department of the Environment for some considerable time and I have asked Questions in the House about it. The bond system under Section 40 of the Highways Act 1959 is important and quite an expensive matter. Certainly these bonds should be taken into account when assessing the market value of the land.<br><br>
Then there are the Section 52 agreements under the Town and Country Planning Act 1971. These can be very general. Section 52(1) provides:
<br><blockquote><p>"A local planning authority may enter into an agreement with any person interested in land in their area for the purpose of restricting or regulating the development or use of the land, either permanently or during such period as may be prescribed by the agreement; and any such agreement may contain such incidental and consequential provisions (including provisions of a financial character) as appear to the local planning authority to be necessary or expedient for the purposes of the agreement."</p></blockquote>
The Committee will know that these agreements can be very widespread. There are some developments—I am thinking of one in particular in Sussex—where the agreements and the contribution to be paid by the developer over a long period of time can run into millions of pounds in order to open up the site, get schools on the site, free dedication of land, and so on. These are important and onerous charges which the developer has agreed to pay as part of the cost of opening up the site. I do not want to go further into the merits or demerits of Section 52, but I know that there are a number of my hon. Friends who, like myself, regard the Section 52 agreements as being a better way to proceed than the method in this Bill.<br><br>
Finally, other than local Acts—it is not mentioned in our amendment although I believe it is relevant and I hope that the Minister will take account of it—there is Section 16 of the Water Act 1973, a provision which to my knowledge has not yet been used, though I am open to correction on that. It was inserted on Report stage of the Water Bill by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), who was then in charge of the matter, to give to the developer the right to requisition a foul sewer—perhaps a storm sewer too, but particularly a foul
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 236</span>
sewer—to a new estate in exactly the same way as the right under Section 37 of the Water Act 1945 to requisition a water supply. Although the provision has not yet been used because the regional water authorities are only just getting under way, it is there to be used and will doubtless be used in the future and will undoubtedly involve developers in heavy charges. There are many more provisions, of course, under local Acts.<br><br>
I have made these points at some length, because it cannot be said too often that the charges listed in the amendment are an absolutely essential part of the developer's activity. No development, to the best of my knowledge, can go ahead without a road bond. There are provisions to go to magistrate's courts, but they are long and tedious. No developer is going to risk having to deal with all the roads after the development is completed. He wants to get them done at the beginning and must have a road bond.<br><br>
Similarly, the other conditions and financial contributions mentioned in the amendment are an increasing part of the developer's activity. It is a reasonable amendment and one which the Minister could accept in principle. I believe that Section 16 of the Water Act and Section 37 should also be mentioned and I hope that the Minister will be able to give a sympathetic reply.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope to reassure the hon. Gentleman by telling him that the amendment is not necessary. The hon. Gentleman said originally that it was a probing amendment, in the sense that people who have to carry out these obligations would like to be reassured. Any expenses and obligations incurred as a result of the various statutory obligations, and indeed any other statutory obligations which may not be listed in the amendment, will be taken into account one way or the other in the legislation. For instance, if before the commencement of a project of material development a developer has incurred expenditure as a result of these statutory obligations, that expenditure will be included in the base value when the tax is calculated on the deemed disposal. It will rank as expenditure for improvements within the definitions in Schedule 3. It will come into the base value and will be taken fully into account when the computation is made of the difference between base value
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0695">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 237</span>
and whatever the net market value might be on a deemed disposal. At that point it is taken care of.<br><br>
If at the point in time when the project is started these costs have not been incurred, but of course they are statutory obligations on the developer, again the value of the cost of those obligations will be taken into account in assessing the market value and in making the computation on the deemed disposal. At the point of deemed disposal, we have to look at the market value which will take into account burdensome obligations of this kind which will be imposed on the developer and, indeed, on the land, because anyone developing the land would incur obligations. The value of the land will be reduced by the burden of the expense of these obligations and in that way there will be a credit or a relief for the cost of carrying out the obligations. So either way, whether the developer has incurred expense before he starts the project or whether he incurs expense after the project, he is completely safeguarded and the costs are excluded from his final tax bill.<br><br>
Various other statutes and sections of statutes were mentioned which should be added to the amendment. This is one difficulty with the hon. Gentleman's amendment. The list of statutes would soon get out of date because other legislation would impose other obligations. We think that it is better to deal with the matter in this way and that any cost, statutory or otherwise, will be included in computing liability and there will be no taxation on that part which is a cost and not a profit.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be satisfied with that assurance. We have met the point fully and there is no question of developers having to pay tax when they incur costs in relation to these statutory obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for that assurance. If that is so, then there can be no harm in making a statement to that effect in the Bill itself. Paragraph 8 in Part II of Schedule 1 tells us that in determining
<br><blockquote><p>"the market value of an interest in land immediately before a project of material development is begun"</p></blockquote>
we shall take into account certain matters. One assumes from that that one shall not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 238</span>
take into account certain other matters. These points, having been specifically set out, look to be, as the Bill is drafted, exhaustive. Obviously if there has been expenditure under the statutes before the date of deemed disposal, before the calculation of the market value has to be made, it comes elsewhere in the Bill. I imagine, that there would be expenditure on improvements and that they would be relevant improvements, which I think we shall come to call RI's later in the Bill.<br><br>
I am glad that we are not further down the passage in the Education Bill, or it would be religious instruction. They would be relevant improvements in this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: RIP!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It might be RIP, as my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) interjects.<br><br>
I can see that that is included elsewhere in the Bill. But here we are assuming the market value as at the date of deemed disposal, because this part of the Schedule deals only with deemed disposals and reacquisitions. We are told that the market value must be arrived at by certain assumptions, and those are clearly set out.<br><br>
The Minister has said that we will also assume that the market value is dependent upon any covenants, restrictions and agreements under the statutes which my hon. Friend has set out in his amendment.<br><br>
Because of the importance of this question, I think that it ought to be set out in some way in the Bill. It might be that it would not be right to set it out by reference to the specific statutes that are in operation at the moment, although I see no reason why that should not be done, and if any new statute is brought in, it could be mentioned in that statute that it should be included within this provision.<br><br>
Agreements such as the Section 52 agreement will become more and more important. As my hon. Friend the Member for Melton has said, many of us think that the whole of the Community Land Act and this DLT Bill are entirely unnecessary, with Section 52 agreements being carried out between the local authorities and developments, and that the achievement of development could have been made by this kind of agreement.<br><br>
If that is so, and if such agreements are to become even more important—I hope
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0696">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 239</span>
the will not suggest an amendment to the Minister—if properly manoeuvred, they could relieve the developer of a considerable amount of tax. The local authority, of course, is not liable for DLT—and I am glad that the Minister is shutting his ears. I say that only because it does make such agreements more important than they have been. If one can arrange a Section 52 agreement so that the major part of the development value comes into the lap of the local authority, which does not pay the tax, then the developer is, quite rightly, relieved of some of the tax.<br><br>
I think that is right. We should do all we can to encourage that kind of agreement between local authorities and developers, and between water authorities and developers and, indeed, between highway authorities and developers. There should be this co-oeration, and there should also be the incentive of being able to manoeuvre one's tax a little better by such agreements.<br><br>
If such agreements have been important in the past, and if they are to be more important in future, I do not think we should leave any doubt in the Bill that any obligations accepted by the developer at the time when the market value has to be assessed should be taken account of in this paragraph. It should be specifically stated that the market value should take into account the obligations under those agreements.<br><br>
There will be such a major change in the market value of the land under deemed disposal that we cannot leave it without setting out some safeguard in the Bill. I do not see any difficulty in actually naming the statutes concerned. Since drafting this amendment, we have found, as my hon. Friend the Member for Melton said, that there were certain other statutes, such as the recent Housing Act, and certainly Section 16 of the Water Act and—I am not sure whether he mentioned specifically the last three words of the amendment—"any local Act". I think it is common knowledge that before Section 52 found its way into legislation, there were many local Acts that achieved the purpose of Section 52 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971.<br><br>
In many other local Acts, Parliament has allowed local authorities to "improve" on Section 52 of the 1971 Act. I recollect that Manchester set a precedent on this in its private Bill and went very much further than Section 52 in the kind of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 240</span>
agreements that could be brought about by the local authority and the developers.<br><br>
I ask the Minister to look again at whether this ought not to be specifically mentioned. If he says that there is a safeguard, I would ask him to spell out to the Committee where in the Bill he would point to and say "There is the safeguard. There is the obligation on the Board to assess market value only after taking into account the obligations under this kind of agreement." At the moment he is relying on the valuation point, on the opinion of valuers, and of course valuation is not—if I may say so, with apologies to valuers—an art. In valuation it is always a matter of opinion. If we are to insist on valuers taking something into account in assessing market value it ought to be said specifically in the Bill.<br><br>
I hope that the Minister will either look at this again or point to somewhere in the Bill and say "There it is. No one can wriggle out of this. Whenever the market value of property is being assessed this has to be taken into account". If that is in the Bill, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Melton will think again about pressing the amendment. If it is not, we want some specific safeguard put in.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had no intention of intervening in this short debate until I heard my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) referring to Section 52 agreements, and I think I ought to express my grave reservations about some of the suggestions that have been attached to the use of Section 52 agreements in the future.<br><br>
It seems that there is a grave danger of confusing the purposes of Section 52 agreements and payments. Naturally I support the idea that Section 52 should be used for genuine payments to be made by developers for services which they have actually received. That is a straightforward contractual payment for benefits that they either have or hope to receive.<br><br>
What I feel bound to say I am not in favour of is the use of Section 52 as some form of undercover system of taxation. If we are to have taxation of development profits in my submission, it is much better to have a certain tax which is known and can be calculated, and which is at a certain level, rather than to allow Section 52 to be used as some form of wholly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0697">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 241</span>
arbitrary taxation to be levied by local authorities. I am very sceptical about these proposals to extend Section 52, and while I agree with the technicality of this amendment I am bound to say that I do not feel that Section 52 ought to have the extended use that some people suggest.<br><br>
We on this side of the Committee have to grit our teeth. We have got to decide whether we want to have a tax on development profits. If we decide, albeit reluctantly, that we want that tax, there ought to be a tax imposed in the normal way for taxation. The important thing is to have certainty and clarity and to avoid most of all arbitrary and, possibly ultimately, corrupt methods which could be used by giving to local authorities a new system of tax gathering.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support the amendment. Account must be taken of Section 52 of the Town and Country Planning Act. I also support what my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) said about Section 52 agreements. I am sure there is nothing in Section 52 which implies that it should be regarded in any way as an under-cover tax. It is, as my hon. Friend said, intended to be a payment, not for services received, but for services required to enable that development to be carried out. The risk is that it is open to abuse. On the one hand, a prospective developer can ask "If I were to make that much larger a payment, would there be that much better a payment"? On the other hand, a local authority may say "If you make a payment of £X, perhaps we would look with favour upon a planning application", an application upon which the authority should look with favour, anyhow, in exercising its planning function.<br><br>
Another point which is relevant to the amendment is that there is a risk under Section 52 agreements that one pays twice for the same thing. After all, the occupant pays rates not only for the running of the sewage works but for the appropriate capital works involved in repairs, replacements and all other aspects. If one has to make a total payment for an extension and then continue to pay normal rates which cover the same item, the occupants of a development which has been subject to a Section 52 agreement requiring the payment of the major capital sum could find
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 242</span>
themselves paying twice—first, through the price they have to pay for development and, secondly, as ratepayers. I therefore go along with my hon. Friend in expressing some reservations about Section 52 agreements. All the same, I support the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to intrude into the debate among the Opposition as to whether we have a special tax on land or whether we have a variation of Section 52. I assume that they have not put Section 52 forward as their alternative to the present legislation because of the difficulties of that section. I share some of the doubts that have been expressed about a discretionary tax, which Section 52 might well be. We are well briefed to answer these points, but they have not arisen so far and they may not arise at all. We expected them to arise on Second Reading, but they did not come up. Perhaps we shall hear more after Committee.<br><br>
I give the right hon. Gentleman the assurance he is seeking. I am a little surprised that he was not satisfied with what I said originally. He referred to paragraph 8. If he looks at it again he will see that it imports the idea of market value and in computing this tax, market value has been determined. "Market value" is a general phrase and all the factors that have to be taken into account in assessing market value are taken into account. Section 52 is one of the normal factors taken into account by valuers when valuing land. If there is a Section 52 obligation it is taken into account. It is perfectly well known among valuers that it should be, and is, taken into account when deciding a figure for market value. It is covered in the Bill, because many factors come into account when determining market values and Section 52 is one of them.<br><br>
The right hon. Member then went on to say that there are certain assumptions in sub-paragraph (1)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). He asked whether it was to be taken that those are exhaustive assumptions and that we cannot make any other assumptions? Because we have set out three or four assumptions in sub-paragraph (1), we cannot assume that Section 52 agreements and other obligations are not to be taken into account. May I make it quite clear that that is not the case. The fact that a few assumptions have been listed in paragraph
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0698">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 243</span>
8(1)(<i>a</i>) does not mean that it is exhaustive and that it excludes other assumptions. It merely sets out certain assumptions which the draftsmen say must be taken into account. The assumptions in (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are introduced for various reasons. But the general assumptions, in arriving at market value, are all taken into account, anyway. Anything which is not excluded in (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) is included and the statutory obligations are not excluded. It is perfectly proper to take them into account when one arrives at market value.<br><br>
I should have thought that was a better way of dealing with it. If we were to lift a number of obligations from the Bill, the same question would arise again. Is this an exhaustive list? What about so-and-so and such-and-such? What about these assumptions? I should have thought in legislation that we would accept this. It is preferable not to set these things out in detail when they are well known and have been accepted for a considerable length of time. If one puts them in legislation, one can add to the confusion. That is why we do not wish to put these obligations into the Bill. They will be clearly taken into account. If there are any disputes about market value between the Board and the taxpayer they will be decided in the normal way before the Lands Tribunal. The taxpayer will have his valuer there who will no doubt put forward his arguments. In most cases I do not foresee any difficulty at all in relation to statutory obligations.<br><br>
I hope that the Committee will accept that these assumptions are not exhaustive but are merely indicative. They do not inhibit other assumptions, such as the important assumptions relating to statutory obligations. These obligations will be taken into account either in assessing market value or, if the taxpayer has incurred expense, they will be taken into account in arriving at his market value. There is no question that he will not receive credit for these assumptions. We prefer not to list them in the Bill, because there will be other statutes and other obligations arising later and we will have to change the Bill and introduce amendments to include another list. That would not be the right way to promulgate this kind of legislation. I hope with that assurance the Committee will accept what I say.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee is grateful to the Minister for the two state-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 244</span>
ments he has made, which will be studied in <i>Hansard</i> before the next stage fo the Bill. It is an important matter and it would be appropriate to reserve our position until later.<br><br>
Before I withdraw the amendment I should like to say that after the very kind remarks my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) made about me at our sitting on 30th March—this is column 142—it was too much to assume that we might avoid disagreement at a later stage. What is it the good book says? Whatever it is, I fear the Greeks, especially when they come bearing gifts. That is what we have had on this occasion.<br><br>
Reverting, however, to serious matters, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 24, in page 74, line 37, leave out 'no'.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Because Amendment No. 24 goes with Amendments Nos. 25 and 26, it is unintelligible unless we discuss the other two amendments at the same time.<br><br>
As the Committee will readily appreciate, when dealing with three amendments on a complex subject it would be quite impossible for me to give all my reasons for the amendments in 60 seconds. I therefore propose to call the attention of the Committee to the fact that there are three amendments, that one of them is to paragraph 8(1)(<i>c</i>). We then have to turn to page 75, and remove some words from the beginning of paragraph 9(1) and insert some other words.
