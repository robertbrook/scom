</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are amendments to which the Opposition attach great importance. They do not fall into the category specified by my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) last night where we would have been anything but delighted if the Government had accepted them. There is no element of doubt in our minds about the importance of these amendments.<br><br>
As the Minister will no doubt tell us, there are two distinctly different types of amendment embodied here. In your wisdom, Mr. Crawshaw, you have grouped them together, and I understand that.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1432</span>
Amendments Nos. 419 and 432 attempt to inject at the very least some kind of logic into the situation. As the Bill stands, the due date for payment of DLT is defined on page 153 of the Bill as being either
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) the reckonable date, or</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>b</i>) the expiry of the period of thirty days beginning with the date of issue of the notice of assessment".</p></blockquote>
However, the criterion used for the basis for interest on unpaid tax is not the due date but the reckonable date.<br><br>
We would not attach so much importance to the question of interest on unpaid tax were it not for the fact that the interest proposed will be extremely high at 9 per cent. Furthermore, 9 per cent. interest in many quite plausible cases might have to be paid over two or three years. The Minister did not accept our arguments last night that in many cases the appeals procedures might take at least a year, and possibly two or three years, during a period in which the matter of the tax is under dispute.<br><br>
If one assumes that in two and a half years' time the rate of tax will be 80 per cent., and the rate of interest on unpaid tax is to be computed three months from the reckonable date, if our amendments are not accepted in some form there will be many who will be paying over 100 per cent. in taxation under the terms of the Bill. That is unfair, even on the Government's terms.<br><br>
It is unfair to allow a situation where many people, because of the lengthy, complex, protracted nature of the appeals procedure—the Bill does not allow for any speedy appeal procedure—will be paying more than 100 per cent. in taxation, and that will happen if the existing position concerning the reckonable date, and the period from which interest to be charged, is maintained.<br><br>
Amendments Nos. 419 and 432 attempt as a small and, to my mind, unsatisfactory step, merely to follow the logic of the Bill. They suggest that, if the due date is to be as defined on page 153, as either the reckonable date or a date based upon the notice of assessment, the period from which interest on unpaid tax is to run should at least reflect that. That is the very least to be expected from the Bill.<br><br>
However, my own feeling is that we should—I hope to carry my hon. Friends with me—press much more firmly for Amendments Nos. 229 and 421 to be accepted. These amendments propose
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1337">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1433</span>
that the period during which interest should be payable on unpaid tax should run from the point at which the assessment has been agreed. That was the situation before the Finance (No. 2) Act 1975, and it is an eminently fair arrangement.<br><br>
If we accept the absolute minimum position where the interest runs from the notice of assessment we will have the inspectorate issuing absurdly high assessments at a very early stage, as is already proving to be the practice under the terms of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1975. The taxpayer is then faced with paying tax which both sides consider to be absurdly high, and trying to recoup something at a later stage, with all the problems of endeavouring to get interest on that over-payment. Alternatively, he is faced with the situation of having his interest on unpaid tax computed from that point.<br><br>
There is also an additional problem. We are lengthening the procedure which could face a taxpayer, but it is not only the question of appeals. There is also the slowness with which district valuers appear to proceed these days, possibly through no fault of their own and perhaps due to the burdens placed upon them by central Government.<br><br>
Therefore, at the very least, Amendments Nos. 419 and 432 should be accepted, if only to fulfil the logic of the Bill. The Bill is quite clear that the due date can be taken to be the date on which the assessment hss been raised.<br><br>
However, even that would not be entirely acceptable, and we strongly urge the Government to reconsider accepting the ideas embodied in Amendments Nos. 229 and 421 which propose that interest should be paid from the point at which the amount of tax has been agreed. Even if they do not want to go back on the principles established in the Finance (No. 2) Act, surely they must accept that this is a different type of Bill. It is a Bill, which, as the Minister admitted late last night, is so complex that not even an intelligent man in the street will understand it. That is why the Government were not prepared to concede that a taxpayer should have the right to choose to go to the general commissioners.<br><br>
If there is to be this complex valuation problem and appeals, surely the Government must accept that the taxpayer should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1434</span>
not be penalised, in that because of the Bills complexity if he exercises his rights to be able to go through the appeal procedure we are suggesting that the Bill as unamended will result, perhaps, in many cases, in his having to pay over 100 per cent. tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to try to improve the logic of the Bill. We are all in favour of logic. Oliver Wendell Holmes said that the life of the law is not logic. I believe he was referring to statute law. We have logic on our side too. That is the trouble with logic, music and other things.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) has correctly explained the position, that interest will run from the reckonable date, which is three months after the chargeable event. In the case of an ordinary sale where there is a contract and a conveyance, the chargeable event is the date of the contract. Normally, conveyance takes place within six weeks of contract. The reckonable date will be three months after contract, so in most cases there will be a considerable time after the conveyance before interest starts to run. The importance of that is that the taxpayer will have the money in his pocket from his sale of land. Therefore, he will have the money before the reckonable date arises.<br><br>
I am suprised that the hon. Gentleman thinks that 9 per cent is a high rate of interest. Many people wish they could borrow money at 9 per cent. today. Indeed, if we were to reduce the rate to less that 9 per cent. I imagine that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) would have something to say about that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we are saying is that the taxpayer is not borrowing from the Government. The amount has not been agreed. If he were borrowing from the Government in the strict sense, fair enough; then the Minister's argument that 9 per cent. is reasonable would be a good point. But we are saying that the matter may be in dispute, the taxpayer may not be borrowing from the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, the interest would be paid on the tax that is payable. The interest will not be paid on anything
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1338">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1435</span>
else. There will be an agreement, a settlement of a final assessment; a figure will be reached, and 9 per cent. interest will be charged from the reckonable date on that figure. No interest will be paid until the figure of tax liability has been agreed. The interest will be computed back at 9 per cent. from the reckonable date, if the tax has not been paid at that time.<br><br>
We are not concerned with the taxpayer having to dip into his pocket immediately the reckonable date arrives for 9 per cent. on some mythical figure, or on the purchase consideration. We are concerned with a back computation after the final assessment has been agreed of a sum of money at 9 per cent. from the reckonable date. I must make that clear.<br><br>
The purpose is to speed up the completion of these transactions. This is an attempt to get the matter settled quickly. Hon. Gentlemen yesterday were concerned about local authority sales and said that these things take time. They do take time, but 9 per cent. interest might concentrate the mind somewhat and lead to a speedy conclusion, which is in everybody's interest.<br><br>
The Government have a duty to collect the tax. If they allowed these things to go on for a long time, they would be in dereliction of their duty. We think it is fair to have an interest rate running from the reckonable date. This is a different kind of tax, where the money will be paid reasonably quickly after the chargeable event in most cases, and we think it only right that interest should run three months after the date of contract.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
In the case of local authority sales—net of tax sales—the rule is not the same. There, interest is chargeable only from the reckonable date on any excess amount of DLT that will be payable by the taxpayer over and above what was deducted by the local authority. It would not be fair to charge interest on the whole amount in respect of the net of tax arrangements, because the taxpayer has suffered tax by deduction, and to try to maintain a balance between sales to a local authority and sales between private purchasers and private vendors, interest will run from a reckonable date only on any excess over the amount of the local authority deduction in the case of local authority sales. We hope that that will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1436</span>
mitigate to some extent what might on the face of it seem to be the disadvantage of a person selling to a local authority.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman was quite right in saying that there is a precedent for this, though I do not necessarily rely on it. The precedent is Section 46 of Finance (No. 2) Act 1975, which I accept that hon. Gentlemen do not like. However, this case is stronger, because here we have a purchase consideration which has been paid. There is every incentive to get together to compute the liability and pay the tax. I think it is a reasonable and fair balance between the interests of the taxpayer, who clearly wants to get the figure right, and the interests of the Revenue, which wants to have the revenue in order to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement and meet other Government obligations. I think that on balance it gives a fair result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that hon. Members on this side must be disappointed in the Minister's reply. He said that he would put some logic into the Bill. He tempts me to quote the definition of logic by Tweedledee—
<br><blockquote><p>"if it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be: but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic."</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that, if it is so—if there is agreement between the parties—the chargeable person can avoid paying this heavy interest. But this is a new tax—a new procedure—and the statement that the interest is chargeable before the chargeable person even knows what his interest is chargeable on—and that is very bad grammar, but one is tempted to it in this Bill—makes the mind boggle.<br><br>
There can be no harm if the Government accept Amendments Nos. 419 and 432. We were generous in putting those on the Amendment Paper at all. Here the Board will itself have the right to terminate any delay by the chargeable person. The notice of assessment can be given, and at that stage the Revenue can put an end to any dilly-dallying and dilatoriness by the chargeable person. I do not think that that is generous enough to the unfortunate taxpayer, but we have put it down in a moderate way, and I should have thought that that at least could be accepted.<br><br>
The person called upon to pay interest on an amount which is not finally settled is in a difficult position. Therefore, we
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1339">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1437</span>
tabled Amendments Nos. 229 and 421, which seemed fair to the chargeable person. When one is setting up a new levy, one ought to be generous as to when it should be paid and, therefore, as to the date from which interest should be charged.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to open his warm heart again—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is too early in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that that was exactly the time at which to have a generous heart and to help the Committee through the formidable list of amendments before us on Schedule 8. If we could start off with a nice little concession early in the morning, we might get through this list in a splendid way. Indeed, I am offering a concession. I am tempting my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) not to press the amendments that we really want, Nos. 229 and 421, if the Minister will come half-way and accept Nos. 419 and 432.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that we ought to leave it quite where the Minister has left it. The problem is not those cases where there is simply a need to settle the liability quickly. There are bound to be cases where the taxpayer will find that he has a greater liability to tax than he expected, or particularly when selling to a local authority the deduction formula may not work out quite as expected. The taxpayer may find that he has been in possession of moneys which he then has to part with as tax at a later date without having had good reason to know that he would have to do so. In the meantime, he has had the use of that money.<br><br>
There is no way on earth in which a taxpayer at any of the higher rates can secure an after-tax return of 9 per cent. If he has any investment income already, the extra income produced by putting on deposit the amount that he may have to pay over in further tax may well take him into the investment income surcharge. Even if the tax is at the standard rate, that will be 50 per cent., so he would need an 18 per cent. return to achieve 9 per cent. after tax. If his tax rate is any higher than that, it becomes absolutely impossible
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1438</span>
to provide 9 per cent. without dipping into the capital itself. I think that that is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) is trying to make. Unless this interest can be relieved against other liability to tax, a 9 per cent. undeductible charge to interest will be a great extra burden.<br><br>
I think we all agree that it will be necessary to hurry things along, and it is right that both sides should have an incentive to do this, as the figures may be large and it is well to come to an agreed figure as soon as possible. But this will not always be practicable. It is not as if this were a simple tax to calculate. It is not as if the valuations involved will be simple or unanimous from one expert to another. There will be considerable areas of doubt and difficulty.<br><br>
I hope, therefore, that on further reflection the Government will see that a 9 per cent. interest charge is not reasonable in cases—and there are bound to be a number of such cases—where there is no unwillingness on the part of the taxpayer to meet his proper liability, but where by some error, alteration or retrospecitve adjustment, which I suspect will be all too common, he finds that he has to pay a rate which he could not possibly have provided by any sensible or prudent use of the money in the meantime.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I just deal with the point that a higher rate taxpayer could not get a 9 per cent. return? I do not want to pursue that argument. I really do not know. I accept much of what the hon. Gentleman says. But I am told that a higher rate taxpayer could get a 9 per cent. return on money held awaiting determination of liability by making a payment on account under paragraphs 55 and 56 of Schedule 8. He would get a 9 per cent. return in respect of that deposit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is helpful to have that pointed out, but, if the taxpayer does not know what the extra liability will be, there is no certainty. Although I agree that that is a useful means of providing for the liability in a case where he is aware that he may have further liability and where he has some idea of the extent of that liability, there will remain cases where he is not in a position to know that he will have any further liability at all, or he might reasonably think that.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1340">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1439</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What we are talking about at the higher rate of tax is about 400 per cent. That is what 9 per cent. at the highest rate of tax represents. I cannot believe that the highest rate taxpayer will get that back in any possible way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He will receive 9 per cent. tax-free on that deposit, if he pays his money on account.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I comment breifly on the very generous suggestion made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) that we might concede every other amendment today if the Government would accept this one? I think, incidentally, that we should probably want Amendments Nos. 229 and 421 if we were to do that, but I am sure we could do a barter for Amendments Nos. 419 and 432—perhaps we would probably do half.<br><br>
The point is that this is a very crucial group of amendments. It will have a very substantial effect, for the reasons which have now been added to by my</span></p>

<p>Question accordingly negatived.</p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Amendment made</i>: No. 408, in page 143, line 10, leave out from 'of' to end of line 11 and insert 'that Act'.—[<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 420, in page 143, leave out lines 48 to 50 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'23. The rate of interest to be applied to development land tax liabilities shall be 6 per cent.'.</p></blockquote>
This is the related point which we anticipated in the previous debate, where we suggest that, if the Government are unable to be more generous about the date from which the interest should run, they should at least consider a lower rate of interest. At 9 per cent. individuals on the highest rate of tax will, in effect, be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1440</span>
right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart). It will cause a very serious problem. Under the next amendment we shall discuss the rate, and it will be quite apparent in that discussion that this will hit, particularly, corporate taxpayers very hard indeed. They will probably have to pay well over 100 per cent. in taxation through, in most cases, no fault of their own, when the delay in payment arises entirely from the delays that occur in valuations and, in some cases, on appeal procedure.<br><br>
If we cannot get even the concession that we should have liked under Amendments Nos. 419 and 432, which—I say again—although they are not entirely acceptable, at least make the payment of interest run from the due date, as defined by the Government in their own Act, we shall press Amendment No. 419 to a Division with the utmost panache and vigour.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 6, Noes 9.</p>
<p>paying 400 per cent. Corporations which are not at present able to set off the interest payable against corporation tax will, therefore, be subject to a figure of about 18 per cent. as a result of having to pay 9 per cent. tax. The result will be, as I indicated in the previous debate, that individuals and corporations faced, through no fault of their own, with delays will pay swingeing rates of taxation and the interest associated with it, where there are appeal procedures, problems and delays in valuation.</p>
<p>We suggest that we should go for a rate of interest comparable, for instance, with stamp duty rate and the rate charged on CCT payable by executors. The Minister and I seem to be constantly discussing the logic of our positions. I do not entirely accept that his position—certainly on the last amendment—had any logic. But there is a certain logic in tying the rate

into other forms of interest rate with respect to other forms of taxation.</p>
<p>The 6 per cent. figure is not picked out of the blue. It would have a considerably beneficial effect upon companies. I ask the Minister to consider this at least as a temporary measure.</p>
<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) made the point that, even if the Minister does not accept the basic premise of the last debate, surely he will accept that there are transitional problems. Nobody knows how this complex piece of legislation will affect him or the tax that he will pay. Why not allow people, in the present situation, to pay a lower rate of interest until it settles down? The Minister would retain the powers to raise the interest rate at a later stage, but why not, while the Act goes through its teething problems, people impose a rate of 6 per cent. on people who do not pay the tax at the date upon which the Government insist that they should—which itself is illogical? If there were a one to two-year delay and we assume that they are paying the 80 per cent., it would mean that we are not insisting upon a payment of tax at over 100 per cent. Let us put it no higher or more emotively than that.</p>
<p>I beg the Minister to consider this minor concession, one that he or his successors can alter at will, but which will help people considerably over the transitional problems associated with the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) touched on this point on the earlier group of amendments. Now we are meeting the point again. The amendment proposes a reduction in the rate of interest from 9 per cent. to 6 per cent. The figure of 9 per cent. is not entirely arbitrary, as the hon. Gentleman recognises. As from 1st July 1974 it has been the percentage interest rate charged for taxes.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned stamp duty, estate duty and capital transfer tax on executors. I am not questioning that. I am sure he is right, but generally it is now 9 per cent. It was 6 per cent. until 1st July 1974. It had been 6 per cent. for four years since 18th April 1969, but it was felt that, because of the rise in interest rates during the past few years, it was right to put it up to 9 per cent. Nine per cent. is not a high rate of interest
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1442</span>
in the present climate. We should like to see interest rates fall. Industrial companies borrowing from banks have to pay 11 per cent., 12 per cent., 13 per cent. or 14 per cent. A person buying a house through a building society has to pay 11½ per cent. or 12 per cent. in some cases. Nine per cent. is not excessive.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asks where one could get an after-tax return of 9 per cent. One could look at it the other way and say that the man has the use of the money. If he had wanted to borrow an equivalent amount of money, he would have had to pay from 11 per cent. to 14 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If a person wanted to borrow that money, he could set the interest payable on money borrowed for other purposes against corporation tax. There is a distinction to which I shall return later, if I may.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: He might, but if he were an individual he would not always be allowed to set that money off. But if a company borrows at 14 per cent., as many companies do, with corporation tax rate at about 50 per cent. we are still down to about 9 per cent. I do not think that 9 per cent. is out of line with general interest rates. It is reasonably fair. It is pitched below market rates deliberately because there are other factors involved.<br><br>
To pitch the rate at half or more than half of the going rate for industrial borrowers—perhaps not prime borrowers from banks, but industrial companies with good records—would be going a little far. Nine per cent. is reasonable. Nobody can borrow, as far as I am aware, at 9 per cent. today from building societies, banks or finance houses in general. On balance, 9 per cent. is sensible. It is pitched low enough not to be punitive. It is pitched high enough to encourage the swift settlement of liabilities.<br><br>
As I said earlier a payment on account will produce a rate of interest of 9 per cent. tax-free. In some cases it may be difficult for the taxpayer to know how much money to pay on account, but in most cases it will not be all that difficult. He will have a good idea what his tax liability will be, because we are not talking about small sums. We are talking about people who sell land, and receive the benefit of development value, and often large sums of money are received. These people will
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1342">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1443</span>
know how much money to put on account. Their accountants will not be backward in coming to a fairly reasonable provisional assessment. I have no doubt that the money will be put on deposit by prudent taxpayers to earn 9 per cent. and so wipe out the interest charge of 9 per cent.<br><br>
I believe that to be fair. Nobody likes paying taxes, or paying interest on taxes. But we must balance the interests of the Government and the Revenue with those of the taxpayer. We have managed to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to ask the Minister a brief question for the purposes of clarification. A taxpayer might have his land acquired by an exempt authority—that is, it is bought under the procedure set up in Amendment No. 406, which was carried by the Government yesterday. A formula deduction will be made by the local authority and subsequently the Revenue and the taxpayer argue it out between them. However, the Revenue might finally decide that an under-deduction had been made and that the taxpayer owed more tax than the local authority had deducted. From which point does the three-month period begin to bite? When is the reckonable date in such circumstances?<br><br>
Under Clause 46(1) the reckonable date appears to be the actual time that the local authority purchased the land. If so, it is unreasonable that interest should be charged back to that time when the taxpayer had no idea of the correct deduction because it had initially been made in accordance with the formula by the local authority and it could subsequently take many months of negotiation with the Revenue to get it right. Will the Minister clarify the position?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add a question arising from that? Will there be reconciliation between the interest payable under this provision and the rate of interest which applies on compulsory purchase to outstanding compensation and, I presume, to the excess deducted, or the amount not deducted, on a sale to a public body?<br><br>
My recollection is that the 9 per cent. payable on arrears of income tax is not alterable by Statutory Instrument in the same way, and certainly not as regularly, as the interest on compensation owing. We have these little instruments which come through about once every six months
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1444</span>
altering that rate of interest. These two are tied together, but we are dealing with capital money related to property. It will be related to transactions particularly where compensation is payable. I am not sure how one is to keep those two in line.<br><br>
It will be unfair if they are not kept in line and the chargeable person is to be charged a different rate of interest from that which he may receive if the local authority has taken possession of his property without paying the compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister responds, may I also ask a question? He made the point that this rate of interest was pitched, in his words, at half the going rate. Can we, therefore, assume that there is a formula based on a notional going rate whereby the rate of interest is pitched at half, and, therefore, if the going rate comes down can we have some assurance that this rate of interest will also come down? It is obviously difficult for the Minister to be too specific, but can we have some assurance that this will be kept under close review?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first point raised by the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) concerned a sale by agreement to a local authority where the deduction is not sufficient to meet the final tax liability and an excess payment has to be made by the taxpayer to the Revenue.<br><br>
The answer is that the reckonable date runs three months from the date of exchange of contracts. Interest will run from the end of that three months, but only on the excess amount. There will be no interest charge on the amount deducted under the formula. Interest will be charged only on the excess. If under the formula deduction £50,000 tax is deducted, and after the calculations have been made a further £10,000 is owing to the Inland Revenue, interest will be payable only on that £10,000 as from the reckonable date, the reckonable date being three months from the exchange of contracts. I hope that explanation answers the hon. Member's point and satisfies him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It answers it, but it does not satisfy me. Rather than pursue the matter now, may I ask the Minister to think carefully about what he said and whether it constitutes a fair situation? I do not think that it does.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1445</span>
<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has not made it clear why he thinks that is unfair. I accept that he may say that all of this is unfair, but why is that unfair any more than the other provisions of the Bill? We are charging interest only on the excess. It is like a private sale. The excess could be in some way equated to a figure arising from a private sale. We have provided for the net of tax arrangements. The charging of interest—quite rightly so—cannot be different.<br><br>
I do not see why that is unfair if one accepts that the other positions are not unfair.<br><br>
On the point raised by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) about compensation payments, there is a slight difference between a compensation payment and DLT liability. The compensation payment could well be a substantially different figure. I shall look into the point about the rate of interest and whether it is charged on compensation payments, but it could be a completely different figure. There could be a compensation payment of £100,000 but the DLT liability might be £10, to take an extreme case.<br><br>
Therefore, I cannot go all the way with the right hon. Member and say that there could be a paradox or contradiction here. We are discussing two different payments. Sometimes, of course, the compensation payment and the DLT payment are close, but usually the realised development value would be less than the compensation payment. We are not dealing with exactly the same situation, but I shall find out what the compensation payments are and whether there is a discrepancy.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) asked for an assurance that the rate of interest would come down if interest rates fell. The only assurance I can give is that such matters are kept under constant review. When interest rates come down this will no doubt be reviewed. There is no question of penalising anybody. The intention is to bear interest rates in mind and arrive at a fair balance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Ministers dilemma. Under the administration, of his party, it is highly unlikely that interest rates will come down. I can understand why he can give no
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1446</span>
assurances on the matter. Perhaps under a different régime, in which the Minister will carry no responsibility, we may be able to put the matter right.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All the Minister has to do is to implement Section 89(2) of the Taxes Management Act 1970. That gives the Treasury the power to vary the rate by order. The present rate of 9 per cent. is presumably prescribed by an order which has been made at some stage by the Treasury. The figures in Section 89(1) of the Act are 3 per cent., 4 per cent. and 6 per cent., depending on the date of the oustanding tax. The fact that we now have a figure of 9 per cent. must arise from an order made at some stage by the Treasury under Section 89(2).<br><br>
It makes my hon. Friend's Amendment No. 420 all the more significant. Clearly, it is not possible to argue that there should be a separate order prescribing one rate of interest for development land tax and another rate for all other forms of unpaid tax. There is no power under Section 89(2) to do that. That is why my hon. Friend wants to write into the Bill a special rate of interest, which appears in the amendment, for unpaid development land tax. His argument for flexibility in the initial periods of the operation of the extremely complicated legislation had a great deal to commend it to me. I hope that, if my hon. Friend is not satisfied with the Minister's explanation, he will press the amendment.<br><br>
Let me make a final point about unfairness. I did not want to say anything more about the matter, but I want to make quite clear what I was saying. The taxpayer, when dealing with an exempt body which has acquired his land from him, whether voluntarily or compulsorily—it does not matter for the purpose of this discussion—is operating entirely in the dark. The local authority—I say "local authority", but there are many other bodies; let me say, the exempt authority, for instance, the North-East Housing Association—makes a deduction in accordance with the formula provisions, or it may make a deduction in accordance with the 110 per cent. provision and get it wrong. Then the Revenue and the taxpayer may have months and months of negotiations about what the correct figure of tax is over and above the local authority or exempt body deduction.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1344">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1447</span>
The Minister rightly said that we are concerned with the excess, but the excess may be a considerable amount of money if the exempt body has the figure wrong in the first place. When that happens, it is quite unreasonable for the taxpayer to be required to pay interest on that excess, starting only three months after the initial deduction was made by the local authority. That is most unfair. If an inadequate amount of tax was paid, that was not the fault of the taxpayer, nor was it necessarily the fault of the local authority, which simply followed the procedure laid down by Parliament. For the taxpayer to have an excess payment over and above that, seems unreasonable.<br><br>
I should have thought that the correct procedure was for any excess tax to begin to run from the date on which the Revenue raises a provisional notice of assessment to the taxpayer over and above what he has already paid to the local authority. That would be fair. If the local authority has deducted, say, £½ million, the Revenue considers that there is another £200,000 worth of tax to pay, and it eventually serves a formal notice of assessment on the taxpayer, I should have thought it fairer that interest ought to begin to accrue from that date. However, there is no amendment to that effect, so I merely put the thought in the Minister's mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following on that point, and recognising that the question I would like to put to the Minister is more related to the previous amendment than to this amendment, but as the rate of interest is so linked to the point from which it starts to run, I hope, Mr. Crawshaw, that you will allow me to ask this question now.<br><br>
I merely ask the Minister again why he has not accepted that the point from which the interest runs is the due date, as defined in the Act; and why is it not the point of assessment? Clearly, it is relevant to the rate of interest. If we could be clear about why he has not taken his own definition, we would not feel so strongly about the rate of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought I had dealt with that point. I said that we had chosen the reckonable date in order to speed up the matter, and not the date of assessment. The date of assessment could be a considerable time afterwards. We all know that professional advisers
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1448</span>
are busy people and that it sometimes takes them a long time to deal with these matters. I am not criticising anybody, but we chose the reckonable date in order to speed up the matters and to get them resolved, which is surely in the interest of everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I realise that I am in danger of getting out of order, Mr. Crawshaw, but why, then, define the due date in the way that it has been defined?</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 241, in page 143, line 50, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'24. In section 90 (disallowances of relief for interest on tax)—
<ol>
<li>for "Interest" there shall be substituted "(1) Subject to subsection (2) below, interest"; and</li>
<li>after "purposes" there shall be added "(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), interest payable under section 86A above may be deducted in computing the profits or losses of any trade which consists in or comprises the carrying out of construction operations, where 'construction operations' has the meaning attributed to that expression in accordance with section 71 of the Finance (No. 2) Act 1975."'.</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 242, in page 143, line 50, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'24. At the end of section 90 (disallowance of relief for interest on tax) there shall be added the follwoing words:—</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>"so, however, that in the computation of the profit or loss of any person from a trade comprising the sale of land after development by him (that is to say, the construction or substantial reconstruction of buildings thereon), nothing in this section shall prevent the deduction of any interest payable by him under section 86A above in respect of development land tax chargeable by reference to the disposal of an interest in land owned by him for the purpose of that trade."'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is related to the ones we have discussed, so I shall not take too much of the Committee's time. You have wisely decided, Mr. Crawshaw, to take at the same time Amendment No. 242, because, although the wording of the two amendments is different, their purpose is almost precisely the same.<br><br>
That purpose is to incorporate in the Bill a provision to apply to companies. There is a swingeing penal rate of interest
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1345">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1449</span>
applying over great lengths of time; there are problems of valuation and problems of appeal; the Bill is totally misguided in the flexibility of the appeal procedure that it allows. The Minister, in answer to me, said that the Government want to get things moving and hence to start the interest being paid quickly. A much fairer way to get things moving would have been to accept the point we made last night—to try to speed up the appeal procedure. This would be a much less <i>dirigiste</i>—a less bullying—method of getting the procedure moving, as it has to be, but we did not succeed. It is unfair that the entire burden imposed by the Government's desire to get things going should be all on one side. Companies will be hit, in many cases, if the amendment is not accepted, by having to pay over 100 per cent. tax.<br><br>
I do not want to labour this argument, which we have made on previous amendments, but one more point has to be made. I go back to something that my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) said right at the beginning of our proceedings, which seems a long time ago. We have all aged since then, though I do not know whether that is the case with the Minister. He raised the question of the incentive to bring forward land. Here we have the issue of incentive to develop. The Government have already knocked out all incentive, for instance—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Full stop.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend says "full stop", quite rightly. But, for instance, in the renting of flats. We all know what has gone on there as the result of Government edict and interference. "Development", for various reasons has become, most unfortunately, a dirty word—it is quite extraordinary—like the words "profit" and "incentive". It is almost a joke, as we follow the terminology of Socialism down its inexorable and disastrous path. All these words, concepts, and necessary ingredients of any society which is to create wealth and move forward, are being knocked, one after another. Now the concept of development is being knocked.<br><br>
If we are to impose a taxation system on companies which effectively extinguishes all their remaining desire to develop, that is a retrogressive rather than
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1450</span>
a progressive step. A situation where there is over 100 per cent. taxation is one in which all incentive could be extinguished.<br><br>
I therefore ask the Minister to consider whether, if he does not accept our arguments about the point at which the interest on unpaid tax should start, and about the rate of that interest, at least he might allow companies to offset that interest against their corporation tax liabilities.<br><br>
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
The Minister has said that this was one form of borrowing, and used that as an argument for keeping the rate of interest relatively high. If it is considered as borrowing from the Government—which I do not think it should be—why not treat it like any form of borrowing? If this is to be treated as just another form of borrowing, which is the Minister's concept, for the purpose of this amendment one goes along with it. If it was the logic behind the previous amendment, it should be part of the logic of this amendment and it should be treated for tax purposes as any other form of borrowing. Why not allow it, as these amendments propose, to be set against corporation tax? If that is not to be the case, we are facing the grave danger of knocking out all development, which would be a bad thing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will not astonish the Committee to hear that I seek to address it on the amendments which my hon. Friend moved with such elan and panache. If there is a more dirty word than "development", or "profit", it is when those two words are combined, making "development profit". It would be difficult to imagine a dirtier expression than that, to hon. Members opposite.<br><br>
We must go back to first principles on this amendment and remember what we are talking about. The effects of development land tax, in its application to the construction business, is to pick out a segment of the overall trading profit—the development profit segment—and subject it to an 80 per cent. rate of tax, except where the lower rate of 66⅔ per cent. applies for the next three years. On top of that, we have the rate of interest chargeable under the Taxes Management Act 1970, to which I referred on the previous amendment, 9 per cent. net, with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1346">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1451</span>
no deduction of the interest when computing taxable profits under the terms of Section 90.<br><br>
It does not need much more than, say, two years' interest to be charged for the DLT, plus the interest, to amount to more than the segment of profits in question—the difference between 66⅔ per cent. and 80 per cent. I use the figure of two years. Some people might wonder why it should be two years and think that tax could be agreed in less than two years. But, given the intricacy of the questions to be settled, particularly in development, where problems arise as to what is outline planning permission or detailed planning permission and the dates to be agreed, a delay of two years may well occur before the amount of liability could be finalised on appeal. That is a perfectly normal procedure in the construction and development industry. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) is not here this morning, but if he were I am sure that, from his practical experience as a client, as opposed to mine as a builder and developer, he would say that from the client's point of view these delays and difficulties often occur.<br><br>
That is why we propose in these two amendments that the expense should be deductible. There are two versions of it. The first version indicates that the business which is to benefit from the concession should attract the definition of "construction operations" laid down by the Government in the Finance (No. 2) Act 1975 for the purpose of the deduction-at-source system for payments to subcontractors in the construction industry. I also say in passing that, although that new certificate should have come into operation on 1st April, it has not done so and negotiations are still in progress.<br><br>
The second version—Amendment No. 242—defines the business more directly by indicating that its operations involve the development of sites by construction work thereon. I do not think it matters very much which amendment is accepted by the Committee—either would do the job equally well.<br><br>
The Minister will ask "Why should the construction industry, in particular, be allowed to deduct interest payments at this source when no other business can under Section 90 of the Taxes Management Act? Why should it be singled out for this concession?" There are two answers.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1452</span>
First, we are dealing with an entirely new tax which, as regards the builder, requires the division of part of his overall trading profit. He must be concerned with the development, since it is part of that profit, rather than what the Minister calls the existing use profit—the trading profit. That is a new concept with which builders have not previously had to identify. That is all the more reason for complications and delays as a result.<br><br>
I would have preferred the Minister to accept either the previous amendment or the ones before that, rather than this one. However, the Committee has decided otherwise and we cannot look back. My right hon. Friend, the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), in the words of "The Godfather", made the Minister an innocent offer he could not refuse on the early amendments. If he had been taken up on that, we might not have pursued the others. However, the offer was refused and we all know, in "The Godfather", what happened to people who refused offers. They usually ended at the bottom of the Hudson River with cement tied round their necks, but I do not think I should pursue that.<br><br>
This is a not unreasonable amendment. The difficulties for the construction and development industry will be considerable in agreeing its tax liabilities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope I do not end up in the Hudson River with blocks of cement tied to my feet. My devotion to duty and concern for the Revenue is such that I will not yield. The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to learn that I cannot go along with this amendment. The hon. Gentleman made the point that if I was going to give way, I should have given way on the last amendment. Not having given way on the last amendment, it would be illogical of me to give way on this amendment.<br><br>
Here we are asking for special relief for, in one case, builders in general and, in the other, property developers. I do not think the amendments are exactly the same or meant to cover exactly the same kind of situation. In one case we are dealing with people who hold property as stock-in-trade—some worthy and some unworthy people. I can think of a number of more unworthy people who would seek to make property a stock-in-trade if one had that kind of relief, although I am not putting that forward as an argument.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1347">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1453</span>
The hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) will not tempt me. He said that "development" had become a dirty word. I seem to remember a Conservative Prime Minister and a Conservative Chancellor not so long ago who did more damage to property development than anybody else this century, mainly because of their lack of understanding of how the economy works. But I will not go into that.<br><br>
The main object of the amendments is to get a lower interest rate. The interest rate for companies would be reduced to 4½ per cent., given the present corporation tax rate. The hon. Gentleman looks surprised—my mathematics is not very good. I will now rely on the Inland Revenue, whose mathematics is excellent in all respects. The interest rate would be 4·32 per cent., I am told, and for individuals on the basic rate 5·85 per cent. On the top rates there is substantial benefit. The rate would go down to 1·53 per cent., so there is an element of unfairness here in that—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suspect that this is diametrically opposite to what the Minister was about to say—that those who pay the least rate of interest would be those paying the most tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment was an attempt to reduce the rate of interest for some groups in some sectors, not for everybody—not for the farmer, who has to pay development land tax; he would not benefit from this amendment. It is merely for developers and builders.<br><br>
I do not put that forward as the main argument. The main argument is the same as for other amendments. We think that 9 per cent. is a reasonably fair rate, given the need to keep it fairly close to interest rates in general.<br><br>
The argument works both ways. The hon. Gentleman says that this is a new tax and, therefore, we should give plenty of time for people to think. But, as this is a new tax, there is a great incentive for people to sit down immediately to work it out and understand the tax. If we want the tax to operate properly, it is in everybody's interest that these matters should be settled as speedily as possible. I reiterate what I said. We think that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1454</span>
9 per cent. is reasonably fair, in all the circumstances, given the level of interest rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a strange principle of philosophy to assume that, faced with a new tax, human nature is such that one will sit down and work it out at once. I should have thought that absolutely the contrary would be the case. Faced with a new problem like this, one shoves it aside and hopes that someone else will solve it. As a matter of principle, I suppose, the Minister says that he is putting on a high rate of tax so that people settle things quickly. "I do not believe in principle, but oh, I do in interest." I have not a clue where that quotation comes from—the Bigelow Papers, is it not? It seems to be the Minister's argument in this case. He certainly is not arguing on the Macaulay basis, that we have heard that 5 per cent. is the natural interest of money—I wish it were, now. He seems to be arguing that we must let the Board of Inland Revenue bully the chargeable person or the taxpayer into settling his affairs by threatening him with a high rate of interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely what the Minister is arguing, in the words of an American senator, is Gentlemen, those are my principles. If you do not like them, I have others."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Each time we say that we do not like them, the Ministers' others seem to have an even higher amount of interest. The amendments plead a special case, of course. The Minister would not be giving away any principle if he admitted that special case. Perhaps one amendment is wider than the other, but it seems to us that a similar concession should be made in respect of this tax as is made in other cases to those engaged in the business of construction and development.<br><br>
I am sure that the Minister, as he has said throughout our debates has no wish to discourage development. This is a tax on the proceeds, as it were, of development. But the Bill as a whole is not intended to discourage people from development in the way that the interest is intended to discourage them from delaying payment. When a special case of this kind is pleaded, I think that the Minister should at least consider it further

than perhaps we can go in all the details in a debate of this sort. At the moment, he has just thrown it aside and left us with no crumb of comfort.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my right hon. Friend is right in ascribing to the Minister the generous thought that he does not intend to discourage development. Certainly, though, that would seem to be the effect.<br><br>
I should like to raise two points. First, the Minister seemed to imply that our amendments were too narrow, that the problem was that we were benefiting just one particular sector, namely developers, people who make money out of developing—said with the slight sneer which always creeps in and which one has learned to expect.<br><br>
If the amendments are too narrow, I am sure that we should be most co-operative in allowing any kind of format for a wider amendment to be introduced. I agree. It probably is too narrow in benefiting just the particular section covered by the amendment. The answer to that—and the Minister may well be contemplating this—is to bring forward a wider amendment on this matter. That I could understand. I do not entirely accept what he said, or indeed what I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) was saying,</span></p>

<p>Question accordingly negatived.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 296, in page 146, line 33, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'(2A) Sub-paragraph (1) above shall not apply in relation to a disposal if—
<ol><li>the disposal is a material disposal within the meaning of section 38 of this Act; and</li>
<li>before the expiry of the period for giving notice of the disposal under sub-paragraph (1) above, the body to whom the disposal is made makes, in connection with the disposal, a payment of consideration from which it deducts a DLT deduction, within the meaning of that section.'</li></ol></p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1456</span>
<p>that there is any necessary connection between the earlier amendments and this one. This is a different amendment.</p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p>What we are suggesting here is this. As the Minister turned down the original amendments, particularly the one on interest rates, on the ground that the taxpayer was borrowing money from the State, why should not the existing tax laws as they apply to interest on borrowed money be applied in this instance as in others? That is all that we are saying. It is a different point, and one which is generalisable. I agree entirely that it should not just affect the particular group of people specified in the amendment. It should apply generally. For two reasons, therefore, the Minister seems to be heading towards a wider amendment here. First, he says that we should not just benefit this particular crowd. Secondly, he said on the previous amendment that this is borrowed money, so why not apply the rules which apply to borrowed money in this instance as they apply in other instances where a trader borrows from other sources?</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided</i>: Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Amendment No. 297, in page 148, line 33, after '(2)', insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'or sub-paragraph (2A)'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 296, to which Amendment No. 297 is consequential, seeks to insert a new subparagraph (2A). This provides that a chargeable person is not required to notify the Board of Inland Revenue of a disposal of an interest in land to an exempt body where that body has made a development land tax deduction from the consideration within a year of the disposal, the period
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1349">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1457</span>
within which notice is required to be given under paragraph 35(1) of Schedule 8.<br><br>
The object of the new sub-paragraph is to prevent duplication of notifications, as the acquiring authority will already have given an equivalent notice to the DLT office under paragraph 1 of Schedule 7. A notice will have been given to the DLT office already by the acquiring authority in the case of the exempt sale. It would therefore simply be creating more work to provide that the chargeable person also should have to send a notice. The amendment relieves the chargeable person of that obligation because the obligation will have been fulfilled and the notice will already have been sent.<br><br>
Amendment No. 297 is a consequential amendment whereby a chargeable person is not required to notify the Board of a disposal under paragraph 37 of Schedule 8 if the conditions in the new sub-paragraph are fulfilled. Again, if there has been a disposal fulfilling those conditions, the chargeable person does not have to give notification because the local authority will in any case have to give notification. It is simply to relive the chargeable person of one small administrative burden which otherwise might be imposed upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We move to Part II of the Schedule and cannot forget the problems connected with snooping. We welcome the Government's amendment. We are grateful for small mercies. It is rather obvious and I do not know why we missed it ourselves. Most of the other Government amendments we expected by tabling our amendments to which they have reacted.<br><br>
We accept the amendment for precisely the reasons that the Minister has given. I should like to add a point which he did not make—which is that if one had a compulsory notice served upon one it seems right that one should not have to go through a great notification procedure.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Amendment made:</i> No. 294, in page 146, line 44, leave out from beginning to 'begins' in line 45 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'a major interest in any land'.—[<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1458</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 427, in page 146, line 45, leave out:
<br><blockquote><p>'or permits any other person'.</p></blockquote>
I should have thought this to be an uncontentious amendment which the Minister may accept in another form of words. It is obvious that considerable problems may arise if a person other than the developer can give notice. It would clarify the matter if these words could be deleted. It is not a matter of great substance, but the amendment would improve the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not agree with the amendment. If my hon. Friend's amendment were to be accepted, where a contractor acts on behalf of a developer, the contractor would have to serve the notice rather than the developer, because the contractor under the provisions of the Bill is permitted to do the work on the site. A notice has to be served by somebody, so if the developer is not to serve it under the terms of my hon. Friend's amendment the contractor would have to serve it. That is not an entirely feasible situation for a contractor. Perhaps the Minister will be able to give a better explanation. I am glad my hon. Friend raised the matter, but at first sight it does not appeal to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). In such a situation I should have thought the developer would prefer to give the notice and not have the obligation taken from him and imposed upon the contractor. If this obligation is taken from his hands, he will not know what is happening because the contractor would carry it out.<br><br>
It is preferable that people who own major interests should give notice because they know what is happening. If I permit somebody to carry out a project of material development on my land, I am giving him legal permission. I know what is happening and as an owner of a major interest I should give the notice. If the amendment were accepted, it would lead to more confusion and difficulties for developers.<br><br>
I can see the point that the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) is making, but for better control the person who has the major interest and is able to allow somebody else to work on his
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1350">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1459</span>
land should still be under an obligation to give a notice to the Revenue. He is protecting himself and not allowing matters to get out of his control.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), who has read and studied this Bill down to the last comma, and the Minister, whose job it is to know the Bill to the last fullstop and who is fully briefed on it, they both have the matter completely wrong.<br><br>
The only person who is obliged to give a notice is someone who has a major interest in the land, so that the developer under contract to develop—the person who is permitted to go on to the land and develop—is under no obligation to give a notice. The paragraph reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"a person who, having an interest in land which is a major interest … begins or causes or permits any other person to carry out a project of material development"—</p></blockquote>
is obliged to give the notice.<br><br>
The reason for the amendment is that "permits' is an extremely vague word and difficult to prove. If someone who has a major interest in the land goes on to the land and carries out what is described in the paragraph he, having a major interest, should give the notice, not someone else who has not taken an active part. But having sat back and with knowledge of what is going on, discovers that someone else with a major interest is doing something on the land, he is entitled to say "He is the fellow who had to give the notice. True, I have a major interest as well and have not gone on to the land to stop him doing this". But to impose the obligation on someone with a major interest who does not stop someone else with a major interest developing is putting the cart before the horse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Purely for explanation, although I yield to no one in admiration for my right hon. Friend's encyclopaedic knowledge of this awful Bill, I was well aware of what the amendment and paragraph both said. What I tried to indicate was that I did not agree with the amendment, which is not a wholly unreasonable point of view.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend has the conduct of the Bill for the Opposition he has my warm support—but not on this amendment.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1460</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman said that if he is a developer there is no reason why he should give a notice, because a developer could have a major interest. If he has a major interest, he has an obligation to give a notice. As far as I understand the amendment, it proposes to remove that obligation from the person who has the major interest if he permits someone else to carry out the development. Despite the fact that a person, be he developer or not, has a major interest, if he contracts out to a subcontractor, according to the amendment, he does not have to give notice. If he does not have a major interest, the situation does not arise. I should have thought that a developer of that kind, or anybody with a major interest—especially as he may have to pay tax—would prefer to have control of the situation, rather than to have the obligation imposed upon the contractor, who may not always be as concerned about these matters as the owner of the major interest would be. That is my argument, and also I believe the argument of the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). When I said "developer" I did not mean a developer who did not have a major interest. I took it as implied that that meant a developer with a major interest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister can contribute to the reconciliation between my hon. Friend and myself. He has only to do a simple thing. My main complaint is about the word "permits" because it is a passive word. The simple phrase "gives permission" would be preferable—namely, that something active had been done and not a duty imposed on someone who has not interfered, and has therefore passively allowed something to happen. If he has done something active by the granting of permission, I should not object to the Clause.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 447, in page 147, line 21, leave out from 'may' to 'give' in line 23.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 223, in page 147, line 22, leave out from 'time' to 'give' in line 23 and insert
<br><blockquote><p>'before completion of the project'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1351">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1461</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This Amendment removes the time limit for giving notice of a reduction in the scope of a project in material development. Paragraph 36(4) of Schedule 8 allows the developer to give notice to the Board of a reduction in the scope of a project, or when part is abandoned, so that the amount of DLT to which the chargeable person became liable at the commencement of development can be adjusted and any overpaid tax refunded.<br><br>
As drafted, the Bill contains a three-year time limit within which such a notice must be given. This would not be sufficient for a large development which might take much longer than three years to complete. The amendment removes the time limit altogether.<br><br>
The amendment follows, in principle, Amendment No. 223, which also drew attention to this point but which has one or two small drafting problems and we have, therefore, tabled Amendment No. 447. That benefits the taxpayer because it gives him more time to issue a notice.</span></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the Government amendment. We recognise that there may be drafting errors in Amendment No. 223, and we are pleased that the Minister accepts the principle of our amendment. As he rightly pointed out, the purpose was to allow for a situation where a project lasts for longer than three years. The person carrying out a project should be able to change his mind about the project at any time up to the point of completion.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 224, in page 147, line 26, leave out from 'project' to 'such' in line 28 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'and such a notice shall contain'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 225, in page 147, line 31, leave out '(<i>b</i>) it is in' and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'shall be substantially'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the taxpayer is not subject to an unfair range of penalties which might be incurred even though he had no intention to defraud but has merely made a mistake, or a purely technical
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1462</span>
inaccuracy, when giving notice. We are, of course, dealing with the point at which notice must be given.<br><br>
There are an excessive number of occasions on which notices are required to be given and it is quite possible that the taxpayer might inadvertently fail to comply with the legislation. We seek to ensure that he is only caught, in a legal sense, where he positively intended to defraud. We have endeavoured, with this amendment, to reflect that intention.<br><br>
The Minister might say that the wording of the amendment does not fit the Bill, but perhaps he will give his views on this matter because we feel that throughout the schedule there are all sorts of notice obligations imposed on the wretched taxpayer and we want to ensure that it is only where he does not intend to comply with the legislation that he is caught.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These are amendments to paragraph 36(4) which allows a notice to be given of a reduction in the nature and scope of a project of material development and paragraph 4(3) of Schedule 1 which empowers the Board to make consequential adjustments to DLT assessments.<br><br>
Amendment No. 224 draws attention to a difference between the wording of notices of reductions of projects of material development, and the wording in paragraph 35(3).<br><br>
There is nothing between us on the first amendment except that the amendment deals with the situation in one way and the Bill in another. Amendment No. 224 is unnecessary because it achieves more or less the same result, but the drafting is different. It is not for me to say whether that drafting is better, but there would not be much point in burdening the draftsman, who is heavily engaged on more substantial matters relating to the Bill, by changing the present drafting which adequately deals with the position.<br><br>
Amendment No. 225 goes further and seeks to incorpporate the word "substantially". The normal form of wording in the Bill is that notices
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be in such form as they may prescribe"</p></blockquote>
—that is, the board. That is as set out in paragraphs 35(3), 36(2) and 36(6). The addition of the word "substantially" is not, therefore, justified on the grounds of consistency, and also introduces a degree of vagueness into notices which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1352">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1463</span>
result in repayments of tax. Somebody must then decide what "substantially" means.<br><br>
I can give the hon. Gentleman the assurance he seeks. It is anticipated that the prescribed forms will be quite simple, merely calling for details of the person giving the notice the situation of the land and details of disposal and variations to the project. It is also expected to contain a declaration that the particulars are correct and complete, with a warning that false statements can result in prosecution. Clearly, that is a warning which is not confined to this tax. It is a warning that the Inland Revenue puts on its forms and notices from time to time. I think that gives the assurance the hon. Gentleman is seeking. There is nothing sinister. The notices will be quite simple, and will seek information from the taxpayer, and we are in this paragraph concerned with the repayment of tax.<br><br>
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that Amendment No. 224 is not necessary and that, having had my assurance on Amendment No. 225, he will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not seem to be getting much out of the Minister this morning, but I suppose one must accept his assurance on Amendment No. 225. I accept his point concerning Amendment No. 224.<br><br>
I believe that the word "substantially" adds to the Bill rather than subtracts from it. He claims that it will make the Bill more vague and there is a minor issue between us on that. However, I do not want to press this issue and, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p>No. 297, in page 148, line 33, after '(2)', insert 'or sub-paragraph (2A)'.—[<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 236, in page 150, line 3, after 'and', insert '(<i>b</i>)'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 237, in page 150, line 5, leave out '(<i>b</i>)'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first of these amendments paves the way for the second. We do not want to make a major issue of this point, but the relevant amendment is No. 237. This itself is mis-worded, as the Minister will no doubt point out. We are trying to leave out paragraph (<i>b</i>) rather than letter (<i>b</i>). We are grateful, Mr. Crawshaw, that you have allowed us to move the amendment, although as it stands it is meaningless.<br><br>
Its intention is to make it easier for a person who has to respond to the Board. Under paragraph (<i>b</i>) he has perhaps to give a lot of information, and it might make life easier if he did not have to do so. It is a minor point, and the Minister may have good arguments against it. It is more a probing amendment than anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that it is a particularly minor amendment. It is an important amendment, and I am glad that my hon. Friend has moved it. I see no reason for it to be necessary for a taxpayer to give information in a notice about matters which have nothing to do with him. It is right that he should be required to specify, given that there is any notice procedure—to which I am not attracted—whether he holds an interest in that land and, if so, its nature. Paragraph (<i>a</i>) deals with him specifically. But paragraph (<i>b</i>), which requires him to specify
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1353">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1465</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"the name and address of any other person known or believed by that person to hold an interest in that land"</p></blockquote>
seems quite unreasonably onerous. It is not the taxpayer's job to specify other people's interests in the property, and I see no reason for his being required to provide that information. It is the duty of the Revenue to seek that from the people who they think have other interests in the property.<br><br>
I do not carry the whole schedule in my head, and I do not know whether there are penalties on the taxpayer if he specifies people whom he believes to have an interest in the land who turn out not to have an interest in the land. This is not a frivolous point. There are plenty of pieces of land where the ownership is in dispute, or where there are people who are known to have an interest but are no longer traceable. Indeed, that is one of the purposes of, for example, registration of commons—to establish what happens in cases where the title to land is in dispute. My hon. Friends who are lawyers will know more about that than I do.<br><br>
I should have thought that it was the duty of the Revenue to find out this information. It is the taxpayer's job to say what affects him, but not what affects other people. It is up to the taxing authorities to find out that information from the people directly concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My. hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) moved Amendment No. 236 as a paving amendment to Amendment No. 237. He made the fair point that anyone who is approached by the Board and asked to state whether he holds an interest in land might reasonably be required to state the nature of that interest, but that it was not right that he should have to go beyond that and be involved with other people's interests.<br><br>
It is also possible to interpret the amendments in the way that they appear on the Amendment Paper, with a different and rather important meaning. As subparagraph (1) is drafted, the Board may approach anyone who appears to hold an interest in land, and whether or not he holds an interest in land he shall be obliged to supply the name and address of any other person believed by him to hold an interest in that land.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1466</span>
If one merely moves the position of "(<i>b</i>)" at the beginning of line 5 up by two lines and puts it before "if so", that makes "if so" qualify the whole of paragraph (<i>b</i>), and therefore the person would be required to specify any other person's interest only if he already held an interest in that land himself. If he did hold an interest in that land, he might reasonably be expected to know about other people who held an interest in it. But if he did not, it seems hardly reasonable that he should be required to give information about other interests in it.</span></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to amend Schedule 8 paragraph 39(1). That paragraph, as hon. Gentlemen have said, entitles the Revenue to require information from a person who holds, or appears to the Board to hold, an interest in land. The purpose of the paragraph is to give the Board powers to obtain supplementary information arising out of notices furnished and to ascertain the owners of interests in land who have not themselves furnished a notice. The object is to find out about owners of an interest in land who might be taxable under the Bill, where there is no way in which the Board can find out about them except from someone else who may transfer land. I am advised that this power is necessary.<br><br>
I shall give one example of the circumstances in which the amendment would preclude proper inquiry by the DLT office. The DLT office may be advised, at the start of a project of material development by A, that B owns an interest in the land—that is, A tells the DLT office that he has started a project of material development and that B owns an interest in the land. But, unknown to A, B had previously made a gift or assignment of his interest in the land to C. When the DLT office made inquiry of B he would not, under the amendment, be obliged to say to whom he had given or assigned the interest. The land could pass from one person to another, and under the amendment the transferor—the person making the gift or assignment in the example—would not be under any obligation to give the information.<br><br>
I am reluctant to give any assurance to the Committee, but I am prepared to say that I shall look at the matter again to satisfy myself that these powers are necessary. They may be necessary, and I

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1467</span>
have given one example, but I am prepared to look at it without giving a definite commitment. I can understand the argument that people are being asked for information that they may not have and may not know that they have. If hon. Gentlemen are satisfied with that statement, perhaps they will consider it without withdrawing the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack Dunnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is probably aware, although it may have slipped his memory, that Section 284 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, which was passed by the Conservative Government, contains almost identical provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: For the sake of the record, I must state once again what I have said on a number of occasions in this Committee, as has my right hon. Friend. The Town and Country Planning Act 1971 is a consolidating Act, and the fact that it happened to reach the statute book during the time of the last Conservative Government has no relevance to its contents. It consolidates Acts dating back at least to the Town and Country Planning Act 1936, and possibly earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dunnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That amplifies my point. This was well recognised procedure, even before 1971.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's response was better than my introduction of the amendment. I think that he at least accepts that there is a problem. I do not want to get into the argument about the Town and Country Planning Act. Even if there is a precedent, that is not a good reason for not looking at the new situation which applies under a new piece of legislation, particularly in a case like this.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Without studying the Act, I am sure that that section is not concerned with the collection of tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a very interesting example. There have been a number of occasions in these discussions when words have been read out from previous legislation and it has been said that, because those words existed, the arguments necessarily existed under this legislation. I suspect that there will be one or two occasions later when we shall question the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1468</span>
wording of the Bill and, no doubt, we shall be told that it reflects a previous piece of legislation and has been taken directly from it. In fact, there are one or two cases coming up.<br><br>
But those are not necessarily good arguments. My hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) rightly said that there was a possibility that the words read out may well have referred to a totally different situation. I merely say that my hon. Friend the Member for Melton has convinced me that this amendment has more to it than I attributed to it in the introduction. The Minister has responded wisely, not by giving any great concession, but by saying that he accepts that there is something here and that he will look at it again. I do not think that we can expect any more than that, and, for that reason, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 238, in page 150, line 13, after 'documents', insert
<br><blockquote><p>'relative to the disposal'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following amendments:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>No. 239, in page 150, line 13, after 'documents' insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'as may be within his knowledge or in his possession respectively'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>No. 240, in page 150, line 17, leave out from 'disposal' to end of line 25.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This amendment concerns the same subject as the previous amendment, but it is a matter of greater substance.<br><br>
In line 12, the Bill, as drafted, reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"… such information and documents as may be so specified and as may be required by them"—</p></blockquote>
that is, the Board—
<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of determining"</p></blockquote>
and it then lists a whole lot of things. Those words give very wide-ranging powers to the Board to come at taxpayers for really unlimited information.<br><br>
We should like the words in Amendment No. 238 to be added. I do not think that the Minister can say that we are making generalities and making the matter very difficult. We are trying to make the wording more specific. We just want to add the words that the Board can ask for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1355">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1469</span>
documents relative to the particular disposal only. That is the innocent intention of Amendment No. 238, and I hope that the Minister will have little trouble in accepting it.<br><br>
Amendment No. 239 is on the same general subject. It concerns, again, the problems faced by the taxpayer who not only, under the Bill as drafted, receives copious demands for unspecified information or unlimited information, but is actually compelled perhaps to write off for documents which are not in his possession and which may result in a very costly procedure for him in gathering together a lot of information for the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
The point is related to the point under discussion in the previous amendment. The amendment seeks to prevent a situation whereby the taxpayer is engaged in a whole set of activities which are costly to him and which may result in a lot of paperwork which he does for the Board, when that obligation should be upon the Board.<br><br>
We are seeking to tighten the legislation and limit the responsibilities of the taxpayer to matters which are within his direct control and which are directly related to the disposal which is causing the tax. I do not think that this is a matter of great contention. The Minister has shown wisdom on a number of occasions, particularly in the last debate, in tackling this kind of problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Flattery gets one everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Rudeness has not go me anywhere this morning, so I am trying flattery now. The amendment is not an enormous issue. It improves the Bill. If we are to have the Bill, it might as well be restricted to making demands upon the taxpayer related to the specific disposal in question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) is not here, because I was about to say that even if the words at present in the Bill were contained in a bill of rights, Magna Carta and the Habeas Corpus Act, I would still want them changed in the way which my hon. Friend's amendment seeks to do. Clearly, the Bill as it stands is an improvement, and it is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1470</span>
not a question of the Revenue just marching into people's houses as they will do under the terms of the Finance Bill when enacted. At least in this case, the Revenue will write to them for this information.<br><br>
Nevertheless, we should remember that this paragraph relates to a potential criminal offence. Under the following paragraph, people are liable to fines if they fail to comply with the information which is being required in paragraph 39. There is a potential criminal offence for failure to comply with the requests for information from the Revenue.<br><br>
Clearly, the Revenue has to have adequate information to allow it to be able to assess tax properly. Nobody disputes that. It would be ridiculous to suggest otherwise. But the wording:
<br><blockquote><p>"documents as may be so specified"</p></blockquote>
—is too wide. What right does the taxpayer have under the Bill to challenge the Revenue in saying whether its specifications of particular documents were fair or not? Let us take, for example, the case which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Surrey, East (Sir. Geoffrey Howe) mentioned in the House the other day, where the Revenue decided that it ought to examine documents contained in a child's school satchel. What right has the taxpayer got in those circumstances? My hon. Friend's amendment does not say that the Revenue's powers are to be unfairly or unreasonably limited so that it will not be able to do its duty to collect tax. The amendment asks that the documents which the Revenue asks the taxpayer to supply should actually be relative to the disposal, not just anything which the Revenue chooses to specify.<br><br>
The House has always been particularly concerned to ensure that public officials do not abuse their powers, and that when they require information regarding a taxpayer or somebody paying national insurance contributions, they shall require only what is relevant to that and nothing else. There is one fear, above all, which taxpayers often have and which needs to be dispelled over and again, and that is that an inquiry by public officials into one part of their circumstances will allow information into other parts of their circumstances to spill out to different Departments of State. People will say "We do not want to give this information. We cannot see how it is in any way relevant to the assessment in question."<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1356">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1471</span>
It will not do the Revenue any harm if the Minister accepts these amendments. I am sure that the Minister will say that in practice the Revenue will want to inquire only into information which is relevant to the particular disposal. But it will do much in stamping once again into statute law and in the minds of all the citizens of this country that the Revenue will inquire into the affairs of the citizen only when the matters related are directly germane to the issue under consideration. That seems to me to be a fair and reasonable point of view and I hope that the Minister is prepared to accept it.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These three amendments seek to amend Schedule 8, paragraph 39(2). This paragraph is directed towards obtaining information and documents needed to establish whether a disposal of interest in land has given rise to DLT liability and, if so, the persons chargeable.<br><br>
I shall deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for Melton. He said that paragraph 39(2) uses the words—documents "as may be specified", and that the Revenue could specify anything that had little to do with development land that had little to do with development land tax. If the hon. Gentleman reads on, he will find that is qualified—
<br><blockquote><p>"as may be specified … and as may be required by them for the purpose of determining …"</p></blockquote>
(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>).<br><br>
If the Revenue sought documents which had nothing to do with (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), I think that the hon. Member could mount a good case to stop it from doing so. The words are not as wide as he has indicated.<br><br>
Amendment No. 238 is extremely narrow. It says documents "relative to the disposal". I am advised that that would mean that the Board of Inland Revenue would not have authority, for example, to make inquiries about matters for determining the various base values, because it would be concerned just with documents relative to the disposal. Such documents would presumably be the conveyance and the contract. We would have to make inquiries into the different base values. It would thus limit inquiries into avoidance devices and make it difficult to find out whether a disposal should lead to the termination of an arrangement for
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1472</span>
paying by instalments tax charged on the start of a project of material development. There would not be a disposal at that point, but one would want to know more than the documents relative to the particular disposal.<br><br>
Although on the face of it the amendment is attractive to hon. Gentlemen, it is extremely narrow and is confined specifically to documents relative to the disposals. That is why I cannot advise the Committee to accept it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the tenor of the Minister's remarks that he thinks it not unreasonable to define the documents but that the definition given in Amendment No. 238 is too narrow? If that were the case, I am sure that the Minister could give us encouragement by saying that he would consider whether a definition of documents relating the other matters which he has discussed might be acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must deal with amendments as they arise. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to table a wider amendment dealing with other matters, he is entitled to do so. I do not think that I can draft that amendment for him. My argument was that Amendment No. 238 is particularly narrow, though this may not have been intended. Following on the point raised by the hon. Member for Melton, the words of the paragraph, although wide, are not quite as wide as perhaps hon. Gentlemen have appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister leaves Amendment No. 238, I should like to add to what my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) has said. On several occasions throughout our discussions the Minister has accepted that the wording of an amendment might not have been correct and that he might therefore need to bring forward different words, but it has not been the stand upon which he has based his previous arguments—merely to take the narrow view of the wording and, if there is a fault in it, turn down the amendment. It is the principle behind the wording which is important. As a reasonable person the Minister usually accepts this.<br><br>
It there are wide-ranging powers, one should at least try to find a form of wording which restricts the demand for documents to the issue in question. For example, if base value calculations are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1357">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1473</span>
prohibited under the terms of this wording, let us think of other words to cover the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is this an intervention or a speech? The point I am making is that the hon. Gentleman can bring forward other wording. It may be more difficult than he envisages, because the amendment does not enable the Board to discover anything that the taxpayer would not want the Board to discover. The hon. Gentleman may come back with different wording, but the wording in the schedule is not as wide as hon. Members have tried to make out. I cannot accept Amendment No. 238. It is not a question of wording; it is a question of what documents one wants to cover, and the wording is then framed accordingly. Amendment No. 238 does not do that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 239 limits the information and documents which may be required from a person to those
<br><blockquote><p>"as may be within his knowledge or in his possession respectively".</p></blockquote>
We think that the legislation would provide that, anyway, but I can see there is a case here for setting it out clearly. I am prepared to accept Amendment No. 239 in principle, but to draft an amendment for Report which would cover documents "in his power" as well as "in his possession". The words "power" and "possession" are fairly well known, not only in taxation Acts but in rulings of the Supreme Court. I am prepared to accept in principle the point behind Amendment No. 239 and to bring forward an amendment on Report to specify documents
<br><blockquote><p>"in his power or possession."</p></blockquote>
I think it would mean that, anyway, but it is better to set it out in legislation, as in the Taxes Management Act 1970 and other fiscal legislation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 240 seeks to remove paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) and to curtail the powers of the Board to obtain information. The information the Board would not be able to obtain if Amendment No. 240 were accepted is, for example, title to exemptions, such as on grounds of residence. If a person claimed that a house was a main residence, if Amendment No. 240 were accepted the Board would not have power to ask for title to find out whether it was a main residence. If we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1474</span>
accepted Amendment No. 240, the Revenue would not be able to find grounds for deferment of liability. I do not see why it should not be given that power if a taxpayer is claiming exemption.<br><br>
If Amendment No. 240 were accepted, I am advised that the Revenue would not have the power to find whether a person had made other disposals in the same financial year, which could affect his entitlement to the £10,000 exemption and the lower rate tranche. That is important because of the £10,000 exemption. Also, given the application of Part IV of Schedule 8, whereby tax may be recovered from the beneficiaries under trusts, estates or from associated companies, if Amendment No. 240 were accepted there would not be powers to obtain that information. That would be wrong. It is only fair to have that information when a taxpayer is claiming exemption.<br><br>
I cannot accept Amendments Nos. 238 and 240, but I am prepared to accept Amendment No. 239 in principle, altering the words to "power or possession".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister does not share the obsession of some of his colleagues about snooping in relation to tax matters. We know only too well the attempted introduction in another Bill. At least we have had some recognition by the Minister that the snooping provision here—I call it that for want of a better word—is fairly restrictive. The Minister intends it to be restricted to this purpose.<br><br>
We are grateful for the hon. Gentleman's acceptance of the principle in Amendment No. 239.<br><br>
I think my hon. Friend would agree that Amendment No. 240 is a probing amendment to see exactly what was expected by the Minister. The Minister said that paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are restrictive rather than widening the information required by the Board and which the taxpayer would want the Board to have.<br><br>
Returning to Amendment No. 238, it may be that the amendment is not in the right place, but it expresses the intention of the Minister himself. It is true that following the word "documents"—where this amendment would fall—there is something specific in the definition of those documents. It is
<br><blockquote><p>"documents as may be specified".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1358">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1475</span>
Friends, will press this matter to a Division.<br><br>
There is nothing very specific about that, because the Board could specify anything. But it continues
<br><blockquote><p>"and as may be required by them for the purpose of determining—"</p></blockquote>
and so on. The word "required" really does not restrict the Board in its demands for documents. If we had the idea of Amendment No. 238 embodied there, rather than the word "required", this would suffice. The Minister is being given advice at the moment about the word "required". I know that it is used in many cases and that if an official, whether it be the Board or some other official, is given power to require something, he is under some obligation to show that the requirement is relative to the information which he has an obligation to obtain in order to make some calculation or assessment. Nevertheless, this would give power to the Board to go pretty wide in its demands on the taxpayer. If the Minister would just go that little bit further than he has gone in accepting Amendment No. 239 and say that he will consider the principle behind Amendment No. 238, we should be a lot happier. At the moment, he has just thrown out the proposal. To my mind, the clause is left far too wide by the unrestricted use of the word "required" later in the same line.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any Government in any society can always find good reasons why they should have unlimited powers to request any information from the citizen, so I am not surprised that the Minister can come forward with a brief which justifies this particular wording. But I absolutely agree with my right hon. Friend when he says that it is quite unjustified to say that there is any great limit imposed by this wording. The wording is limitless. Although, as I say, a Government, particularly a Socialist Government, can—and always do—find reasons for attributing to themselves unlimited powers, there is no reason why the rest of us should go along with that. Nor is there any reason why the rest of us should go along with the argument that, because the wording of our amendment is wrong, the sense behind it is wrong and so the Government do not have to respond to the sense behind it. The Government, when they so choose, respond to the sense of an amendment rather to its wording.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1476</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will not let it be thought that all of us consider that the wording of the amendment is wrong. The Minister considered that the wording of the amendment was wrong because it did not allow him to do certain things that he wanted to do. That is not necessarily an argument which should appeal to us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I could not agree more with my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). I was just trying to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt in this matter. In Amendment No. 239, for instance, which of course we are delighted that he has accepted, he has accepted not the wording but the principle, as he himself said. It is totally inconsistent to say that in the case of Amendment No. 239 he will accept the principle, but in the case of Amendment No. 238 he is turning it down because the wording is not right.<br><br>
I was delighted to hear what my right hon. Friend had to say in support of this amendment. We contend that powers are being given to the Board under this immensely complicated Bill to make limitless demands upon the taxpayer with respect to the documents that he has to furnish to the Board. We further contend that it would be perfectly possible to incorporate the spirit of the amendment, which would restrict the information that the taxpayer has to supply to those aspects of the discussion between himself and the Board which relate to that particular disposal. If the words are indeed wrong—if they do, for instance, exclude any reference to base values or whatever—let us find a form of words which incorporates the spirit of the amendment. I am sure that we can find some adjective to put before "the disposal". I shall not start drafting on my feet. That is something that the Minister does not do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Put it in an amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we should huddle together afterwards on this and find some form of wording which would meet the spirit of the amendment. I do not think that it is good enough for the Minister to say that because he cannot find the right words that he will not accept the spirit.<br><br>
I hope that, if the Minister cannot give us something better than he gave us at the beginning, my right hon. and hon.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1359">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1477</span>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gntleman does not do justice to his case by pitching it too high when he says that there will be limitless demands on the taxpayer. That is not true.<br><br>
In his argument the right hon. Gentleman quoted sub-paragraph (2):
<br><blockquote><p>"such information and documents as may be specified".</p></blockquote>
He went a little further than his hon. Friend and read the next few words:
<br><blockquote><p>"as may be required"—</p></blockquote>
then stopped. He said "the word 'required', and who knows what they may require." But he should read on—
<br><blockquote><p>"as may be required by them for the purposes of determining "—</p></blockquote>
followed by a list of items:
<ul>
<li>"(<i>a</i>) whether an interest in that land has been disposed of and whether any realised development value has accrued on the disposal; and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) whether any realised development value which has accrued … and</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) if any realised development value which has accrued … the amount of that tax and the person or persons who may be liable for that tax."</li></ul>
Those are specific words limiting the documents that may be asked for. If the Inland Revenue asked for general documents, I would not give the matter five minutes in the Court of Appeal</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 414, in page 153, line 25, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'(<i>c</i>) the disposal by a person carrying on a trade where the land comprised in the disposal was used at any time for the purposes of carrying on a trade'.</p></blockquote>
We are now getting on to the home straight.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure my hon. Friend that there are plenty of fences yet.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1478</span>
<p>before Lord Denning. These words limit the situation clearly. It is ridiculous for the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South to say that these are limitless powers. The words in this sub-paragraph meet the point. If the hon. Member prefers other words, let him table an amendment. But my case is that (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) sufficiently limit the documents that can be asked for to give a proper protection to the taxpayer. The hon. Gentleman's amendment merely said relevant to the disposal, which makes no sense. If hon. Gentlemen say these words should be limited further, let them table an amendment.</p>
<p>These words provide considerable power for anybody who thought he was being suborned by the Revenue to say to the courts that these documents cannot be required for the purposes of determining (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) because they are not documents that relate to anything in (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). I have little doubt that the Revenue would have a bloody nose in such a situation.</p>
<p>Hon. Gentlemen are making heavy weather of this. I am prepared to accept Amendment No. 227, but not the other.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 8.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was intrigued by the reaction of Labour Members who have done so much during our proceedings, by jumping up day after day, hour after hour, in the interests of improving this terrible Bill. As a result of those strenuous efforts, they are of course getting tired. We are moving on now to the complicated question of the instalment procedures as defined in the schedule and redefined in the copious Government amendments that have come forward in the last few days.<br><br>
This amendment attempts to extend payment by instalments beyond the present
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1360">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1479</span>
restrictions which concern deemed disposals and part disposals connected with the granting of rents and leases, to a wider range of categories. I admit that its purpose is largely probing, although we shall come later to some far more specific amendments.<br><br>
I ask the Government why the restrictions outlined in this part of the schedule should be applied in the way they are. We shall be interested to hear the Government's reaction to the idea of extending the limits within which election can be made for instalment payment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will look favourably at the amendment. The categories in Schedule 8, paragraph 43(2), seem surprisingly limited. We come back again to the person—say an industrialist—who is extending his own property. We all know that the right to pay by instalments will be given to the taxpayer who is a developer or a landowner and who comes within the categories of (<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) in sub-paragraph (2).<br><br>
As I understand the amendment, here we have a situation of
<br><blockquote><p>"the disposal by a person carrying on a trade where the land comprised in the disposal was used at any time for the purposes of carrying on a trade".</p></blockquote>
The implicit understanding there is that the trade which he is carrying on is not the trade of development. It emerged in the debate on an earlier amendment that one mainly had in mind the case where an industrialist extends his enterprise on land which he himself owns, and a liability to development land tax might accrue. In such circumstances, I hope that the businessman who is not basically in the trade of development, or who is not basically a land vendor, may also have the right to elect to pay by instalments under paragraph 43(1).<br><br>
The Minister may say that that will happen, which is fair enough. However, my hon. Friend is right to put down this marker—that persons who are not solely in business for purposes of development should have the same right to pay by instalments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In moving the amendment the hon. Gentleman indicated that he was concerned about a situation where he would want tax to be payable by instalments even where there was an actual disposal. That is how I read the amendment.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1480</span>
The purpose of the instalment provisions in paragraph 43 is to cover the situation where the realisation of development value on which the DLT is charged does not provide the chargeable person with an immediate cash benefit out of which to pay the tax in one sum. When land is sold outright, the consideration for the sale will normally be received by the date when the tax becomes payable. As I understand the amendment, it proposes to enable a person who disposes of land, where that land has been used for the purposes of trade, to spread the tax over eight years, or over 15 half-yearly instalments, and to incorporate into that the present provision in regard to deemed disposals where no money is forthcoming.<br><br>
We have debated this on several occasions. Our view is that, where there is a deemed disposal, there should be a charge but the charge should be mitigated by the provision of instalments. Where there is an actual disposal providing cash, we do not feel it would be right, when the taxpayer has the money, that he should be entitled to spread the payment of tax over eight years.<br><br>
In other provisions in fiscal legislation it is provided that the payment of tax shall be spread but, as far as I am aware—there may be some exceptions—in most cases where money is not forthcoming such as where a gift is made, and capital transfer tax might apply, there are spreading provisions. The hon. Gentleman is seeking a spreading provisions scale where money has been received. I do not think it will come as a surprise to the Committee if I say that I cannot accept the amendment.<br><br>
If the money has been received, subject to all the normal rules of computation, I see no reason why the tax should not be paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that we always press this question of payment by instalments or payment deferred in a case where the cash is not in the hands of a chargeable person. There will be difficulty for him and hardship if he does not have the money for the tax. This might occur in the obvious case of a deemed disposal.<br><br>
In the amendment we have set out this special case of the trader who is disposing of premises on which he has carried on his trade. If he is retiring at that time, I suppose one need not complain. He has the cash. He is not continuing his trade.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1481</span>
Therefore, he should pay the tax from the proceeds of the sale of his trading premises. But in nine cases out of 10 the trader will find a business somewhere else to carry on his trade. He is faced with the problem of finding other premises, probably at the same sort of price as those which he has vacated and sold or possibly has been obliged to sell by compulsion from an exempt body. It would be a great hardship to him if out of the depleted money for which he has sold his trading premises he has to find other trading premises.<br><br>
I agree that this is related to other amendments which we have discussed not only in relation to instalments, where the cash is not in hand, but also where we we have talked about roll-over. This is closely related to the type of case we have in mind here.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1482</span>
One should have added to this paragraph in Amendment No. 414 some statement about using that cash for setting up in business again or continuing his business. That was our intention.<br><br>
I have no objection to the trader who closes down, retires and has in hand the money for which he has sold the premises, being charged tax for payment at once. But where he is faced with the problem of continuing his trade and getting other premises in which to carry out that trade, the Minister might be reasonable and give some concession to that man—if he asks for it—</span></p>
