PROJECTS OF MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee rose at One o'clock I was in course of moving Amendment No. 24, in page 74, line 37, leave out 'no'.<br><br>
We are also discussing, as had been explained, the following amendments: No. 25, in page 75, line 16, leave out:
<br><blockquote><p>'Without prejudice to paragraph 8 above'</p></blockquote>
and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'As an alternative to the provisions of paragraph 8, sub-paragraphs (1)(<i>c</i>) and (2) above'.</p></blockquote>
No. 26, in page 75, line 18, leave out 'shall' and insert 'may elect to be'.<br><br>
These amendments combine to make a comprehensive amendment.<br><br>
Without getting out of order, I hope to refer back to earlier discussions we have had, and to refer on in order to find some definitions. To refer back first, we had a very comprehensive debate on Clause 2 and discussed the sort of interests in land which were covered by the provisions of Clause 2. Some of them reappear in paragraph 8(2) of Schedule 1. It is to those that paragraph 8(1)(<i>c</i>) applies. That paragraph states that when they are assessing
<br><blockquote><p>"the market value of an interest in land immediately before a project of material development is begun"</p></blockquote>
we should take no account
<br><blockquote><p>"of any interest which is an incumbrance falling within sub-paragraph (2) …".</p></blockquote>
Thus we disregard those incumbrances entirely in ascertaining the market value.<br><br>
The ascertainment of market value governs the amount of the development value, which itself, governs the amount of tax to which the person will be chargeable. Let us assume that a freeholder carries out a deemed disposal—that is,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 248</span>
he starts a project of material development, Then if paragraph 8 of Schedule 1 applies, we assess the market value of the interest that he is deemed to dispose of at that moment and to re-acquire at the same moment without taking regard of these other interests of the person who is entitled to the benefit of an easement or of the benefit of a restrictive covenant.<br><br>
Those interests are bound in practice to reduce the value of the freehold of that land, or even if it is a leasehold that the developer is holding. If there are those restrictions, they in fact reduce the market value of the land. It is thus a fiction if we say that they are not to be taken into account for otherwise we are valuing the land at a greater value than in fact it is worth. Therefore, the chargeable person—in my example, the owner of the freehold who is carrying out the development—will be charged on the basis that these interests do not exist.<br><br>
But Clause 2 tells us that we must take some of those interests into account and that the person who is entitled to the benefit of them will be assessed to development land tax. It thus seems that there would be a form of double taxation.<br><br>
I am leaving for a moment a matter which comes later, namely, contingent liability, but taking it up to that stage, in Clause 2 we value the benefit of having an easement over land, or having a restrictive covenant, and then we are told that the subservient owner—the owner of the land which is subject to the easement or restrictive covenant or other right expressed here—will pay on the basis that it does not exist.<br><br>
The excuse for that is that if eventually he has to pay to remove the easement or the restrictive covenant, he is entitled to treat that as a contingent liability. Up to that point one can say "It is true that you have been charged tax on the basis that you will not be liable to pay out for this other interest, but when you pay out for it you will be entitled to bring that into account and treat it as a contingent liability." That means, of course, the possibility of his paying tax and then having to reclaim it eventually when a payment out is made.<br><br>
The story does not end there. Contingent liability does not really mean contingent liability at all. I shall spare the Committee returning to Humpty
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0703">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 249</span>
Dumpty and "Through the Looking Glass" and saying that the words mean what I intend them to mean and do not take any notice of what they are; I make the words that I use do a lot of work—I am not quoting that quite correctly, but it was the gist of Humpty's statement to Alice.<br><br>
We are referred to Schedule 2 to find out what one does about contingent liabilities. Paragraph 22(1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In determining for the purposes of this Act the consideration for the disposal of an interest in land, no account shall be taken, in the first instance, of any contingent liability assumed by the chargeable person, by the person acquiring the interest or by any other person."</p></blockquote>
In assessing the market value—that is, in assessing the consideration—no account is to be taken of the contingent liability.<br><br>
So no account is to be taken of the other interests in the land, such as easements and restrictive covenants, but they are to be treated as contingent liabilities, and then no account is to be taken of contingent liabilities. I am completely puzzled as to what happens.<br><br>
I go on to Schedule 2(22)(2) which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"If it is subsequently shown to the satisfaction of the Board that a contingent liability which was not taken into account in determining the consideration for a disposal has become enforceable and is being or has been enforced, such adjustment, whether by way of a further assessment or the discharge or repayment of tax or otherwise, shall be made as is required in consequence."</p></blockquote>
That is a rather vague statement, but it seems to say that account shall be taken of the contingent liabilities when they bite and when one has to pay. They are contingent liabilities that have not been taken into account in assessing the market value but one has taken them into account under Schedule 1(9).<br><br>
Where are we? At one stage we are told that the other interests in land will be valued and assessed and development value of them will be charged to tax against the person who owns them. Next, we are told that they will not be included in the market value of the freeholder or lease-holder and, therefore, he must pay tax on them. Then we are told that if he does that he is entitled to bring them in as contingent liabilities. Further on we are told that contingent liabilities are not to be taken into account at all in considering the consideration.<br><br>
I am confused. I hope I have not confused the Committee more than I have confused myself.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 250</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). When we on this side of the Committee were considering Adam Smith's great principle of the division of labour—that is, in our case the division of labour as to who should move which amendment—I was landed with the difficult job of moving Amendments Nos. 25 and 26. That responsibility has now been taken from my shoulders, Mr. Fitch, by your grouping of them with Amendment No. 24.<br><br>
But I can refer to Amenements Nos. 25 and 26 because, although in a sense they go with Amendment No. 24, they could also be taken to be alternatives to it. Under Schedule 1(8)(1)(<i>c</i>) and paragraph 8(2) the market value of an interest is taken to be its value, neglecting any of the incumbrances, easements or covenants in paragraph 8(2). In paragraph 9(1), on deemed disposal, the taxpayer will be assumed to have accepted responsibility for the incumbrances and under paragraph 9(2), the expenditure of dealing with such incumbrances, is offset against market value.<br><br>
Although normally these arrangements would seem to be for the benefit of the taxpayer, I feel that he should be given the right to elect, as is proposed by Amendment Nos. 25 and 26, whether he wishes to be treated in this way. The reason for this is fairly plain. In certain circumstances the easement obviously could add to the value of the property, while in other cases it could detract from it. I listened carefully to the detailed explanation and consideration which my right hon. Friend gave to these confusing paragraphs. I understood him to say that easements would detract from the value of the property. That does not seem to me to be necessarily always so. There could be occasions when easements would add to the value of the property. My right hon. Friend nods; I am grateful to have his agreement. In such circumstances, where easements add to the value of the property, the right of election which we propose in Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 becomes all the more important.<br><br>
Having dealt specifically with those two amendments, I should like to stress the extremely confusing and impeding wording of paragraphs 8 and 9 which are affected by Amendments Nos. 24 to 26 inclusive. I think it was Harold Macmillan who once said that he sent
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0704">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 251</span>
anybody who wanted to hear about moral questions to an archbishop. As a humble builder, I send anyone who wants to hear about covenants or restrictive covenants to a solicitor. I do not in any circumstances try to deal with them myself. I find the duty of considering what the paragraphs mean extremely difficult. I find it even more difficult to consider what people outside, who do not have to deal with the Bill from day to day, will make of them. As my right hon. Friend said, the very wording is impeding and confusing.<br><br>
These three amendments between them give added scope to the taxpayer without necessarily altering the position of the Revenue at all. The tax will still be payable at some stage. The question is—at what stage will it be payable? Whether the valuation is initially net of incumbrances, so to speak, or gross of them; whether the procedure under paragraph 8 or paragraph 9 is followed, tax will be due if it is owing. I suggest that Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 could, in circumstances where the incumbrance adds to the value of the property, benefit the taxpayer without any loss to the Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Those who are dubious about the value of a classical education—I underwent mine a long time ago and have forgotten most of it—might recall the practice of having to translate unseen passages of obscure languages, which might help those who subsequently find themselves in that position in this Committee. I do not know, if I tried to translate into what I regard as English the meaning of this particular passage whether I should be marked for my ingeniousness or my accuracy, or perhaps neither. I admit that I am confused and my confusion is amplified, rather than removed, by my right hon. Friend's helpful remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Paymaster-General (Mr. Edmund Dell)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member should be careful with his lines. My hon. Friend the Financial Secretary was a member of the Fulton Committee.</span></p>
<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that timely reminder. Perhaps I should avoid being taken too far down the line on the virtues of certain types of education.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 252</span>
I am certainly confused. The point that particularly worries is that restrictive covenants are not to be taken into account; because restrictive covenants, in commerce particularly, and also, to some extent, in industry, can be an important part of the value of a piece of land. An example which is most familiar in commerce—I do not know if anyone here is teetotal—concerns the sale of alcohol for consumption on or off the premises. It is a common restrictive covenant, and can have a serious effect, by implication, upon the value of premises.<br><br>
This is dealt with not, as my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) suggested, by sending someone to talk to a solicitor, but by sending someone to talk to an insurance broker, because it is very common to insure against action being taken on the restrictive covenant. This type of restrictive convenant was imposed in the nineteenth century; one may try to trace the original beneficiaries or those who imposed it and deal with the matter that way, but probably one cannot. Therefore, one may feel obliged to take out an insurance, which can be a costly business depending on the weight and standing of the covenant.<br><br>
Perhaps the Financial Secretary as a, member of the Fulton Committee, is taking on the burden of replying to this debate, but I hope that whoever replies can assure us that, whichever way round it is, at some appropriate date account is taken of the effect on value of restrictive covenants and, indeed, the other matters referred to here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) asked for account to be taken of the value of restrictive covenants. Certainly, this is an important aspect of what we are discussing in this group of amendments. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) introduced his amendment by calling it an impressive amendment, to leave out the word "no". We listened with great interest to his explanation for that momentous amendment, and I must say at the outset that I admired his understanding of the Bill. The way he leapt from paragraph to paragraph was reminiscent more of a Treasury Minister, who has the advantages of a brief without necessarily the understanding, and the way that the right hon. Gentleman was able to imitate that situation, which I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0705">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 253</span>
am happy to say does not prevail on this occasion—although I have known it in the past—is a tribute to him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for those very kind words. May I say that the amendment, which was advised to me by someone else in another form, merely had a note underneath it saying "self-explanatory".</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman knows of many occasions where hon. Members on Committees have had their heads down and pursued that path, never deviating, for obvious reasons.<br><br>
As the right hon. Gentleman and the Committee have accepted, this is a very complicated area. I am not sure that I followed the leapings of the right hon. Gentleman in every particular, but I shall attempt to explain it the way I see it.<br><br>
We are here in Schedule 1 talking about a deemed disposal, and, in order to assess the market value, we have to take into account the incumbrances that have been described by the hon. Members for Hove and for Melton as well as the right hon. Member for Crosby. In the first instance, these incumbrances are disregarded and the matter is treated in that way because in most cases the developer of the property will actually be making payments to have the incumbrance removed. Consequently, there would be an adjustment to the liability for development land tax. If that is the situation, and it is, I hold that it is a perfectly reasonable way to operate.<br><br>
If the developer informed the Inland Revenue of a project which, because of an incumbrance, cannot be carried through, there may be two reasons for this. Either the incumbrance is artificial—I can see that hon. Gentlemen are beginning to understand that we are getting on to the question of avoidance problems, and this bedevils the attempt to produce simple forms of taxation, whether for land or otherwise—or the incumbrance is there and the developer expects to remove it.<br><br>
As for the first reason, we must take into account the possibility of an arrangement between the two sides, or even the creation of possible artificial incumbrances by means of which development land tax can be reduced or deferred. So we say that there is no need to take account of the value of that incumbrance. We can easily
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 254</span>
wait until the expenditure is incurred and the developer pays out for the extinguishing of that restrictive covenant or incumbrance, and subsequently arrange the taxation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Melton asked about the treatment of incumbrances as contingent liabilities. I understand the problem in this matter. The solution, as the Bill explains, is to treat such incumbrances as contingent liabilities and to allow any expenditure incurred in their removal to be taken into account when assessing their computation for the development land tax. The assessment can be adjusted accordingly.<br><br>
As for the principle, I am not unhappy about this arrangement. It is reasonable and follows the pattern of the kind of legislation we want to see. It has logic and the merit of simplicity, and provides a means of diminishing the amount of avoidance, which is bound to be substantial even at the lower rates of tax which hon. Members opposite might consider appropriate, let alone the rather higher rates that are now in the Bill.<br><br>
I see the difficulty which the right hon. Gentleman points to on the question of double taxation. I think that he considerably overstates the case. But there is the problem between the development land tax as viewed by the developer and the development land tax as viewed from the angle of the owner of that incumbrance. The difficulty is that, in order to meet that point fully in the way that the hon. Gentleman wants, we should have some very complicated legislation indeed if we are to avoid the kind of loophole created here—[<i>Interruption.</i>]—The hon. Member for Melton refers to the complications there. I can assure him that in order to meet the point that the right hon. Member for Crosby is putting forward, the complication will be very much greater.<br><br>
This is something worth looking at. Because of the complexity neither the Minister of State nor I have been able to find a solution. It may be that a solution is not possible, but I ask the Committee to accept the assurance that we shall look at it again and without any commitment perhaps come back to it on Report and then inform the House of the result of our investigations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am more than alarmed at the thought that this legislation has the merit of simplicity and that we could have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0706">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 255</span>
something really complicated. I must make representations to be elsewhere when such a Bill comes to Committee!<br><br>
I am sure we are all grateful for what the Financial Secretary has said. To my mind, the key words seem to be "to allow expenditure on extinguishment". I should be glad to know whether expenditure on extinguishment includes insurance against enforcement. I also wonder what happens when somebody who has been involved in a deemed disposal where there is a major restrictive covenant decides to take no action against it at that time—and it is not enforced for a short period—and then sells the completed development. It seems that the price he would then receive would reflect the continued existence of this restrictive covenant, and as far as I understand it—although I admit that I might be wrong—he would have been taxed on a deemed disposal as if the restrictive covenant did not exist, and will not, in the intervening period, have incurred any expenditure on extinguishing it. I should be grateful either for further consideration or better immediate guidance from the Financial Secretary on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his comments, on which my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) will obviously want to comment in a moment. Like my hon. Friend, I also view with horror the prospect of a more complicated Bill.<br><br>
I should like to get this clear in my mind. Basically, what the Financial Secretary was saying was that these subparagraphs have been put in to deal with potential avoidance problems—that is, the likely revenue from actual easements as opposed to potential avoidance easements would be hardly anything, because in most cases the easements would be of very little value. The easement of, say, a telegraph pole is not going to incur any development value, so there is no need for any tax to be assessed.<br><br>
On the other hand, presumably what the revenue invisages is a situation where say, a developer wishes to acquire a site and, in order to keep the base value down, the vendor says "You may have the site for £2,000 and the easement to use it as a liquor stall for £5,000" or some similar figure. The developer would then
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 256</span>
pay £2,000, no DLT would be payable and if the easement were not taxed, it would not be payable that way either. I can see that a loophole could quite easily exist there, and obviously the Revenue would want to prevent it.<br><br>
However, I wonder whether we are not becoming over-concerned about these possibilities of evasion and avoidance. Clearly the Revenue has a duty to defend the taxpayer as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about the individual taxpayer?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said "the taxpayer as a whole" as opposed to the individual taxpayer, because defending the taxpayer as a whole may involve attacking the individual taxpayer in some cases. The problems and bureaucracy that could accompany the procedures that are envisaged here leave the mind boggling, and in most cases the revenue would be negligible.<br><br>
I hope the Financial Secretary will be able to look at this matter again before Report. I suspect that in most cases we are talking here about no revenue at all, yet we have in the Bill all these words that have got to be understood by somebody.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for saying that he will look at the points we have raised, and I hope that he will find a solution.<br><br>
I thought it was the saying of the month when he said that this Part was drafted with the merit of simplicity. I should have thought that that was the last thing we could say in commendation of Part II of Schedule 1.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has seen nothing yet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am aware that there are more complicated provisions in the Bill which we shall reach later, but certainly this raises a number of problems.<br><br>
One that occurs to my mind is that in this part of the Schedule, we are thinking mainly of the owner of the main interest, if I may so call it, in the land. We are saying that when we discuss the market value of the one who has the main interest, we shall not take into account the lesser
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0707">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 257</span>
interest. I will not use the term "minor interest" because that is a term of art in the Bill.<br><br>
5.0 p.m.<br><br>
What happens if the owner of the main interest is free from tax altogether, if, for example, he were dealing with stock-in-trade—land is stock-in-trade—for which there is planning permission to 12th September 1974? What happens if we are dealing with a dealer who is subject to income tax or corporation tax and not subject to development land tax? How will the contingent liability be taken into account in such cases if we disregarded it in assessing the market value at the point of deemed disposal?<br><br>
Could that not be considered by the Board when presented by the applicant with an election under the proposal in the amendment? In this amendment we are saying that perhaps the Bill as drafted is one way of dealing with these matters, namely, that the restrictive provisions are not taken into account at the outset, but are brought in later when payment is made forward.<br><br>
Incidentally, how one brings in any land obligation within the meaning of Section 1(2) of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970, I do not know. I am sure that the Financial Secretary knows exactly what is meant by that. If he does not, I have a feeling that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) will tell him.<br><br>
Suppose that there is a Scottish owner who has the benefit of such an obligation. It is not taken into account in the market value, but that does not matter because we are assuming that the owner of the main interest in the land will not be liable. It is his stock in trade. What do we do about this fellow who owns this Scottish right? It has not been taken into account. Do we merely charge him with tax? Or does it remain a contingent liability against no liability at all?<br><br>
We are asking that there should be an election in this case so that the owner of the main interest should be able to say "I will accept the provisions of the Bill. You disregard these lesser interests in making an assessment of the market value and I will come in and claim at a later date for what I have to pay to get rid of those interests."<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 258</span>
Alternatively, that owner could say "Please take them into account now in assessing the market value and I will abide by that assessment for future dealings in the land and future assessments of market value." If the Board then thought that there was some effort at evasion here, as in the example given by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), the Board could say "No we do not agree to that election". That is not in our amendment as it stands, but it is a matter of refinement which could be brought in at a later stage.<br><br>
If the Financial Secretary is looking at this matter again, I hope he will do so from the point of view of election. We are not asking him to remove the whole of the provisions in the Bill. That may be the right way to deal with some cases, but let us give the owner of the main interests in the land who is to carry out the development, and who has caused the deemed disposal, an election as to how these other interests are dealt with, so far as he is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is important that we hear from the Financial Secretary what the Government imagine is meant by the effect of paragraph 8(2)(<i>d</i>).<br><br>
I hope, Mr. Crawshaw, that I am a reasonable man. Even in the law of Scotland the reasonable man is defined as the man on the top of the Clapham omnibus. That may have the effect of accepting the Minister of State and myself from being reasonable in any way, as neither of us has anything to do with Clapham, and we are better than those who travel by bus. Nevertheless, I think we should test the meaning of this because we are a legislature. We are passing into law matters that affect ordinary people, and the rights of people, and it is right that those who legislate, such as the members of this Committee—be they lawyers or not—should comprehend what is meant by what the Government intend. One of the shames of Parliament has become the fact that Government Ministers of any party have become the quacking ventroloquist's dummies of the Bench that serve them. And if there is a little "Oh!" from one bench in the back of the Clapham omnibus, let me just see whether the "Oh" continues to be made when we try to see what this means.<br><br>

Schedule 1(8)(1) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In determining for the purposes of this Act the market value of an interest in land immediately before a project of material development is begun".</p></blockquote>
I think we can all understand that part. Schedule 1(8)(<i>c</i>) then says:
<br><blockquote><p>"to the extent that it would restrict the doing of anything comprised in the project"—</p></blockquote>
I imagine I have lost most people already. It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"no account shall be taken of any other interest which is an incumbrance"—</p></blockquote>
—whatever that means; it is a term unknown to the law of Scotland—
<br><blockquote><p>"falling within sub-paragraph (2) below"</p></blockquote>
So we read sub-paragraph (2). It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The incumbrances"—</p></blockquote>
I would love to ask Labour Members to stand up and tell me what that means:
<br><blockquote><p>"The incumbrances referred to in sub-paragraph (1)(<i>c</i>) above are the following"—</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I continue:
<br><blockquote><p>"so far as they subsist immediately before the project of material development is begun and affect any of the land comprised in the project,"—.</p></blockquote>
That is a sentence I would have felt to be of devious meaning and immensely bad English. I am afraid that for the Scottish Nationalist, absent once more, there is only one word for the language we all speak—and it is English—"lamely". We move to the Scottish matter—if I have not already lost it. Paragraph 8(2)(<i>d</i>) states:
<br><blockquote><p>"any land obligation within the meaning of section 1(2) of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970".</p></blockquote>
Now, before we see what that says we have to go back to where we started, which is Clause 2(2). That says:
<br><blockquote><p>"shall have effect for determining what is a project of material development, what land is comprised in such a project and at what time such a project is to be treated for the purposes of this Act as begun, and Part II of that Schedule shall have effect with respect to deemed disposals and re-acquisitions."</p></blockquote>
We then have to come to Section 1(2) of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970).<br><br>
I noticed recently in the Press a proposal by a schoolmaster that exams should be abolished. But I should like to set a little exam for Government Ministers. The only trouble is they would fudge it, because they would not answer any of the questions, and they would say "We get
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 260</span>
100 out of 100 anyway." But I would like to ask each member of this Committee—and I think it is an important and serious point on which we are legislating—what he imagines this section means and excludes. The answer is that most hon. Members would earn no marks out of 100, and the least we could put on the Minister's report would be "Tried from his crib, but failed."<br><br>
Let us look at Section 1(2) of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this section and of section 2 of this Act a land obligation is an obligation relating to land which is enforceable by a proprietor of an interest in that land"—</p></blockquote>
and the Minister will no doubt remind me whether that is a <i>dominium utile</i> or is or is not feudal land—
<br><blockquote><p>"which is enforceable by a proprietor of an interest in land, by virtue of his being such a proprietor, and which is binding upon a proprietor of another interest in that land, or of an interest in other land, by virtue of his being such a proprietor".</p></blockquote>
I am not entitled to ask hon. Members to get up one by one and ask them what that means. However much they may nod, I know the truth of the matter. None of them knows. It is shameful that Parliament should pass legislation which its Members do not understand.<br><br>
I am the mystical possessor of the fantasy of Scotland, in the absence of the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford), who is so frequently in Perth and East Perthshire that when he makes speeches there he happens to be in London at the time, and when he is on duty in the House of Commons he happens to be in Perth and Eash Perthshire at the time. He has a universal capacity for absence.<br><br>
Given that I am the only person who has been permitted to know the secrets of Scots law, and that it is in a language like Gaelic which only those who have some deformity of mind can comprehend, I should be glad if the Minister in all seriousness could tell us what it is meant to include. In my opinion this legislation is utterly meaningless. It is abstruse, capable of almost any interpretation, and it will make bad law. The fact that it is justified by any moral stance, any rightness of the tax in the first place, does not justify passing bad law on to the Statute Book. It is bad because it is incomprehensible, bad because those who propose it do not understand it, and bad because

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 261</span>
the Committee that has to rubber-stamp it does not understand it either. If we can be told in language which the Clapham, omnibus qualifying passengers can understand, I shall be delighted. I should be infinitely more surprised if that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure what marks I shall be given for what I am about to say, but I am certain that my colleagues might give me a higher mark than the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn). Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will say that that is because I do not understand the matter as well as he does.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I grant that from the outset. I do not understand it.</span></p>
<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman is stating that his lack of knowledge of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 is somewhat less than perfect, I go further and say that mine is even more inadequate to meet the particular requirements which he considers necessary in the understanding of this legislation.<br><br>
I point out, however, that what we are discussing in Part II of the schedule are the valuations. In particular we are discussing the incumbrances that modify those valuations. Some of the incumbrances are any land obligation within the meaning of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970. Insofar as there is in that Act of Parliament, and arises from that Act of Parliament, any incumbrance that can modify the valuation, that is relevant. I should be delighted to take lessons from the hon. and learned Gentleman, but on this particular occasion I do not think that I need spend too much of my time becoming an expert in these matters. Suffice it for me to accept that there are incumbrances within that Act which will modify the valuation in the way I have described.<br><br>
I think that the whole Committee was diverted by the hon. and learned Gentleman's account and, in particular, by his relationship with a member of the Scottish National Party—I might say the absent member of the Scottish National Party, for his benefit—</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 262</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And for the hon. Gentleman's.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have every confidence in my hon. Friend.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was taking a much longer-term view of the fact that it is in our interests to demonstrate the irresponsibility of that "Monty Python" party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that respect there might be certain agreement between hon. Members on both sides of the Committee.<br><br>
I revert to the point made by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). His main argument—and I am grateful for his comments—and the one to which he asked me to address my attention was that we should keep an open mind about the question of an election that can be made by the owner of a main interest who could accept certain provisions, with the lesser interest allowing the possibility of being dealt with later. Alternatively, the other possibility, is that they could be dealt with at the same time.<br><br>
I cannot go much beyond what I said earlier. There is a whole range of possibilities we would want to examine. I understand the point about over-concern attributed to the Inland Revenue by the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) concerning evasion and avoidance. But this is necessary when one is introducing a new tax. In introducing a new tax there is a whole range of new provisions untried and untested—both in the courts and in the relationship between the Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. There is ingenuity by those who are faced with taxation in the ordinary course of events and I have reason to know and even admire their misplaced dedication in these areas.<br><br>
Nevertheless, when one is talking about a completely new tax where there has been no opportunity to build up a level of expertise in the Inland Revenue, resting as it can upon the tried methods of examination of these detailed provisions over a period of many years, then perhaps a note of concern is required. I would not call it that myself. I would call it necessary prudence. If the hon. Gentleman were in the position of supporting these measures—which I understand he does in general terms—I think his concern would be little different from mine. Of course I understand that there needs to be this balance in the way he has described. I hope that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0710">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 263</span>
we shall be able to retain something of this kind. But it must await the further discussions we shall be having.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) asked about the position of the owner of the incumbrance. I cannot say much more on that at the present time except for one point. The hon. Member mentioned the expenditure on insurance. Provision is made for insurance which is allowable as an improvement. I think we have dealt with that. His other points can best be discussed when we have the further consultations which the House will be able to debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I pick up one phrase that the Financial Secretary used? He said that the whole range of possibilities would be considered. This is very satisfactory to us on this side.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps, in an absence of caution, I did not use the words "without commitment", and perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will realise that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I quite appreciate that. I ask the Financial Secretary to bear in mind that we are asking here for an election. I understood him to say that he was not particularly enamoured of that idea but that at least he would look into the whole range of possibilities which come to mind in amending a paragraph of this sort. To that extent I think he is correct in agreeing to have further consultations on this.<br><br>
I would lay down a marker at this stage. We are happy to receive assurances from Ministers that they will consider points we have raised on amendments. We are gratified that our amendments are sufficiently to the point to merit those assurances. I am worried whether we shall have full opportunity, at a later stage of the Bill, to discuss the points on which the Ministers have given us assurances and undertakings.<br><br>
For example, in this case, where the Financial Secretary says that he proposes to have further consultations, we would be grateful if, at a reasonable time before Report, he would be good enough to see that we are informed of the result of those consultations. If they come to nothing and he has to tell us that he wants to leave the Bill as it stands, not meeting us on it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 264</span>
at all, he will appreciate that we must have time to put down an appropriate amendment on Report.<br><br>
I say this, because we have suffered on Finance Bills in the past from not being informed in time of decisions taken by Ministers on matters on which they have given assurances and undertakings. It is part and parcel of an acceptance of an assurance and undertaking, such as has been given on this amendment, that we have the chance to consider it and to table an amendment, if necessary, at a later stage.<br><br>
On the question of avoidance, we recognise fully that there must, in any Finance Bill, be provisions against avoidance of tax. Indeed, I am just as keen to see that there is fairness between one taxpayer and another as about any other considerations in the Bill. We must see that one taxpayer does not get away with it while another is charged the full tax.<br><br>
We are quite happy to go along with the Government at any time on anti-avoidance provisions, provided that they are not a mallet to swat a gnat. If they are reasonable anti-avoidance provisions, we would certainly approve.<br><br>
To return to the main part of the amendment, there is a considerable need here for elucidation and a need for dealing with it in other ways than those set out in the Bill. Therefore, I am glad that the Financial Secretary intends to have further consultations and I am sure that my hon. Friends will be in agreement with me if, at this stage, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 27, in page 75, line 28, leave out paragraph 10.<br><br>
This is, in some ways, a simpler amendment to move than the previous group of amendments on which we spent quite a long time. I think it would be correct to describe this as a probing amendment.<br><br>
I turn, in hope, to the Explanatory Note for the meaning of paragraph 10, we are told that
<br><blockquote><p>"a project of material development may extend to only part of the land in which an interest is held".</p></blockquote>
That seems fairly straightforward. In that case, the deemed disposal is for technical reasons, and one starts to worry because the technical reasons do not seem
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0711">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 265</span>
to be elaborated, not treated as a part disposal within Part II of Schedule 2.<br><br>
Instead, in arriving at market value for a deemed disposal it is assumed that the interest extends only to the part being developed. Clearly, that is not, in practice, the situation as I read the Explanatory Note, because it says at the beginning that
<br><blockquote><p>"a project of material development may extend to only part of the land in which an interest is held".</p></blockquote>
We are then told, for technical reasons unstated, that we have to assume that the interest extends only to that particular part of the land. "The base value," we are told is similarly adjusted (see paragraph 18 (1) of Schedule 2).
<br><blockquote><p>"For a subsequent disposal where this paragraph has applied see paragraph 18(2), Schedule 2",</p></blockquote>
which, again, would be of interest if one could understand the part that goes before.<br><br>
I hope that we shall be enlightened not only as to the meaning but as to the technical reasons, for which we have to make an assumption which is clearly at variance with the facts.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) said that this was a probing amendment, and he has probed sufficiently to ensure that I will now read out a number of extremely complicated provisions, which at the end will no doubt make all clear to him and other hon. Members.<br><br>
Paragraph 10, as the hon. Member indicated, does not stand by itself. Not many paragraphs in this legislation do stand by themselves—they need support along the way—and it is supported by paragraph 18 of Schedule 2. Indeed, the detailed rules relating to part disposal come from paragraph 18 of Schedule 2, but paragraph 10 starts the process off, as it were.<br><br>
I thought it only right for the benefit of the Committee, and hon. Members opposite in particular, to try to put on record what the effect of paragraph 10, taken in conjunction ultimately with paragraph 18 of Schedule 2, would be. If hon. Members do not want to refer to it in detail today—for it is complicated, and I say that not in a patronising way; it is complicated for everyone—they can come back to it on Schedule 2 in relation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 266</span>
to paragraph 18, and if they wish to table amendments they can study what is on the record, which will give an indication of what is in our mind.<br><br>
Paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 introduces, as the hon. Member himself discerned, a special rule to deal with the situation where a project of material development extends to only part of the land to which a deemed disposal takes place. This kind of situation will normally occur in the case of a large development where the developer either does not wish to incur the liability for DLT in respect of the whole of the site at the time he first starts development, or where, in fact he may have planning permission which reserves detailed approval for development by reference to a time scale. For example, a developer owning 50 acres of housing land might get planning permission for residential development, but the permission would state that detailed approval was given for the erection of the first 50 houses on, say, five acres of the land, but that approval for the remainder of the site would be reserved until certain facilities had been approved or augmented.<br><br>
The natural course might be thought to be to treat the deemed disposal of part of an interest—we have seen that when there is a commencement of material development there is deemed disposal—as being a deemed disposal to which the normal part disposal rules apply.<br><br>
For example, in Clause 3 we set out certain rules regarding part disposals of an interest. This, I am told, would give rise to considerable technical difficulties.<br><br>
The rules regarding actual part disposals, not part disposals in a deemed situation, normally operate in terms of "the granted interest" in Clause 3 referred to here—that the part that has been disposed of—and "the retained interest"—that is what the original interest has become after the part disposal.<br><br>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
In other words, if we are dealing with a natural situation of a part disposal of a part of land, then the legislation envisages a situation where the granted interest of the interests are sold and the retained interest has been retained. That is not too complicated in relation to an actual disposal.<br><br>
When there is a deemed disposal, it makes the matter extremely difficult,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0712">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 267</span>
so paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 and paragraph 18 of Schedule 2 devise different rules.<br><br>
In the case of a deemed disposal, the concept of such a disposal being followed immediately by a deemed reacquisition would not fit very well into this scheme.<br><br>
Accordingly, a different approach has been adopted. It is assumed at the time of the deemed disposal of part of the owner's interest that the disposal is of the whole of his interest and, similarly, that the whole of the interest is reacquired. It would obviously not be equitable for such a deemed disposal to give rise to a liability to DLT in respect of that part of the land which is not in fact being developed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Slower!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The object of phasing a development may be to spread the tax burden over a number of years. Alternatively, it may be phased because, due to planning control, the developer can only start on part of the major project at a particular time.<br><br>
Consequently, the deemed disposal of the whole of the owner's interest is, for the purposes of arriving at the market value at the time of the deemed disposal, taken to relate only to the land within the project which has been notified. For example, although the whole interest might extend to 50 acres, if a project was notified in respect of 5 acres, then the deemed disposal of the 50 acres would be taken to have been made but for a market value which relates only to the 5 acres. In other words, the market value on disposal is reduced down to the land actually being developed.<br><br>
It follows that in order to make the DLT assessment on the correct basis, the relevant base values also have to be proportionately reduced in a similar way. At both ends we would reduce the value of the deemed disposal and in relation to the base values. This is achieved by paragraph 18(1) of Schedule 2. The apportionment is made as if the interest in question had consisted only of the land specified in the project of material development.<br><br>
As we have seen, there is a deemed disposal of land and a deemed reacquisition of part of the land. On the deemed reacquisition, following the deemed disposal of part of the owner's interest it is necessary to reverse the reduction process
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 268</span>
so that the relevant base values can be found on the occasion of any subsequent disposal of the interest. This is achieved by paragraph 18(2) of Schedule 2. On the deemed reacquisition, the market value—that is, the market value found on the deemed disposal of the reduced interest—is increased by an appropriate amount. This amount is found by comparing the amount which would have been found on base A on the deemed disposal if the owner's interest had not been reduced—that is, as if sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 18 of Schedule 2 had not applied to apportion acquisition cost, expenditure on improvements, and so on and the amount which was found as base A on the deemed disposal.<br><br>
The difference between these two figures is added to the market value found on the deemed disposal to give the acquisition cost to be attributed to the deemed reacquisition.<br><br>
The amount so found forms the "acquisition cost" to be used when finding the relevant base value on any subsequent disposal. For the purpose of these calculations base A has been used because this will give the balance of acquisition cost and expenditure on relevant improvements, together with the appropriate part of any increase in current use value between the date of the acquisition of the whole of the interest and the date of the deemed disposal. Any expenditure on improvements and any increase in current use value after the date of the deemed reacquisition will be dealt with in accordance with the normal rules. I am sure that that is crystal clear to the Committee and that there will be no more questions arising from this.<br><br>
Perhaps I could summarise it—[<i>Laughter</i>].<br><br>
The main point is that we cannot employ the normal part disposal rules here. The whole of the land is deemed to have been disposed. In the example given, the whole of the 50 acres is deemed to have been disposed, but only for a market value equivalent to the value of the five acres that has been developed. Consequently the taxpayer pays tax only in relation to that part which he is developing. There are technical rules to achieve that effect. I am told that they will achieve that effect with less complication—if that is believable—than if the normal part disposal rules were applied.<br><br>
I hope that this can go on the record and that there will be an opportunity to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0713">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 269</span>
study what I have said. If hon. Gentlemen want to come back to the subject, there will be a better opportunity to refer to it on paragraph 18 of Schedule 2.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to congratulate my hon. Friend the Minister of State for his lucid explanation. I fear that some of my remarks yesterday about my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary might have been taken to imply that I thought that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster-General and my hon. Friend the Minister of State lacked in powers of exposition. Certainly we have had from the Minister of State a very clear exposition. I regret that the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) seems to have left for Kinross—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the Clapham omnibus.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And is therefore unable to undertake a close examination of the matter. I am sure that he would have awarded my hon. Friend a high score.<br><br>
However, there is a matter which I wish to put to my hon. Friend. This is something which we shall come to later, particularly when dealing with Schedule 2. It seems that the exposition that he has given is one of the cases where we should have gained if we had some equations in paragraph 18 of Schedule 2. We could have had scaling up and scaling down at the points of deemed re-acquisition rather more clearly stated. As the Minister has suggested, perhaps we can come back to this matter when we reach Schedule 2. In the meantime I am grateful that he has paved the way for those debates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister of State, not for his explanation of it but for his admirable reading of the first lesson. I cannot say that I congratulate those who wrote the first lesson for him. That brief has made heavy weather of what seems to me to be a simple matter. If there is a large area of land, the whole lot is valued and then apportioned, both as regards the deemed disposal and the deemed re-acquisition. It does not seem difficult to me. I do not say that it is what the paragraph says. I cannot see how it says that at all, but I accept that that is the position.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 270</span>
There are one or two points which I wish to ask. First, why cannot we take the same apportioned amount on the deemed re-acquisition as we take on the deemed disposal? There are two sub-paragraphs to paragraph 18. Sub-paragraph (1) deals with the deemed disposal. I have put "DD" on my notes. Having talked about RI this morning—religious instruction—I have now reached Doctor of Divinity. I think that we are becoming episcopal or even ecumenical in this Committee.<br><br>
Schedule 2(18)(1) deals with deemed disposals and sub-paragraph (2) deals with deemed re-acquisitions. If I understand Clause 2, we seem to go through a different process to arrive at a market value which is taken at the same point of time. The deemed disposal is something which is assumed to occur almost simultaneously, except, I suppose, that when we deem the re-acquisition, we are deeming that the project of material development has started. We are therefore taking that into account as a started project.<br><br>
There will be difficulties over this because there will be arguments between the landowner and the Revenue on the value of the whole of the land on which it is contemplated that development will eventually take place. Then there will be arguments about the apportionment, about how much of the value should be apportioned to that area on which the project is starting. This is why I come to the point of the difference between deemed disposal and deemed re-acquisition.<br><br>
Is the process to be that we are to value the whole of the land—the 100 or so acres—for deemed disposal? When it comes to deemed re-acquisition, we value the whole of the land again, but do we value the land on which development will take place immediately as though the project had started? Or do we deem the whole of the project to have started on the whole of the land, and therefore value the whole as if the project had started in one corner of the land? There will be differences in valuations depending on how that is dealt with. So why can we not at the outset take the piece of land on which development is to take place and value that, instead of this process of going through the valuation of the greater part of the land?<br><br>
I turn now to the wording of Schedule 1(10) to see if it carries out what the Minister of State's brief said it ought to carry out.<br><br>

<li>there is a deemed disposal of a major interest in land, and</li>
<li>the land in which the interest subsists includes both the land comprised in the project of material development in question … and other land,"</li></ol></p></blockquote>
I assume that means that the owner of the land has an interest in a large area, of which the land that is to be developed is merely a part. But it does not actually say that.<br><br>
We have been talking throughout about interest in land as being interest in the land in respect of which a project of material development is starting. We have not been talking about the interests of the owner in some adjoining land, and therefore I am a little puzzled about how we can interpret the land in which the interest subsists—that is the major interest—and "other land". Is it other land immediately adjacent? Is it other land in another town? Or even—if devolution does not occur too rapidly—land in Scotland, Wales or even Northern Ireland? We want to be more precise about that.<br><br>
I think I appreciate the principle of this. I think that very heavy weather has been made of it. I do not feel it is necessary to go through all this process to alter the principle of valuation from the valuation on actual disposal and the valuations on deemed disposals. I should like to have seen the whole of paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 and the whole of paragraph 18 of Schedule 2 taken out. I am sure it would have reduced the complications and the arguments and issues between the developer and those having other interests in the land, and the Revenue.<br><br>
I am very glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) moved this amendment, because it has brought to light an important matter. Far from calming those who have to operate this Bill, it will cause them considerable concern when they read what the Minister of State has read out. I assume that at a later stage we shall have to table further amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is just one question I should like to raise before the debate comes to a conclusion, and which the Minister may be able to answer.<br><br>
I followed every word of his statement to the Committee. I absorbed it fully and understand it entirely, but there is one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 272</span>
question that I think is important. It is: what is the meaning of the word "only" in line 34? I can understand its meaning in line 36, that is quite clear. But why is the word "only" put into line 34 in paragraph 10 which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"it shall be assumed for the purpose only of determining the market value of that interest".</p></blockquote>
In what other circumstances would one wish to make such assumptions and why has the draftsman put in the word "only"?</span></p>
<p>5.45. p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that Conservative Members seem to understand this provision. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said that it was fairly clear to him, though as his speech progressed I noticed a few doubts creeping in as he thought the provision through with his customary clarity of mind.<br><br>
I do not think it is as simple as he indicated. If we were to scrap the paragraphs as suggested by the right hon. Gentleman, I am advised that it would lead to all sorts of difficulties. I can only say to the right hon. Gentleman that it gave me no pleasure to read out those four pages. I wish we could do away with paragraph 10 in Schedule 1 and paragraph 18 in Schedule 2, I am sorry to say that that is not the case. It would create more confusion at the end of the day if we were to do so. The object of putting it on record now was to enable Conservative Members to come back to the matter when we discuss Schedule 2(18) and to enable those developers and builders who are concerned about these things to consider it and come back to us if they have difficulties.<br><br>
My hon Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) suggested that we should have an equation. I have been going through the schedules and I think we lack a few equations in this Bill. Compared to a number of Finance Bills I have known the Bill lacks complicated equations and we shall do our best to find a Senior Wrangler somewhere in the Treasury who can insert a few equations into the schedules.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister of State is thinking of further equations I hope he will carry out what the has done in the Bill. Normally we have had equations in <i>a, b, c</i> or <i>x, y, z.</i> We have at least got them in the initials of what
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0715">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 273</span>
they refer to in this Bill. Further on in the equations one can translate them and not go from <i>a</i>'s to <i>x</i>'s.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is because we have the benefit of those classicists who still remain in the Treasury, even after the Fulton Commission Report.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman said that we value the whole project. In fact, we do not have to value the whole project. What we value is that part of the project on which the material development takes place. In my example I gave the situation of 50 acres where eventually there would be development of the whole, but to start with there was development on five acres. Although a person would be deemed to have disposed of the full 50 acres, it is deemed to have been disposed of at a consideration equal to the value of the five acres. So we are not valuing the 50 acres. We are valuing only the five acres on which the development at that point of time is taking place. The value of the five acres is deemed to be the value of the whole 50 acres. With the re-acquisition the value of that five acres goes into current use value. When there is a further disposal it is not taxed twice but is taken into account in determining future valuations and future tax liabilities. So we do not value the whole 50 acres, but the five acres.<br><br>
The word "only" is inserted to stress that it is only for the purposes of calculating market value not, for example, current use value. Very little would be lost by removing the word "only". The plaintive cry from the draftsman, which we can all appreciate, is that it was only intended to be helpful. The Committee will appreciate that the parliamentary draftsman is a very hard-working and long-suffering individual and wants to help the Committee which is why he has inserted the word "only". I hope the hon. Gentleman will be happy with that explanation, but we can come back to this point when we come to Schedule 2(8).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am reminded a little of the Emperor's clothes. I keep wondering whether at some moment we shall all admit to each other that we do not understand what it is all about—except my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), who tells me <i>sotto voce</i> that he does understand.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 274</span>
The Minister of State has told us that we can come back to this matter under paragraph 18 of Schedule 2, as indeed we must, because I am genuinely uneasy as to whether we are on the right grounds here. The explanation he gave us was lengthy and complicated. Clearly we and other interested parties will want to look at it to see what conclusions, if any, can be drawn from it, before we reach paragraph 18 of Schedule 2.<br><br>
We did not learn the technical reasons why it should be necessary to adopt this procedure instead of following the Clause 3 procedures, which we shall discuss later. Is it possible for the Minister either on our discussions on Clause 3, or in writing, to deal with the objections to using the other part disposal procedures? Why do we have to go through this elaborate rigmarole?<br><br>
With the benefit of the beautifully delivered explanation, as one would expect from the hon. Member for Llanelli (Mr. Davies), even though lacking occasionally in immediate clarity, and with the understanding that we can return to this matter, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the First Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very full discussion on the schedule and I will not delay the Committee for long, but there are still one or two queries remaining on the schedule, and particular paragraphs with which we have not dealt by way of amendments.<br><br>
The first is paragraph 4, which is of considerable importance. We have been assuming in our discussions of amendments the contents of a project of material development and what is intended to be included in material development which is triggered off by the specified operation. Paragraph 4 seems to make it very wide, and again cuts down the possibility for the operator, the developer or the landowner to choose the amount of material development which is to be included in the project he is undertaking.<br><br>
Paragraph 4 states:
<br><blockquote><p>"in determining … what is at any time comprised in a project of material development".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0716">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 275</span>
It then gives the two tests in sub-paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). Sub-paragraph (<i>a</i>) states—I summarise:
<br><blockquote><p>"all the development … shall be taken to be comprised in the project"—</p></blockquote>
that is—
<br><blockquote><p>"all the development … which is to be, or has before that time, been carried out in pursuance of the project, and all operations in the course of the clearing of the land which are to be, or have before that time been, so carried out …"</p></blockquote>
The project, therefore, includes specifically such items as the clearing of land which is not material development. One turns back to the Town and Country Planning Act 1971, and the definition of "development" therein shows that the clearing of the land is not material development. Nevertheless, under paragraph 4, we are to include it as within the project of material development.<br><br>
In other places of the Bill we are told that development which comes within the general development order—that is, exempt from planning permission under a general development order—is not material development. Yet it will be included within the project of material development as we are to interpret it for the purpose of Schedule 1, indeed, for the purposes of this Bill. This seems contrary to the definition of "material development" earlier in the Bill.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary complimented me a little while ago for being able to find my way about the Bill. "Material development" is defined on page 10, in Clause 7(7)ߞ
<br><blockquote><p>"'material development 'means any development other than—"</p></blockquote>
and there it excludes development which comes within a general development order. But for the purpose of Schedule 1(4) we are told to take that into account as part of the project for material development, and this will raise some confusion in the interpretation of the whole of this Schedule, and, indeed, in the interpretation of what is meant by a project of material development in the whole Bill.<br><br>
I think it was Jonathan Swift in "voyage to somewhere or other"—I never remember which voyage—who said something to the effect that someone had spent eight years on a project called "Extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers" and then put it in a bottle and sold it. I wish I could remember which voyage that was. But the projects which we are discussing in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 276</span>
Schedule 1 are hardly projects of extracting sunbeams, even out of cucumbers. We are trying to extract some sort of understanding of what is intended by the Bill. It really is not easy with such contradictory statements as those which appear in relation to material development on pages 10 and 71. That is in paragraph 4(1), but paragraph 4(2) seems entirely unnecessary. It merely says what is already there and I wonder whether the Minister thinks that subparagraph is necessary at all.<br><br>
There is one little word at the bottom of page 71 which I should like the Minister to look at. I do not ask him to give a decision on it immediately, but it refers to statements in a notice in subparagraph (2)(<i>a</i>) and reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"no development which does not fall within the nature and scope of the project as specified in the notice of the variation".</p></blockquote>
It is not really the project that is specified, but the variation. This is merely a small point which might be considered from the drafting point of view.<br><br>
The other important matter here to which I want to call attention is on page 73, paragraph 6(3), which seems to me to be of considerable importance. We have not dealt with it in amendments so far debated. It reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"Where any additional development consists of development on land which was not comprised in the original project, then, to the extent that that development is not specified in a notice given by the Board under sub-paragraph (2) above, it shall be taken for the purposes of this Act to constitute a separate project of material development."</p></blockquote>
I merely question where the burden of proof lies here. I should have preferred to see if the other way round—rather than the assumption that all those which are not mentioned by the Board constitute a separate project of material development, that they should not constitute a separate project of material development unless it is so decided.<br><br>
6 p.m.<br><br>
Again, perhaps I am pleading the case of the chargeable person rather than the case of the Board of Inland Revenue, but it is probably our duty as an Opposition to consider the rights and privileges of the citizen in these circumstances rather than of the Government.<br><br>
Those are the main points which have not come out in the discussions on amendments. We did not deal with Part III of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0717">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 277</span>
the schedule and placed no amendments on the Notice Paper in respect of Part III. But perhaps the Minister would confirm that this is merely a Keeling schedule, and that it repeats the law as it exists. I think it repeats it with some amendments, but perhaps he would give the assurance that, where it differs from the law as it exists at present, there is no substantial difference and they are merely adaptations or drafting amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) says, we have had a fairly lengthy discussion on a number of amendments to this schedule. After the last discussion two points occurred to me. The first was that the definitions are incomplete. I wonder whether, before we come to Clause 46, the Minister would look at the definitions to see whether they could be expanded to pick up some of the points that we have come across in our more detailed discussions and to deal with some of the problems of the Scots equivalent, if I may use that phrase without being pounced upon by my hon. Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) and the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford). If an incumbrance carries a different meaning in Scotland, or no meaning, we can at least see it set out clearly at that point.<br><br>
Secondly, the problem of timing arises from Part I of the Schedule. I am reminded of what the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said to the Government some time ago in a memorandum of observations upon this Bill, dated 5th November 1975. The Institution may have had it in mind that it could be confined to some explosive situation to the benefit of us all. However, it pointed out at the time, and that gave the Government time to pay attention to it, that the whole problem of taxing unrealised gains is in conflict with what was said in the White Paper "Land". The Institution said that the development land tax would generally be payable:
<br><blockquote><p>"When development value is realised on disposal of land … but any development value realised by the carrying out of development will also be liable to tax."</p></blockquote>
We have run into all these problems consequent upon the Government's erroneous decision to introduce this tax at the commencement of a project of material
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 278</span>
development instead of doing the logical thing, which is to levy the tax at the time of realisation of value from development, whether by means of sale or by the granting of a lease.<br><br>
Perhaps it is not too late for the Government, faced with the problem of having to get up every now and again to explain the complications we are running into, to have second thoughts on this issue.<br><br>
I should like to draw attention to paragraph 11. Perhaps I should not draw attention to it, because there is a problem which might work to the advantage of a developer. I am sure the Government would not wish anything so untoward to occur. What happens, in the light of the wording in paragraph 11, if a developer starts a project of material development without planning permission? That is by no means an unknown situation and, on occasions, a planning authority has been quite happy to turn a blind eye to such an event because it is discussing something and it has let it be known that it is quite happy for the developer to start a project in which it might even have an interest. The authority is happy for the developer to get on while it settles the last few details.<br><br>
It seems to me that under paragraph 11 we might run into a situation where the re-acquisition and the current use value takes place with the assumption that there is no planning permission. I may be wrong, but it is a potential problem.<br><br>
On Part III—which, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby pointed out, we have not discussed—I turned to the guidance notes. This part of the guidance notes is very interesting because, knowing the Treasury's natural economical approach to the use of the printed page, I found a surprisingly blank page. All it says on page 42 is;
<br><blockquote><p>"For ease of reference the existing rules in Section 84, Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, have been reproduced with the necessary adaptations".</p></blockquote>
One was almost left with the uneasy feeling that other people's editions would include a list and an explanation of the adaptation, because room appeared to have been left for them' I echo what my right hon. Friend said. Perhaps we could have some explanation of what those adaptations are and the reason for them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have two small points relating to paragraph 6 on page 73. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0718">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 279</span>
yellow book is something less than helpful on the subject of paragraph 6(2). It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"if it appears to the Board that the whole or any part of the additional development constitutes a separate project, it will be treated as such."</p></blockquote>
That is a fairly laconic description of the contents of sub-paragraph (2). I am particularly interested in the wording of sub-paragraph 2 (<i>b</i>):
<br><blockquote><p>"it appears to the Board that the whole or any part of the additional development constitutes a separate project of material development, having regard to all relevant matters, including in particular the nature and scope of the original project".</p></blockquote>
After the qualifications after the word "matters", my immediate marginal note was—"What else could there be?". What other relevant matters could there be than:
<br><blockquote><p>"the nature and scope of the original project"</p></blockquote>
bearing in mind that this is a question of additional development from the original project? "The scope and nature of the original project" seem to be the whole question. When we read "all relevant matters", we assume, for example, that there are no personal circumstances involved and that we are interested only in objective criteria of the new development.<br><br>
Perhaps the Minister of State could confirm what the draftsmen have in mind in putting "all relevant matters".<br><br>
Before the beginning of sub-paragraph (<i>c</i>) at line 16, I would have preferred to see inserted—we did not put down an amendment, but we may do so later—something like "having so established that the additional development constitues a separate project". In sub-paragraphs (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) the question of "It appears to the Board" is vital. I think that these objective matters should not solely be matters for the Board to decide without showing that it has established this. This should have been written into the legislation.<br><br>
We had discussion about the onus of proof. Assurances were given on the subject of appeals at the time of assessment and that was desirable, but it needs to be said that the matters in paragraph 6(2)(<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) are important and should be treated on the basis of objective examination and not solely by the subjective view of the Board.<br><br>
Turning briefly to Part III which, as my hon. Friend said, we have not discussed at all, I think that the system of reproducing existing law in a schedule is generally a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 280</span>
good one. It is to be preferred to referring to existing Acts, or, in some cases, to what I can only call the mixed system of partly referring to existing Acts. For example, to say "Sub-paragraph 54(<i>c</i>) of Section 29 of the Finance Act 1974 should be amended by substituting 'if' for 'but'" is worse than making no reference to it at all. This is to be preferred and should be continued.<br><br>
However, it would have been helpful to the Committee if the necessary adaptations had been reproduced in the yellow. book. Clearly the Committee would always take consolidation without comment, but we need assurances that the alterations made are of no basic substance and are merely drafted to take account of the Act. In any case, it would have been desirable to have had them listed in the yellow book.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A number of points have been raised, and I shall try to deal with them. The first point raised by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) was in relation to paragraph 4(1)(<i>a</i>). He said that we are including in a project of material development something that is not strictly material development, such as operations relating to clearing the site.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman is quite right. Those are not material developments in the normal sense of the word. However, they are included in a project of material development to enable the developer to have them included in the current use value of the land and any costs incurred upon those operations, because clearing the land would obviously entail expense. That expense could then be brought into the tax computation arising on the commencement of the project of material development.<br><br>
That is obviously desirable and right, and it is why such operations are included as part of the project, to benefit the developer so that he can claim the cost of these operations included when the tax computation is made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister of State confirm that demolition is included in the clearing of land in this context?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether demolition is included in the clearing of land, but I am seem to remember that demolition is not included in material development. There seems to have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0719">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 281</span>
something in the betterment levy to that effect and I believe the position is the same here. In fact, the carrying out of demolition is not deemed to be the commencement of a project of material devleopment, or so I understand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Demolition is clearly the clearing of the land, and I should have thought that there would be no question about it if it is included in the phrase used in paragraph 4(1)(<i>a</i>), and I am sure the Minister is about to receive that advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Demolition is not usually included in the list of specified operations because it is not usually a specified operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I did not make myself clear. It is certainly not a specified operation and it is not material development, but it is surely clearing of the land and, therefore, comes within this paragraph.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the right hon. Gentleman says. Demolition would, in most cases, be part of clearing the land. I thought that the right hon. Gentleman was referring to the other point about whether demolition was a specified operation. It is not, but demolition takes place in the course of clearing the land and obviously it is part of that operation.<br><br>
May I also deal with paragraph 6(3), to which the right hon. Gentleman raised some objection. He said that there was no provision for appeal, or at least the onus was on the taxpayer. I am told that subparagraph (3) in fact ensures that, in any case where additional development is carried out on land that was not comprised in the original project, it will always have to be regarded as constituting a separate project. In other words, if additional development takes place on other land that was not comprised in the original project then—I think this is reasonable—it shall be treated as the commencement of a separate project, because it has been carried out on other land that was not comprised in the original notice of development. Again, it would be only right in those circumstances that the onus be on the taxpayer, not on the Board, because the taxpayer has chosen to operate in that way.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 282</span>
We had some discussion on Part III. Hon. Members are quite right, and I can give the assurance that Part III sets out what is still in Section 84 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 with regard to duration and length of leases and how leases should be treated for the purposes of the tax code. Originally, the intention was merely to mention Section 84 and leave it at that, but we had representations from various professional bodies which preferred it to be set out in this way, so as a result of those representations we have in effect set out the provisions of Section 84 and incorporated them into this legislation, because many of the professional bodies suggested that it would be easier this way, and he accepted that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), referred to the blank page 42 of the Explanatory Notes. I can only suggest that it may have been left blank to enable the equations that my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) mentioned to be inserted.<br><br>
One hon. Gentleman referred to paragraph 6(2)(<i>b</i>) on page 73 of the Bill and the phrase "all relevant matters" and wanted to know what the relevant matters were. I shall not tell him what they might be, because the Parliamentary draftsman, in his wisdom, knows and appreciates that circumstances change and it is a bit much to ask him to think up every situation that may occur in the future. If these matters come to be decided upon, it is for the Commissioners, and in the end the courts, to decide what are relevant matters within the context of legislation. We cannot expect every possible item to be set out in legislation. If we were to do that, the hon. Gentleman would complain that the legislation was even longer and more complicated than it is at the moment.<br><br>
6.15 p.m.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) then referred to the wording of paragraph 6(2)(<i>b</i>) "it appears to the Board". He suggested that he would like other wording. We had quite a long debate on the question of appeal at this stage, and I gave the Committee an assurance that we would look at the matter again and that we would find a way to provide some form of appeal.<br><br>
I preferred—at least initially—an appeal as part of the assessment appeal before the Commissioners, not a pre-trial stage
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0720">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 283</span>
appeal, if I may call it that, but rather an appeal in the normal course of assessment. The right hon. Gentleman would have preferred an initial appeal to the Commissioners and we are looking at that matter to see whether we can meet the points that were raised. We shall incorporate some form of appeal, in view of what hon. Gentlemen have said.<br><br>
I think I have dealt with most of the points that have been raised on this Schedule stand part debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the hon. Gentleman about my query on paragraph 11.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can set the hon. Gentleman's mind at rest regarding paragraph 11, because on the re-acquisition, it would be deemed that the re-acquisition was lawful and that planning permission had been granted. Indeed, all the assumptions in paragraph 8(1) in relation to the fact that the project was lawful, means that planning permission would have been granted. These assumptions still apply in the same way to the re-acquisition, so he need not be concerned. The Revenue is perfectly well protected in this case, but we are grateful to him for his concern.</span></p>

if it is deleted in (<i>a</i>) so that it should not apply to (<i>a</i>), we have to say something about (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), which brings me to a point of some embarrassment. I see that my name is attached to Amendment No. 50 as it is to Amendment No. 49.<br><br>
In studying this matter in greater detail, I am wondering whether we have the amendment right and perhaps we should have said "shall not apply to (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>)" instead of bringing back the applications (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>), because (<i>b</i>) is the restrictive covenants again, which we were discussing in another context.<br><br>
I think it is worth while considering whether we are right in having the payments received for releasing a restrictive covenant in the simple English words of the oak-coloured book and whether it is right that they should constitute a matter for tax under development land tax.<br><br>
There are many states of restrictive covenant, the most familiar of which is a restriction against any sort of development. There are restrictions against scale of development, against the use of land other than for a single private residence, and so on. The reason for these covenants is clearly that somebody sees that the value of his interest in another piece of land would be diminished or, at least, the value attached to that land would be diminished, were that covenant to be breached. Therefore, if they receive a payment for releasing that restrictive covenant, they are not necessarily better off. They may even be worse off in the sense that the value of their interest which led them to put the covenant on in the first place is being diminished by there being development, a tall building or a factory opposite.<br><br>
In the same way, we have the restrictions on use. To mention a personal experience, I recall that a neighbour and myself with much abused second homes in the country bought a field in which we thought we might put ponies for our children. Obviously, we were each slightly doubtful about the motives of the other party. Each of us imposed a restrictive covenant on the other against using the field for any purpose other than grazing horses and cattle. I think that we each had in mind that the other might start up a pig or a poultry farm which, in a small way, would naturally have diminished the value and enjoyment of that interest. That is an example of why people put restrictions on use and why they think they would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0721">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 285</span>
entitled to a payment for the release of that restriction.<br><br>
On a bigger scale, there is the trading restriction, where one could have a substantial diminution in the value of an interest in land.<br><br>
Let us suppose—the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) has I believe associations with the Co-operative Movement—that the Co-operative Movement had imposed a restriction on there being any other supermarket on that land, and that another efficient trader was seeking to build a supermarket. In such an event, the Co-operative Movement might well seek a substantial payment for releasing that restrictive covenant, I am not at all clear why such a payment should give rise to the possibility of development land tax.<br><br>
The substantial part is really (<i>a</i>). The amendment seeks to ensure that the
<br><blockquote><p>"sums received by way of compensation for any kind of damage to land in which that interest subsists or for any depreciation or risk of depreciation of that interest"</p></blockquote>
shall not be taken into account in a part disposal. In fact, it will not be held to become a part disposal and liable to assessment for development land tax.<br><br>
The reason for the amendment was put clearly by the Housebuilders' Federation, which said:
<br><blockquote><p>"It is inequitable that a compensation payment, i.e. a payment which restores a <i>status quo,</i> should be liable to tax."</p></blockquote>
This is the essence of the argument in support of the amendment—in the same way as I explained that one is paid to release a restrictive covenant because it has value. Thus, if one releases a restrictive covenant, one is left with less value in the amount of land one held before, whether it be a commercial example of a trader who releases a restrictive covenant and allows in competition, or whether it be an individual who releases a restrictive covenant and allows development nearby, thereby reducing the value of his property.<br><br>
What we are looking at, in a sense, here is the relationship of the money paid for the injurious affection to the remaining value of the interest in land. I find it surprising that the Bill, as worded, specifically provides that the subsection applies
<br><blockquote><p>"in particular to … sums received by way of compensation".</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 286</span>
Surely the very word "compensation" implies support for my argument. If one has, as the booklet instances, an ancient light, one has something which is of benefit to one's property—the right to light and air. If that right to light and air is diminished, or altogether extinguished by some other development it would be abundantly clear that one's property has suffered a diminution in value. If a payment was received in compensation it should not be regarded as something giving rise to the equivalent of a part disposal and the possibility of development land tax.<br><br>
The examples quoted in the Explanatory Notes are:
<br><blockquote><p>"compensation paid for injurious affection of land, for infringement of ancient lights, for damage to the land or for revocation of a planning permission".</p></blockquote>
That seems even stranger. Could we not have a situation where somebody has an entirely valid, detailed, complete planning permission—that rare thing where even the colour of the paint on the front door has been agreed. It has all been settled before the present Government came into power. For good, bad or indifferent reasons, the local authority decides to revoke that planning permission. Then, under existing law—and there is no suggestion that that law should be changed—the holder of that planning permission is entitled to an appropriate sum by way of compensation.<br><br>
I see no reason why payment in respect of the revocation of a planning permission, which the landowner was entitled to use without incurring liability to development land tax, should make him liable to that tax. One could foresee a position where local authorities would rush around revoking every planning permission which had not been acted upon so that they might accrue money for the Revenue by making that payment liable to development land tax. I should be delighted if the Minister of State will totally re-arrange the situation. But if one has a planning permission, to which one is entitled because the local planning authority gave it, and it is revoked, one would be entitled to compensation. One would have lost something of value. Why should one have to pay development land tax on the compensation payment?<br><br>
We have an amendment which seeks to ensure that any payment for injurious affection shall not count as a part disposal.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0722">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 287</span>
I suspect that the Minister of State may call in aid ingenious schemes of avoidance, which might be used to get around the provisions for this tax, as an explanation. If that is so and there is a genuine scheme of avoidance which needs to be tackled, there should be a way of tackling it which does not involve payment of genuine compensation for loss of something of value being treated as a part disposal.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury). The Minister may well pray in aid the issue of tax avoidance, but he is more likely to pray in aid the betterment levy. He shakes his head. I beg his pardon. Perhaps I have given him new ideas.<br><br>
I can well remember that when the betterment levy was proceeding through Parliament Cases D and E covered both these circumstances—the wayleaves, and so on. My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) was involved in the Committee stage of the Land Commission Bill and great fun was had about the amount of betterment levy which was likely to accrue to somebody who had a telegraph pole placed on his land and the amount of assessment that would have to be done, the serving of notices through Newcastle, and so on. There are precedents for taxation on this type of activity, although the amount of revenue from them I suspect is negligible. I would be interested to know what, if any, revenue there was from betterment levy in Cases D and E when it was on the statute book.<br><br>
6.30 p.m.<br><br>
I am sure my hon. Friend was right to put his finger on the question of revocation, because here is a case where the community has changed its mind. It is perfectly arguable that the community should take a slice of the gain it has created by virtue of giving planning permission. I would go back further and say that the planning system itself in many ways is the cause of all our problems, but that is by the way. We have a planning system. It creates betterment. Therefore the argument is whether the betterment should be taxed. So there is betterment. The planning permission has been granted by the benevolent community. The community now decides,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 288</span>
for some reason or other, that it has changed its mind and will take the betterment away again. It does two things. It not only takes away the prospect of carrying out the development, but it takes away 80 per cent. of the very reasonable compensation that it had to pay for changing its mind. That seems to me to be a wholly inequitable procedure.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hove talked about local authorities going around revoking planning permission. I think he said that with his tongue in his cheek. I should like to know what happens in the circumstances where a local authority revokes planning permission, perhaps because it is dissatisfied with the form of planning permission which, say, its political predecessor had granted, and then uses its powers under the Community Land Act to acquire the land at what would, by definition, be existing use value since the revocation of planning permission had taken place. In those circumstances will the taxpayer have to pay the compensation for revocation or would the local authority buy the land net of revocation tax? I think it would be useful to have that matter cleared up. Does the Minister catch the point I am trying to make?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes. I have been catching it for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman.<br><br>
My next question is how sums received for the granting of a wayleave will be assessed for the purposes of tax. How many disposals of this kind have there been, say, in the past 12 months, perhaps even notified to the Stamp Office? What revenue is expected from this procedure and how much administration is it likely to cause? I think that the Committee ought to know this if we are to let this pass into law.<br><br>
On the question of injurious affection, again this is a matter for community action. The law relating to injurious affection is pretty limited and tight. It is not possible, I understand, to get any injurious affection of land if the land itself—or part of it—has not been taken. I seem to recall from the days when I studied Corfield on Compensation that there have been many cases when because say, a railway line went through the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0723">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 289</span>
bottom of a person's garden and made his life a misery, he could get a reduction on the rates, but was not entitled to any injurious affection compensation. In this case, therefore, land must always have been taken. The landowner is by definition worse off and he is then to pay 80 per cent. taxation on the small amount of compensation which he gets for having his land taken. I think that sort of thing is not likely to go down very well with the ordinary person who is having his land acquired by compulsory purchase. The Minister of State may have a full and substantial argument to make and perhaps a reassuring one. If not I hope that my hon. Friend will choose not to withdraw his amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The actual wording of the subsection to which the amendment applies says that if an owner of an interest in land receives a sum by way of compensation for any kind of damage to the land it should be treated as a part disposal and, therefore, tax has to be paid on the development value. Heaven knows how one calculates the development value of a payment of compensation. There are a number of cases given in these helpful Explanatory Notes. The first is compensation paid for injurious affection of land. That, of course, is a very restricted case. Injurious affection, as properly interpreted, merely means what my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has said—that if some of a person's land is taken away from him and the remainder is affected badly by that, with the value being reduced, the person receives compensation for injurious affection.<br><br>
The paragraph is not restricted to that type of rather narrow compensation provision. It refers to compensation for any kind of damage to land. Suppose that a motorway is built near to some land. The owner is entitled to compensation, one way and another, for the nuisance caused, first in the construction of that motorway, and secondly by the use of it for many years to come. He may be compensated by payment or by way of double glazing. Is it really being suggested that the Government, having deprived a person of amenities of that sort, and having paid compensation for so depriving him, should then take back a large chunk of that by way of tax?<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 290</span>
It is really not disposal of any right as one would understand it. We can understand the tax falling on the proceeds of disposal of a main interest in land, but is injurious affection so disposed when compensation is paid? Are ancient lights so disposed when they are infringed? When there is damage to land and compensation is paid, is there something so disposed? Using the phrase "so disposed" I am reminded that Mrs. Gamp said in "Martin Chuzzlewit", "Put the bottle on the chimney-piece and I'll put my lips to it it when I'm so disposed." I do not think that phraseology, "so disposed", is intended in this particular clause, but it really is taking this tax to extremes when it is applied in this way. I ask the Government to consider it again.<br><br>
Even if there are occasions when a little bit of tax might be taken on one particular transaction, it would not really destroy the purpose of imposing this tax if we were to relieve the owner on those occasions.<br><br>
All that is included in this clause does not, surely, come within the basis of this tax. We are told that this tax is imposed because someone is obtaining a benefit from what the community has done. In this case, is the person concerned obtaining a benefit from the fact that the motorway is put there, and the amenities to his property are destroyed? All that is happening there is that he is being restored partially, by payment, to the previous condition of his property. If we have to go through these assessments every time that happens, it defeats the whole purpose of the Land Compensation Act, which the Labour Members joined with us in passing during the last Conservative Government. I believe that we must exclude many of these cases of compensation for damage to land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Opposition have disappointed us with this amendment. Until now, they have shown themselves to be a responsible, even statesmanlike, Opposition, in their attitude towards their amendments. But it is getting late in the week, being Thursday evening, and we have had a number of speeches which might be called tongue-in-cheek speeches. I suspect that in the right hon. Gentleman's case, perhaps part of his was in that category.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the Land Compensation Act and said that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0724">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 291</span>
we were undoing all the good work of that Act. I am not necessarily talking now about development value. Since 1965 payments made under the Land Compensation Act have always been liable to Capital Gains Tax at 30 per cent. A person may receive a sum of money as compensation for his land, and here the nuisance example is a good one.<br><br>
If a motorway is built next to my property and I receive damage for nuisance, that damage or compensation to my property has been treated since 1965 as a deemed disposal. Tax of 30 per cent. would have been paid on it. The wording in the Bill more or less follows the wording for capital gains. I am not making a major point of this. My point is that compensation has always been accepted.<br><br>
With income tax, if a person's stock in trade is destroyed and he receives compensation in respect of that stock in trade, he will pay income tax or corporation tax. Hon. Gentlemen cannot suggest that these payments should be tax-free because they come as compensation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that compensation received for injurious affection to one's principal private residence is subject to capital gains tax, although any gain made from selling one's principal private residence is not? Surely that is not the situation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is "No", as the hon. Gentleman will know.<br><br>
May I come back to the main point on compensation? If I have a piece of land with planning permission and if I can sell that land for £100,000, even the Opposition would agree that I have to pay some betterment tax on the betterment of development value. It may be 60 per cent., 52 per cent. or 30 per cent. in their case. At least hon. Gentlemen have conceded that point. So if I receive £100,000 from selling the land, I pay a tax—we say 66⅔ per cent. and 80 per cent., subject to the first £10,000—I cannot see the difference in principle. If I receive £100,000 in respect of that land because the local authority decides to revoke my planning permission, I shall have lost my planning permission but I have £100,000. Why should I not pay tax in such a situation? If I pay tax in the other situation of selling the land, I have still made £100,000 from what I have. Why
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 292</span>
should it be different in the case of selling to receiving a sum in compensation for losing a right? Albeit the compensation was perhaps involuntary in that I did not want the local authority to take away this right from me—there is a difference there—but I am still £100,000 better off in both cases. That £100,000 arises initially as a result of the act of the community in granting planning permission. It is on that £100,000, if it is development or betterment value, that we propose that tax should apply in the same way as if I sold my property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are discussing a development land tax. By definition, in the circumstances which the Minister describes, no development could possibly take place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will know that there will be many cases where somebody may sell land with planning permission but may not carry out any development. He will still pay the tax. Is the hon. Gentleman now suggesting that someone who has planning permission on land, who does not develop it himself but sells it without developing it, who is making £100,000 or more from that sale should not pay the tax because he has not done any development? If that is what the hon. Gentleman means, he has not understood the Bill.<br><br>
The Bill makes it clear that if I dispose of land in any way, and as a result of that disposal I receive money in respect of the development value, I pay a development land tax on that money.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The essential point that the Minister overlooks is that if the person's planning permission is taken away, the fact remains that had he sold that land, its current use value would have reflected the use approved by that planning permission.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that planning permission is revoked and the man receives £100,000 in respect of the development value, that is something in his pocket. It is money that is in his pocket because of the development value, and for no other reason. The £100,000 is not paid for any other reason. It is paid because the land had development value and planning permission and so he pays his tax accordingly. In the same way, if a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0725">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 293</span>
man sells the land and receives £100,000 because of the planning permission and the development value, he pays tax on that £100,000.<br><br>
That is what we are concerned about in the sub-paragraph. If sums are received in compensation for damage to land—it may not be revocation of planning permission, it may be damage to land in any other way—the tax arises only if that damage damages the development value and as a result compensation is paid for the damage to the development value. If the damage relates to the current use value—the right hon. Gentleman mentioned the case of the nuisance of the motorway—I would have thought that that was probably damage to current use value and that the damage payments did not reflect any development value. In that case legislation would not apply.<br><br>
Hon. Gentlemen mentioned small amounts of compensation. Again, if they follow this Bill they will know that the first £10,000 of these small amounts of compensation will be completely tax free. So we are not talking about small amounts of compensation. We are talking about amounts of compensation in excess of £10,000—£10,000 and more reflected in development value. I really do not see why the Opposition should complain about this particular sub-paragraph. We are only saying that if somebody receives money for development, value, albeit in terms of compensation and not through any other sale or disposal, then we follow the normal rules of the tax code. A trader gets compensation for stock in trade. He pays income tax and corporation tax. A person gets compensation in respect of a capital asset. He pays capital gains tax. A person gets compensation in respect of damage to development value of a development asset. He pays development gains tax. I would have thought that is a perfectly logical principle, and that is all we are trying to apply in this particular sub-paragraph.</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I listened carefully to the argument because my hon. Friends were opening their case. I was uncertain as to the main arguments on this amendment. Although I think there may be justice in what the Minister of State says,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 294</span>
that there is a logical case for extending this tax to payments which arise out of non-development or some form of change of use, it is a major extension of the original concept of the legislation as first put forward. The idea that we had all understood was that where a change of use took place and where development took place, then it was thought that it would be right for the State to take a proportion of those profits. This is put forward as some form of anti-avoidance measure. It is no such thing. It is a major extension of the ambit of the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misunderstood the legislation, because legislation merely reflects the proposition that if a person makes a profit out of development value and that development value arises initially because of planning permission as a result of what the community does, that profit should be taxed as a development profit, or a betterment profit, if he prefers that word. That is all we are doing. We are taxing a betterment profit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It may well be that I have not looked at this legislation as carefully as I ought to have done, and it may be that I am sadly remiss in not having spent all my waking hours looking at the various subsections of this enormously long Bill. But I have had the misery of listening to most of the major debates upon this area of Government policy over the past two years, and all I can say is that I may be so stupid that I cannot understand the details of the thing, but I do not believe I am so stupid that I cannot understand the general drift of what was being said. And the general drift was that we were to have a tax upon development gains and not an additional tax upon non-development and compensation. It is no good the Minister saying "Oh, this is just an anti-avoidance subsection." This is a major extension of the philosophy. He may be justified in logic in extending the philosophy, but it is not good enough to try and slap us down on the basis that we do not understand the details.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I never said that this was an anti-avoidance measure. It was the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends who said that. They seem to be as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0726">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 295</span>
obsessed with avoidance as, possibly, the Inland Revenue is from time to time. I never said that. It is nothing to do with avoidance. It is compensation genuinely paid for the loss of development value.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must say I was somewhat disappointed in the Minister of State's reply, particularly as I did ask him a specific question. I thought he was not listening at that stage. But he said that he had been listening although he was talking to the right hon. Gentleman. I do not mind that. It is very pleasant to talk to the right hon. Gentleman. Perhaps that was more pleasant than to listen to me. But I did ask him a specific question, which he said he had seized, but to which he did not reply. Perhaps I can put it again. As the hours go by, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be able to help the Committee.<br><br>
I described a particular situation which could very easily happen. An individual has received planning permission for a piece of land from a previous local council, there has been change in the political control of the local council, a new one comes in, decides to have a revocation order which is duly confirmed, planning permission is duly revoked, and the local authority then uses its powers immediately under the Community Land Act to acquire the land for itself because it wants to put council housing there or some other form of development. In those circumstances, would the compensation for revocation, taxable at 80 per cent. or 66⅔ per cent. depending on its value, be deducted by the local authority as a net of payment basis, or would it be paid to the Revenue direct? Would the local authority get the double benefit of its enterprise—two-thirds or 80 per cent. of the value of the property prior to revocation and the property itself—or would it simply get the property? I hope that the Minister of State can reply to that later.<br><br>
I turn now to the general principle. It seems to me absolutely clear that the basis of this is the development land tax. That is why I interrupted the Minister of State. He said "The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that many times a landowner does not develop land himself. Of course not. He sells it to a builder, he makes his big profit. Is the hon. Gentleman really saying" the Minister asked me "that in such circumstances no tax should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 296</span>
be paid, because in that case he has not understood the Bill?"<br><br>
Of course I did not mean that. I was pointing out that in the case where the land is sold to the builder, development is going to take place. It may not be going to take place by the landowner, it may be going to take place by the developer, but the land has been sold with planning permission to the developer who then develops. So development has taken place, there has been betterment, there has been a gain, it is taxed.<br><br>
In this case of revocation, by definition there is not going to be any development at all. The State has changed its mind. It is taking the land with revocation for the specific purpose of avoiding development or, if not avoiding development, at least avoiding development by that man on that site under that planning permission, because it has revoked it. "Ah", says the Minister, "but he has made a gain. It must be taxed." It is very interesting that the two sentences come together. He has made a gain, therefore it must be taxed. That is a stance which many of us would not necessarily agree with, but it is the Minister's view nevertheless. He has made a gain, therefore it must be taxed—and taxed at 80 per cent. or 66⅔ per cent., as the case may be.<br><br>
There seems to me to be a very real distinction between the compensation payable to somebody for having lost his asset and the gain which he may have made from realising the asset in its full market form. If the hon. Gentleman cannot see any distinction, in either logic or practice, I can only say that I can, and we may have to agree to differ.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman then asked why the Opposition were wasting time with their wayleaves, gains of £5, and so on, as obviously there would be no tax on that, it is all under £10,000, and it would be quite ridiculous even to talk about it. But—and I hope I am not wrong; I have done my best to read the Bill—I think there is still a notification duty even though no tax may, in fact, be assessable. If there is to be a notification duty of some sort, that means more administration and more bureaucracy for the purpose of ensuring that no tax is payable.<br><br>
Let us take, for example, the National Farmers' Union, which I understand has an agreement with the Central Electricity Generating Board that if it wishes to put a series of pylons across a farmer's land
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0727">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 297</span>
there is a tariff of about £5 payable to the farmer for this particular easement. I am well aware that, under this Bill, that £5 is not development value and will not be taxed, but is it to be notified? If so, who is to be responsible for filing all the paperwork and deciding that no tax is to be paid?<br><br>
These were exactly the sort of questions which, before the Minister or I came anywhere near the House of Commons—indeed, I think it was before the right hon. Gentleman came to the House—concerned hon. Members in the Committee stage of the Land Commission Bill back in 1966.<br><br>
We never received any satisfactory answer then. All the assessments went to Newcastle. Now I suppose that they will go to the Revenue, perhaps even to Middlesbrough. That is what concerns us. It is not a question of worrying about whether someone has to pay tax on £5. We are aware that he will not pay tax on £5. But we do not see the need to have all this garbage in the Bill when no sort of tax will actually be payable. We are trying to help the Government, because, if they had not bothered with all that, they would not be having this debate, the Minister of State would not have to reply to it, he would not have to sit here listening to us, and we could all go home and have dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that the intention was to reflect—I think that is the word he used—the relevant value. It seems to me, and I am sure my right hon. and hon. Friends agree, that payment of compensation for injurious affection or for the loss of ancient lights in no way reflects development value.<br><br>
I am not clear what provision in this clause, or in any of the other numerous clauses to which we frequently find that we have to refer, makes this plain. If the Minister says that he is disappointed in us, he will probably be disappointed in the Housebuilders Federation and others who seem to have read the clause in exactly the same way. It was certainly the view of builders that the effect of the clause would be to make payments for injurious affection or compensation for loss of such items as ancient lights, which are nothing to do with development, become liable for development land tax. If the Minister can reassure us that that is not so, we
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 298</span>
should take a different view. At the moment I am in the position of being disappointed in the Minister of State's reply. He gave us no such reassurance and did not demonstrate to me, nor to my right hon. and hon. Friends, how this provision applied.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roper</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was concerned by part of the argument developed by my hon. Friend the Minister, but in respect of the revocation of planning permission I am convinced that in logic it should attract development land tax. I am, however, curious to know whether in those situations we shall in future have local authorities paying somewhat larger sums in compensation for planning permission, because they will take into account the tax which will be payable upon that permission by the individual concerned. Therefore, the net effect on the public purse may be zero.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If that was happening, namely, that the local authority was revoking a planning permission by payment of a sum of money, it would surely have to abide by the district valuer's valuation of that sum. I suggest that it would be grossly improper to pay any larger amount.<br><br>
The Minister said that the receipt of compensation has been recognised for tax purposes in legislation already. I seek the hon. Gentleman's guidance on this matter. My recollection is that a provision of this sort does not apply to development gains tax, although it applies to capital gains tax. I recall Section 22(3) of the Finance Act 1965, where it is applied to capital gains tax. Capital gains tax applies to current use value. Speaking roughly, capital gains tax is imposed on an increase in current use value, namely, on inflation. Capital gains tax is actually a tax on inflation. It merely applies to an increase in the current use value.<br><br>
I believe that the Minister said, when we were talking about compensation in answer to my question about compensation under the Land Compensation Act, that it was a question of the current use value of the land. If that is so, and if I am right in thinking that this provision applied only to capital gains tax and not to development gains tax, it strengthens the argument which the Opposition have put forward. If the Minister says that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0728">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 299</span>
the provision does apply to development gains tax, all I can say is that it ought not to. I probably argued that it ought not to when the present Government were putting into operation a draft Bill which they picked up off the desk of the previous Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, without our party knowing anything about the contents of that Bill. So I refuse to be bound—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that he was not bound by the eternal principle, collective responsibility?</span></p>
<p>7.00 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There was no question of collective responsibility on the details of a Bill. Indeed, the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer made a statement in December 1973 on the principle of taxation of development gains. I am bound by that statement of general principle of the taxation of those gains. The Department had prepared a Bill, in the same way that the Department prepared a draft of this Bill back in October and it was put in the White Paper. If the right hon. Gentleman holds me to the draft Bill that was put on the desk of the man who is now Lord Barber, I will hold him to every term of the Bill that was in the White Paper last August, and not to this one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a simple question. The right hon. Gentleman knows that the White Paper was published for the purposes of consultation. We had consultations
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 300</span>
and, as a result, improved the Bill and published it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is exactly the same principle as the Bill which was drafted by the parliamentary draftsmen for Lord Barber in those days. He made the point again and again, when the Bill was going through in 1974, that we were not bound by the details of that Bill.<br><br>
I am speaking hypothetically at present, because I am still waiting for the Minister of State to give me guidance and tell me whether, although I have waded through the 1974 Act, it comes within the development gains tax provisions. I have always recognised this as being compensation for damage to land and compensation which is a question of capital gains because it affects the current use value but not the development value of the land. If we must apply the development value all the way through, and especially under the provisions of the Bill, as drafted, it will be most unfair.<br><br>
There may be a case for other examples given in the Explanatory Notes as included under sub-paragraph (<i>a</i>). It may be possible, as the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) mentioned, that there will be an argument over revocation. But there can be no justification for bringing compensation for damage to the land into these provisions. I hope that the Minister will think again about this.</span></p>
