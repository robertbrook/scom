	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>J</i>) a builder or developer of residential or industrial property (as defined in the Community Land (Excepted Development) Regulations 1976) on the occasion of any development value being realised, or being deemed to be realised, on the commencement of a project of material development that is to say, a deemed disposal'.—[	<i>Mr. Michael Latham.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was on my feet when we adjourned, but having looked at my notes and reminded myself of the brilliant way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) put the case and the very poor and unconvincing reply that he received, I do not think that I need detain the Committee any longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two ways of looking at this. It may be that the right hon. Gentleman reflected on the merits of the amendment and came to that conclusion, but I certainly would not wish to provoke the right hon. Gentleman—I have much too much respect for him to do that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is quite wrong of the Minister to give me that lead in. He is encouraging me to start a long speech about it all over again. I thought that I was being kind to the Committee. If I can cut my speeches short, I am only too happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Secretary's speech satisfactory. Obviously, it was very disappointing to me. But we have debated the matter already at some length and we shall be debating it again if we catch your eye, Mr. Crawshaw, when we reach Amendment No. 309. In the circumstances, therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave the clause, I should like to put a few remarks on the record. I am very glad to see that there is included among those bodies which are totally exempt from development land tax one which does not perhaps fit exactly into the pattern of the others and which is not a local authority in the absolute sense of the word. I refer to the Letchworth Garden City Corporation. I rise to speak on this occasion, if I may so put it, as the hon. Member not for Hitching but for Letchworth. I should like to say how pleased I am that for the purposes of this legislation, as for many other statutory purposes, the Letchworth Garden City Corporation has been included along with local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the White Paper was published, the Garden City Corporation was not included among the bodies to be exempt. However, representations were made to the Government by representatives of the corporation last November, and these resulted in its inclusion. As I expect that similar representations may have to be made on future occasions in relation to other legislation of this kind, relating to land or other functions of local authorities it might be helpful to record the precedents which justify this decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, the Inland Revenue has agreed that under the Local Government (Financial Provision) Act 1963 the Garden City corporation's issue of bonds falls under the local authority bond provision. In relation to value added tax in the Finance Act 1972, the Customs and Excise informed the corporation that the Commissioners of the Inland Revenue held that the corporation fell within the scope of Section 15(6) of the Finance Act 1972. The Public Works Loan Board has held that the corporation is a local authority for the purposes of the Local Authorities Loans Act 1945, and the then Ministry of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0989">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>781</span>
Housing and Local Government held that the corporation is a local authority as defined in Section 221(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1962. The Department of the Environment has held that the corporation is a local authority for the purposes of the Town and Country Planning (Grants) Regulations 1968, and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government held that as a local authority the corporation had powers under Section 28(2) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1968. Furthermore, the corporation is a local authority within the meaning of the Local Loans Act 1875, and it has been held by the Special Commissioners that the corporation is a local authority for the purposes of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my distinguished predecessors, the late Mr. Martin Maddan, when he was the Member of Parliament for Hitchin, had a substantial part to play in the passage and passing of the Letchworth Garden City Corporation Act 1962, by Section (51) of which the Letchworth Garden City Corporation is a public authority. It is therefore entirely appropriate that the Letchworth Garden City Corporation, although its constitution is anomalous in many respects and has not been repeated for other new towns or foundations, should find its place among the exempt bodies. There has been no repetition of the arrangements for the Letchworth Garden City Corporation, but it nevertheless started the whole idea of new towns in this country, and the results of its work can be inspected with approval by anyone who visits the town of Letchworth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the corporation will be able to continue its activities unhindered by a charge to development land tax in the future, because its work dovetails closely with the North Hertfordshire District Council. If it were not excluded, it would create a large number of local difficulties. I am, therefore, grateful for this opportunity to put on record these remarks about the fair town of Letchworth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 309 seeks to deal with the builder of residential or industrial property separately from others who will be affected by the clause. We have to some extent already dealt with the position of the builder of residential and industrial property, but this argument, which is not quite the same argument, arises on Clause 12. It is an argument which my hon. Friend the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0990">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>783</span>
Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) can put far better than I and, therefore, I merely move the amendment and leave him to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) for being out of the room at the beginning of his speech. I expected the debate on "Clause 11 stand part" to last longer than it did. That must have been the shortest debate on "clause stand part" that we have had.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Brilliant, none the less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) says that it was brilliant, none the less, and I am sure it was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I return to Amendment No. 309 which my right hon. Friend kindly moved. This is a different proposal to that put forward in Amendment No. 308, and is to some extent a fallback position. In Amendment No. 308 we were saying that the developer or builder, when acting as developer or builder, should not pay development land tax, but that he should only pay it when acting, say, as land vendor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That proposal having been rejected by the Committee, we turn now to a secondary proposal, which is that for the ordinary citizen the £10,000 exemption slice should be aggregated through the year but must not exceed £10,000. Thus, if a man makes gains of £3,000 on one site, £3,000 on another and £1,000 on another he is still all right, but the next gain he makes on a site in that year comes within the net of the tax. Rather, we argue that builders should be entitled to a £10,000 slice on each particular site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear, from the nature of such an amendment, that it attempts to reflect the reality of the building industry. A builder does not have only one site going at any one time. He may, if he is a small builder—it may be his only site going—but most building companies have a number of sites going at any one time—or, to be strictly accurate in the terms of the Bill, a number of sites being started at any one time, where deemed disposals are actually taking place. If we cannot convince the Government that builders should have only corporation tax rates on their stock in trade, we thought that a second line of defence for them was
	<span class='label label-info column'>784</span>
that they should have specific £10,000 slice exemptions on each site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister of State will reply that, of course, builders have the special addition, that the Government have tried to take into account the difficulties of the last few years, and so on. That is quite true. But the special addition is temporary. It expires at the end of the four years which Clause 6 envisages, whereas the £10,000 slice, I understand, is intended to be permanent. This is a proposal which attempts to meet the realities of the building industry, to give some help to builders, and to recognise the difficult situation in which many of them are placed when faced with development land tax at the very start of a development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not need to go any more into the effect on builders' cash flows of the deemed disposal procedure. I have already made several speeches in this Committee, so I will simply support my right hon. Friend's amendments at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those who are observant of the proceedings of the Committee and of the Notice Paper will have seen that my name does not stand against the amendment, whereas there are a few others where I am glad to find my name together with that of my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree with the arguments that my hon. Friend advanced and particularly his point about the adverse effects upon the builder's cash flow of having to pay tax at a stage prior to his realisation of any proceeds from the development concerned—in fact the whole problem arising from deemed disposal. That is a problem not just for the builder but for the house purchaser, because those costs will come through to him, and to the consumer, who also benefits from industrial or commercial property, where the costs are increased by the deemed disposal provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point, however, to which I want to draw attention, and the reason my name does not on this occasion stand alongside those of my hon. Friend the Member for Melton and my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page), is that we have stopped at "industrial". This may be a topic to which we shall return later, but I do not want this opportunity to pass without
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0991">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>785</span>
saying that I do not regard a builder of industrial property as requiring special individual treatment as distinct from the builder of commercial property. One might perhaps consider whether all office blocks were good commercial developments, but after all they are used normally for purposes ancillary to industrial or other commercial activities. Indeed, in so far as they are used for the active pursuit of invisible exports by financial institutions, they fulfil a very valuable function. It is regrettable that the amendment stops at "industrial". It would be more likely to command my support were we to add, after "residential or industrial", "or commercial". I do not want to develop this argument at length, because it is a question that we shall return to. But it is something which deserves to be noted as we have this amendment before us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment, as the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) said, is a fallback, because we have not been able to accept some of the other amendments. He made the same point that he and his hon. Friends have made previously and on Second Reading, that a builder should in some way be treated differently from everybody else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument has been that a builder's land is stock-in-trade. This is the only case where stock-in-trade is taxed or subjected to a different tax from other traders' stock-in-trade. Why should this be so? was the original argument. The amendment is a continuation of that argument seeking, as the hon. Gentleman said, to get a £10,000 exemption on the disposal of each site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what the hon. Gentleman means by that or how he defines each site. He does not refer, presumably, to each property on the site, but to the site itself. How we draw a line to decide what is a site I do not know, and it was not clear what the hon. Gentleman wanted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is made quite clear in Amendment No. 315, which is in this group.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not very clear, but I will accept that it is clear and that the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>786</span>
Gentleman knows where he wants his £10,000 exemption. But the answer is that the scheme of the legislation is such that the intention is to tax betterment, be it betterment arising to the builder—albeit his stock-in-trade—or be it betterment arising to somebody who is not a builder. We know that all builders are very worthy people, but there are other worthy people. Even farmers who sell their land can be worthy from time to time and a farmer could say "If you are giving a £10,000 exemption on each sale to that builder down the road, who has had a good deal out of me, why do you deny it to me if I sell two pieces of land?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can imagine a number of arguments from other worthy individuals and organisations that they also should get the benefit of this additional exemption because, taking it to its logical extreme, if a builder disposed of ten sites—if I may use the shorthand expression used in moving the amendment—that would be an exemption of £100,000 a year from development land tax. I accept that that profit would be taxed to corporation tax, or to income tax if it was a sole trader, but an exemption of that order would be substantial and would go completely against the whole basis of the legislation, which is to tax betterment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once one decides to tax betterment, one cannot say that the betterment of builders shall be exempt, or shall be taxed at less than the betterment of everybody else, because the builder's betterment profit is as much fortuitous in many cases as anybody else's betterment profit. It may arise because the builder has done some work, and has found a good site. I am not trying to denigrate the fact that builders often contribute to the building's value, but it is a profit that arises as the result of an external act, a planning permission, and I do not see why builders should receive greater benefit from that than other people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the point made by the hon. Gentleman about deemed disposals. He said that on deemed disposals there will be a cash flow problem and that the proposal in the amendment, if accepted, would ease that problem. We do not believe that there will be a major cash flow problem on deemed disposals. This is because of the spreading provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure hon. Members will not be surprised if I say that I cannot accept the amendment or the amendments taken
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0992">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>787</span>
with it, for the reason that I do not see how or why we should give an exemption from a betterment tax to one group when that group often makes a betterment profit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 164, in page 16, line 30, leave out '£10,000' and insert '£20,000'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 166, in page 16, line 42, leave out '£10,000' and insert '£20,000'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The effect of the three amendments is to attempt to raise the bottom exempt slice from £10,000 to £20,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly give the history of the matter. The bottom exempt slice of development gains tax was £10,000. When the White Paper giving the Government's proposal for the development land tax was first introduced, the bottom exempt slice was to be £5,000. I hope that no one in this Committee will be taken in by that. I hope, too, that we shall not have a lot of whatever is the Welsh equivalent of "blarney"—perhaps it is "hwyll"—about how generous the Government have been in allowing a major extension from £5,000 to £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have no doubt that when a Bill is first thought of a few tightened proposals are put in in the hope that at some stage a few concessions can be made. I have absolutely no doubt that it was always the Government's intention to make the first exempt slice £10,000. It was only a matter of tactics as to when they raised it from £5,000 to £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the Opposition will not be blarneyed out of it. In today's conditions we believe that £10,000 is inadequate. In December 1973, there may have been a case for £10,000, but there has been a lot of inflation since then, and we now have to deal with a tax which will last for quite some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that, in some respects, this is a transitional tax. It is true that churches and charities have a relief which is expected to be transitional in some respects. It is true that the second slice relief up to £150,000 is, again, a transitional relief.
	<span class='label label-info column'>788</span>
But there are other factors in the tax which indicate that this development land tax is likely to be on the statute book for some time. Those who enjoy the slight freedom of being able to develop on excepted development hope to enjoy their slight freedom for some time, although they do not have much protection for that freedom, since it is only granted to them by regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This tax must be on the statute book for three or four years at the least, perhaps for much longer. Therefore, we should look ahead to see what rates of inflation we can expect. Let me take the Government's case at its face value. The Government say that the present rate of inflation is 12 per cent. or 13 per cent. and that the rate of inflation will be down to single figures. I never quite understand what the Government regard as a tolerable rate of inflation. They never say what is a tolerable rate. They usually talk about a level of inflation which will ensure that we are suffering at a rate no worse than our main competitor countries, or a rate that will ensure that the level of unemployment remains at a certain figure or various external factors which are always used as a comparison. The Government never understand the internal social consequences of even a 5 per cent. rate of inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may. Let us take the Government's case as being correct. If we are to have a 9 per cent. or 10 per cent. rate of inflation for the next three, four or five years, it is as well to remember that this rate of inflation is compound. Even on the Government's figures it is right that we should contemplate a total prospective rate Of inflation of perhaps 50 per cent. over the next five years. On that basis, a bottom slice exemption of 10 per cent. which may have been relevant in December, 1973 is no longer relevant. In the two years following 1973 we had a rate of 26 per cent. and another of about 16 per cent. There was a lot of inflation in the pipeline after December 1973.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is only right we on the Conservative side of the Committee should say that a more realistic bottom slice must be fixed. Ifs, contrary to the Government's hope and expectation, the rate of inflation over the next three, four or five years is nothing like as slow as they hope and if the horrifying borrowing requirement of £12 billion—three times more in money figures than Lord Barber's horrifying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0993">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>789</span>
borrowing requirement of £4 billion in 1973—leads to Weimar-type inflation as it could well do, a bottom slice exemption of £10,000 will look absolutely ridiculous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will say that this matter can be reviewed. That is a very unsatisfactory way in which to put legislation on the statute book. It is much better for the building industry to know where it stands. It is much better for the owners of small pieces of land, people, for instance, who own over-large gardens and who want to decide whether to sell off part of their land, to know where they stand rather than to have frequent nudges and winks from the politicians about the way in which the exceptions may be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us have a bottom slice of £20,000, and let us hope that that will remain for some time without being messed around and without people living in a state of total uncertainty about the property market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative which should be realised is that if we set these figures too low the pressure for indexation throughout the whole tax system will become very much stronger. There are strong, even strident, voices in the Tory Party who are committed to supporting indexation. I am highly sceptical about it and feel bound to say that it is dealing with the symptoms of inflation and not with the causes. It is worse than that. With many illnesses, if the symptoms are relieved it may well allow the patient to go on getting worse, without giving the patient that pain which causes him to want to do something about the underlying illness.

If we face high prospective rates of inflation it is better to be honest about it, to recognise that even if our hopes and dreams come about it will be a long job reducing the rate of inflation to the level that all of us who believe in sound money want—perhaps, 3 per cent. or 4 per cent.
	<span class='label label-info column'>790</span>
It is better to fix these tax figures in the unhappy realisation that over-high rates of inflation are likely to be with us for at least three or four years, which is the shortest life that we can anticipate for this particular tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I strongly support my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) and the excellent amendment which he has just moved so capably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to anticipate anything which I might choose to say, were I fortunate enough to catch your eye, Mr. Crawshaw, on Amendment No. 167 which deals with the time when the special relief, the 66⅔ per cent., will be available. I shall leave the majority of my remarks until then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is most difficult to argue whether one figure or another is right. No doubt some Government supporters would prefer to have no exemptions—not even the original £5,000. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West was right when he said that the Government never had any intention to make it £5,000, but that it would be £10,000 all along. If that is so, a lot of people have wasted a lot of time on delegations to the Inland Revenue trying to persuade it to raise the figure from £5,000, which has finally happened. It is difficult to argue why £5,000 or £10,000 or £20,000 is necessarily the right figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come back to the two equal first principles in the Bill. The first equal principle for the Government is undoubtedly the taxation of development gains. That principle is not in dispute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second first equal principle is the ability of the Government to ensure that the Bill will not unreasonably impede the supply of land for house building. They have already made two concessions in this regard—from £5,000 to £10,000, and down to 66⅔ per cent. for the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of land vendors, a £20,000 gain would be a large amount if one were selling, for example, one plot for one house. That would be a substantial gain and it would be reasonable that it it should be taxed at a high rate. On the other hand, a £20,000 gain for a one-acre site with enough space for ten or more houses to be built on it would not be a large gain. If it was the difference between
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0994">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>791</span>
taxing the gain beginning at £10,000 or beginning at £20,000, the fact that the tax began at £10,000 might make all the difference between bringing that one acre of land on to the market or not doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It must be remembered—we have made this point on a number of occasions—that there are many land-owners who do not have any need to bring forward their land for development in the sense that the land may be farming land which can go on being farmed, or orchard land which can go on growing apples, or whatever. His Grace, the Duke of Omnium, does not need to take the cows away; they can go on grazing for ever more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that in the vast majority of cases farmers do not wish to bring their land forward for development because for them it is their stock-in-trade, the land they work and from which they get a living? They are proud in most cases of having continually increased the yield crop.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. That is perfectly true. It is significant—this is a point that he, I and my right hon. Friend made many times during the Committee Stage of the Community Land Bill—that over 40 per cent. of the land coming forward at any one time is white land, land not zoned for development. In many cases that land has been sought out by the builder who persuades the farmer to allow planning application to take place—quite often, initially, against the farmer's better judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall make no more of this. It is solely a matter of judgment. I can only give my judgment to the Committee, as someone practically involved in these matters, which is that although £10,000 is better than £5,000—given that the rate of tax is to be high and given the overriding need to see that land comes forward properly for housing development for the next few years—it would be much better for the Government to start at £20,000. If, in a few years' time, they consider that they should tighten it up, they can always do so. But let it be remembered that they intend to go to a 100 per cent. rate of tax in a few years' time when we reach the second appointed day, if we ever do, under the Community Land Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>792</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, would like to support my hon. Friends the Members for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) and Melton (Mr. Latham)). The Minister of State faces a difficult problem in striking a balance. I think it was Professor Wheatcroft—not the roses man, but the taxes man—who said that every new tax is a bad tax. What he was getting at was that, inevitably, new taxes have to be run in, and inevitably—perhaps like new cars—when they are being run in, there are hiccoughs, difficulties and anomalies which had not been expected. However diligently we may do our work in this Committee and on the Floor of the House, problems will arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In striking this balance it seems to me that there is more sense in starting with a higher level of exemption and working down rather than starting too low and then putting it up. We will run in that tax with much less inconvenience both to taxpayers and to tax gatherers than by doing it the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The balance that the Minister, the Treasury and the Government have to strike is, to my mind, one between administrative costs and a worthwhile input from the tax. With some taxes, presumably, high administrative costs would be justified because of the purpose of the tax. One could argue that this tax is one of those, because its purpose is to introduce a specially high level of taxation, moving in due course to 100 per cent. on what have been called windfall gains. It may be said that that would justify, for what is regarded as a very necessary tax, fairly high administrative costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I suggest that the sort of windfall gains that have aroused considerable public disquiet and led to a clamour for a form of taxation to which I admit the Conservative Government were slow to react, were not gains of £10,000 or £20,000, or even £30,000 or £40,000, but were gains of several hundreds of thousands of pounds. In one or two cases, indeed, they were gains of £1 million or more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, these amendments would in no way contradict the purpose of the new tax and, presumably, would reduce the administrative costs of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another factor, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Melton spoke, and which needs to be taken into the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0995">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>793</span>
balance. We are not just weighing two items. We are weighing more than two, because the third factor—the working of the economy—is an important one. I am including in that third factor the supply of houses, which is, clearly, an important part of the social aspects of the economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suggest to the Minister that if raising the exemption limit from £10,000 to £20,000 will reduce the risks which many of us think are very strong in the supply of land for housing, commercial development and industrial development and which are inherent in a tax of this nature, it would be well worth while looking at such a move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is worth reminding the Committee that we are not dealing with a situation in which, with an exemption limit of £20,000, the first £20,000 is free of tax. Anything which is exempt from this special form of taxation, which both sides of the Committee agree is justified, is still subject to the other forms of taxation that are on the statute book, particularly in this case, capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, when we are fixing an exemption limit for development land tax, it is not the same as fixing an exemption limit for most taxes, where we are saying "Below this there will be no taxation. Beyond this normal taxation, we will have this special tax which will be complicated and at least have potential problems in interfering with the working of the economy, because we believe it is necessary to deal with the problem of the windfall gains and the problem of betterment".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What information does the Minister have? I do not know whether he has very much information, or whether any sample surveys have been carried out. If a lot of work has been done on the land market, what information does the Minister have of the number of transactions which would fall into the £10,000 to £20,000 category after the calculation has been done on the basis of base A, base B or base C, whichever is the most favourable for the taxpayer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be difficult for the Minister to answer. He may have very little information, even on the basis of a survey. I suspect that, particularly in the housing market, the figure would be fairly substantial, notably in the smaller-scale commercial developments, those just above the exempted development level. If that
	<span class='label label-info column'>794</span>
is right, what estimates does the Minister have of handling one tax demand arising from one deemed disposal or actual disposal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Actual disposals should be relatively straightforward. It is the deemed disposals that will be difficult. One will be making valuations all the time, and they will be argued about, and some will, presumably, go to the Lands Tribunal. Those will give rise to the major workload.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Minister any estimate as to the cost of handling a relatively small demand? What estimates has he of the revenue that will arise from this level of tax, the tax that will be levied on realised development value between £10,000 and £20,000 more than the base value? I believe that the yield would be extremely small, and would be disproportionate to the administrative burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those questions lead me to wonder whether the Minister will be able to say now whether the Board will publish an annual review of the workings of the tax, the number of cases where they have fallen, and the problems that arise. Even if we get—not the Welsh equivalent of "blarney" that my hon Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) suggested—but a negative reply on the suggestion of raising the limits, experience of the operation of the tax might rapidly bring us round to agreeing with my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West that the limit should be raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought that, whether or not we get a helpful reply from the Minister, there will be a strong case for a careful review of the operation of the tax, and particularly the adminstrative costs of the tax, at an early stage. I hope that that review will take into account the effects on the workings of the economy as well as the more directly tax-related points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, essentially the Minister has to strike a balance between the purposes of the tax, the workings of the economy, and the administrative costs. I support my hon. Friends most strongly in saying that my judgment is that the purposes of the tax would not be weakened, but the administrative costs would be reduced and the workings of the economy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0996">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>795</span>
facilitated, by a more realistic exemption level—which is supported by the CBI and by other organisations—below which other forms of taxation would apply, but not the development land tax. Therefore, I strongly support this group of amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), in moving his amendment, was persuasive—indeed, almost beguiling—when he said that he agreed with Treasury Ministers that we should have no indexation.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A heart? They should not have hearts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Occasionally, in development land tax committees, they do. Despite that, I cannot—and the hon. Gentleman would not expect me to—go along with much of his argument. He must not assume that we are as Machiavellian as he thought. If we had been, we would have kept the limit to £5,000. Then he would have tabled an amendment suggesting £10,000 or possibly £20,000, and this afternoon my hon. Friend or I would have stood up and said "We will give you £10,000". But, because we are not Machiavellian, we listened to representations. Most of the representations—or many of them—asked for £10,000. Some asked for £20,000, but many, if I remember rightly, asked for £10,000 and, instead of holding it all back for the Committee, we were sincere in our offer of consultation and were persuaded by the representations that £10,000 might be a better figure. No one can be certain which is the right figure, as the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) said, but we were prepared to give the organisations the benefit of the doubt when they asked for £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we are told that the CBI wants £20,000. No doubt if we had put £20,000 in the Bill we would have been told that the CBI wanted £30,000, and so on. I make no complaint about that. The Opposition are under a duty, to some extent, to probe these matters and try to reduce the level of taxation. That is a difficulty we face.
	<span class='label label-info column'>796</span>
We chose the figure of £10,000 after representations were made to us, hoping that we were striking the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee that it is not just the £10,000. We are also talking about a 66⅔ per cent. slice on the next £150,000, and then 80 per cent. on top. Our original proposals were £5,000 plus 80 per cent. We are now in a regime of £10,000 plus 66⅔ per cent. plus 80 per cent. So, as a result of the representations we received, we moved a considerable way to meet the fears of many people that land would not be coming on to the market over the next three years if the original proposals were put into practice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, those who make representations are grateful when they are listened to. But, from what the Minister has just said, could he perhaps give an undertaking that the exemption limit would, at the very least, be reviewed at the end of the period when the concessionary low rate of taxation of 66⅔ per cent. comes to an end?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should know very well that Treasury Ministers are not permanent, and that even they cannot give undertakings about what is to happen in the future. But the House of Commons, we hope, is permanent. Finance Bills come every year, and no doubt there will be plenty of opportunities in the next three or four years to look at the figures. Amendments will be tabled and the matters will be debated, and no doubt, if there is considerable concern about it, the rate may be changed. I know not. That is the way we do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, I should have thought that £10,000 was a fair figure. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West said that since 1973–74 inflation has got worse. I am not sure that it has in property values. I seem to remember that the values were very high at that time and that they have come down to a considerable extent. I accept that there has been an increase in inflation, but property is a special case. The value of property has not gone up since 1973–74.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that. Inflation is a general rise in prices and it is not to be confused with what some people call inflation when they refer to the price of particular commodities or services. All I said was that there had been a lot
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0997">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>797</span>
of inflation, by which I meant general inflation, since 1973. The Minister is right when he says that there has been a substantial fall in property prices since the end of 1973.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says. We are looking at a tax on property values. The figure of £10,000, I should have thought, was fair bearing in mind that, if he wants to pursue the inflation argument, property values have not risen considerably but have fallen since 1973–74. It is a matter of balance and judgment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) mentioned administration and said that if one had £20,000 one would have fewer administrative problems. I do not really think that is so, because here we are giving a slice exemption, which is different from the original development gains tax exemption. That was not a slice but a small disposals or proceeds exemption of £10,000, with a tapering provision up to £20,000. But that was a proceeds exemption, not a gains exemption. If one sold for £10,000, one was out of the tax. If one sold for £19,000, one was out of the tax for £10,000 and there was tapering relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Finance Bill we shall amend development gains tax to bring it into line with this legislation because we think it is fairer to give a slice exemption rather than a small disposals exemption with a tapering relief. The development gains tax exemption was probably less generous than the £10,000 slice exemption that we are now proposing. I think it is a fair and reasonable figure and no doubt in future it will be discussed and debated again in relation to what happens to property values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other concessions that we have announced—the 66⅔ per cent. especially—will help to ensure that property comes on to the market in the next two to three years and that the house building industry will not be inhibited as a result of not having enough land to build houses on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be helpful if we got the record right on one point. The Minister referred to the reduction in property prices since 1973, and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton,
	<span class='label label-info column'>798</span>
South-West said the same. The one area where prices have not gone down but have increased is in industrial property, most categories of warehouse property and, to some extent, reasonable quality shop property. Industrial property is the clearest area. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister now features the 	<i>Estates Gazette</i> among his regular reading and he will have seen references to this in recent editions. This may be the explanation why the CBI is to be found among those asking for this higher exemption. This is one reason why these exemption limits are critical to the flow of land for industrial purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain why I referred to the general level of inflation and not to the price of property. We have an interesting and strange position in the property market which illustrates best of all the way in which inflation creates uncertainty and how difficult it is to understand what the effect of inflation will be on any one commodity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the upturn towards the peak of the 1971–73 boom the price of property was often higher than the cost of building that property, higher than the replacement cost. What exists now is the reverse situation in that the replacement cost is very much higher than the money value of property. If it be that we are in the bottom or coming off the bottom of a trough in the economy, and if it be that we are back into the position that we were in, say, late in 1971 and starting to move up towards what I hope will not be an extremely inflationary boom, the probability is that once again the money value of property will exceed the replacement cost of that property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that asset values have been unduly fiercely attacked by the uncertainties of the last three years. But it is not safe for the Minister to rely upon the way in which the market in property has moved, in a very erratic way, in the course of the last three years. We are contemplating here a tax which is likely to be on the statute book for three, four or five years, perhaps more, and the probability is that we shall all be very red-faced if we look at this debate in five years' time and see that the figure of £10,000 is completely irrelevant to the proper operation of this tax when the Bill has become an Act and has been in operation for some time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 113, in page 17, line 20, leave out '12th September 1974' and insert '16th March 1976'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with Clause 12(4) and (5), we are dealing with very technical anti-avoidance sections. It is for that reason that I feel sad that the Minister of State—a one-time professional avoider—should have left us. Perhaps I can explain from the booklet what the position is in relation to subsections (4) and (5). It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The £10,000 exemption is not given in the case of disposals to which Clause 5(5) applies (acquisition of an interest in land from a connected person and disposal within a year). Neither is it given in the case of a disposal where the person making the disposal is not an individual (e.g. a company) and that person acquired the interest at an under-value, after 12th September 1974, from a connected person and within the previous six years. Such transactions arc excluded from the calculation of development value realised in the financial year for the purpose of allocating the £10,000 exemption to other disposals.</p></blockquote>
We all accept that there have to be anti-avoidance measures, that there must not be methods by which people can shift land around the family and around companies at less than market value in order to allow a number of connected persons each to acquire the benefit of the first £10,000 exempted slice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any legislation of this sort will necessarily be complicated. Any legislation of this sort will be attacked—there is no other word for it—by the finest brains in the land with a view to avoiding taxation. Of necessity, there is a continuing war between the Inland Revenue, the tax Bar and the accountancy profession as they seek, on the one hand, to tighten these avoidance proposals and, on the other, either to loosen them or, more probably,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>800</span>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 11.</p>
	<p>to escape through the mistakes and interstices in these complicated erections.</p>
	<p>We accept all that, but there remains an issue of principle, that there must be certainty in taxation and there must be proper parliamentary discussion before even the worst, most horrible tax avoider is caught by the steely eye of the Revenue.</p>
	<p>The Opposition submit that it is quite wrong to have legislation by White Paper. This is what including the date of 12th September 1974 means. It means that the White Paper is issued and thereafter the cloak of secrecy has gone and it is said that everything shall start to bite from the date when the White Paper is published. For the record, 12th September 1974 was the date on which the Government issued their White Paper on land in that preliminary period when they were both frightening the Conservatives with their profusion of White Papers published at the taxpayers' expense, and no doubt delighting their supporters with the prospect of telling the capitalist society that it would not be able to live in future.</p>
	<p>None the less, even the tax evaders and land speculators are entitled to some proper constitutional protection. They should not be taxed until Parliament has properly discussed the ways in which they are to be taxed. The Opposition therefore say that this avoidance measure should not bite until after Second Reading on 16th March of this year. For my part, that does not go far enough.</p>
	<p>I believe that legislation should not bite until it has received the Royal Assent, but that may be an extreme attitude. None the less, as a compromise attitude we say that it should not bite until after the legislation on development land tax has received the approval of the House on Second Reading. That is an issue of principle which applies to all punitive taxation of this type. It is important that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0999">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>801</span>
it should apply even to avoiders. It is important that it should apply even where later there is the £10,000 exemption, which is an easement from the £5,000.</p>
	<p>What is an advantage to one person may be a disadvantage to another. People have to make their commercial judgments about the effect of taxation. The fact that somebody has only a £5,000 exemption may be a critical factor as to whether he sells as compared to whether he sells with the benefit of a £10,000 exemption. These are all important matters which should be finally decided by Parliament and not by the publication of a White Paper. I know that the Treasury Minister will not pretend that the fact that it is an anti-avoidance section in any way lessens the force of this principle.</p>
	<p>It is important that constitutional proprieties should be adhered to in respect of the nastiest things in society, and in respect of the most unpleasant people. We can never have the argument—"The accused is accused of a very unpleasant offence. Therefore, he should be accorded a lower standard of justice". It is precisely because this is an anti-avoidance section that the very highest standards of constitutional propriety ought to be applied.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) says, this is a very technical area concerned with anti-avoidance sections of the Bill. I was very pleased to note his acceptance of the need of such general anti-avoidance measures. Some of the more difficult parts of any Finance Bill legislation, or any legislation concerned with taxation, deal with some of the anti-avoidance measures, all of which are readily capable of easy explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to say something about the consequences if this amendment were to be carried. As the hon. Gentleman rightly points out, it is one of a number of anti-avoidance measures introduced into the Bill, and we will be coming to the next one in the next amendment. Perhaps I might put the consequence of this amendment, if it were to be carried, in the form of an example, and then state the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a company were to divide land, amongst the various subsidiary companies of its group of companies, then each member, under this amendment, would get
	<span class='label label-info column'>802</span>
the benefit of the £10,000 exemption. It is not difficult to see that this is a convenient loophole which needs to be stopped and the legislation so stops it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will leave that aspect and deal with the general important case that the hon. Gentleman quite rightly makes. He mentioned that it is wrong to deal with legislation by means of a White Paper. I feel sure we would all agree that, if we can wait until the details of the legislation are before the Committee, where we can examine it in the way in which we are able to examine it on this occasion, there is no substitute for that. Undoubtedly, this was the way in which these matters used to be dealt with on the Floor of the House in more leisurely days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Today, unfortunately, we have Finance Bills, Bills dealing with taxation of very great size that come before us each year. It may be that under any Government of the future the size which has been growing will continue to grow to such a level that a halt at one stage may have to be called. It is not for me to go into those details now. I just mention the complexities that have to be examined in order to deal with the very point that the hon. Gentleman made when he talked about the Bills that we have which are attacked by the finest brains in the land. Those are the very real problems that one has, with the very real brains finding the loopholes that have to be stopped, getting them stopped and then being attacked by the finest brains. This kind of adversary role one can see developing without limits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only thing that I would say—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. May I just finish this, as I do not wish to end on the note of despair that might be suggested by the comments that I have just made? The only thing I would say is that there are approaches to legislation that deal with these loopholes and the avoidance which I think that we shall certainly have to consider. However, I do not think that this arises on the development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) made the point that we are dealing with new taxes which introduce new problems, and obviously the solutions to those new problems one does not get wholly right. I think that we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1000">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>803</span>
made a better approach in this new form of taxation than perhaps many that we have seen in the past. I can think of some introduced by the previous Government, without going into the wider area. But of course these are capable of amendment by subsequent Finance Bills. I think that this approach offers the best hopes for the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly understand the hon. Gentleman's concept that as one intensifies financial legislation the finest brains find loopholes in it so that one then has to plug the loopholes. But does the Minister not appreciate that it is the intensification and complexity of the tax and the persecution of people's ability to make profits and make a living that compels them to get fine brains to find their way out of the cage which his party is creating for everybody?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I thought that that was so, I might have expected to see the amount of Finance Bill legislation decrease under the previous Administration. But it did not do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Alas!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It increased at proportionately as high a rate as anything that we have seen. So I do not think that one ought to make party points on this. Over the past 20 years one has seen a steady increase year by year. Those are the problems, but perhaps we can discuss them on another occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not only the complexity of legislation. It is the level of taxation. If taxation were at a lower level, it would be possible to have it simpler because the inducement to engage in avoidance would be so much less.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard those arguments, but following Tony Barber's reduction in taxation I saw even larger Finance Bills, which tended to reduce my belief in that connection between cause and effect. We have this loophole. As regards the transfer of land within groups, of course there is no development land tax on deals within groups, under the provisions of Clause 20.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this is an essential anti-avoidance section, which if the tax is to
	<span class='label label-info column'>804</span>
remain intact we shall certainly need to provide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to join issue with the Financial Secretary on this amendment, as if we strongly oppose this I am sure that we shall be labelled as being anti anti-avoidance. That is the last thing that can be said of we on this side of the Committee. Therefore, to a great extent I take the need for a provision such as this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) argued his case on the basis that this was legislation by White Paper and not by statute. I doubt whether it was even legislation by White Paper. I do not know whether the Financial Secretary can refer me to any part of the White Paper on Land where this anti-avoidance provision was mentioned. I think that it came new to everybody, not perhaps on the Second Reading but on the printing of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree that, especially in anti-avoidance measures, immediately they are known they should take effect. To that extent, it is usual in Finance Bills to make the provision retrospective. I stand to be corrected, but I do not believe that this provision was mentioned in the White Paper. It was certainly not mentioned in the draft Bill which was published in August 1975. I have that in front of me and I find no such provision in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To that extent, this form of legislation, going back for nearly two years on transactions which took place at that time without any knowledge that they would be treated in the final legislation as avoidance, is most questionable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary has put forward a case—I shall not use the strong word "blackmail"—for anti-avoidance. The last thing I want to do is vote against anti-avoidance provisions, but to date back for nearly two years a provision of this sort, without any notice, is a questionable way to legislate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 159, in page 18, line 17, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7A) Where subsection (7) above applies the amount of the development value realised on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1001">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>805</span>
disposal may at the option of the chargeable person be calculated as if the relevant base value were any one of Base A, Base B and Base C.'</p></blockquote>
Here again, we are dealing with complicated anti-avoidance provisions, and subsections (6) and (7) are described in the explanatory booklet as dealing
	<br><blockquote><p>"with the case where there is a disposal of assembled land (see Part I, Schedule 2) in such circumstances that, had one or more of the parts making up the assembly been separately disposed of, subsections (4) and (5) would apply."</p></blockquote>
Subsections (4) and (5) are those we were considering a moment ago, albeit in a specialised way, on the last amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We repeat that these anti-avoidance measures are necessary, but we are concerned that the measures should not go too far, and that the avoiders, unsocial though they may be, should not be unfairly treated. We are concerned that, where a person is caught by the effect of subsections (6) or (7), he may find himself in a very unfavourable position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We invite the Minister, therefore, to explain what the practical effect of subsections (6) and (7) will be upon those who are caught. We are putting forward these proposals in the belief that they will give to the person caught by subsection (7) a certain amount of room for manoeuvre. They will give him the room for manoeuvre that the option that he has as between base A, base B and base C gives to him. I regret that it will also cast upon the Revenue that duty we discussed earlier of finding out which is the most advantageous base for the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to know exactly how subsection (6) or (7) will work, and to be satisfied that a person caught by subsection (7) will not be locked into an extremely unfair and disadvantageous base value. If there is any risk of his being locked in in that way, we suggest that Amendment No. 159 will give him more latitude by allowing him a choice of base value.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) pointed out, this is probably one of the more complex parts of the Bill. In working through the difficulties of the amendment, I was impressed with its ingenuity. It takes a rather unusual case, and I shall explain what it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment concerns a person who cannot make use of the £10,000 exemption
	<span class='label label-info column'>806</span>
against his other development gains because he has not had that amount of development value. It concerns a person who purchases within six years from a connected person—perhaps a relative or close friend—at less than market value. Because I shall need to refer to it a number of times, perhaps the Committee will allow me to call it a suspect transaction, but there is no emotive connotation in that. It is a transaction suspected of being from a connected person at a value less than its true value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That person then resells in a situation where he is not eligible for the £10,000 exemption given to him by the Bill. That is, he sells land in that year during which his other land, his total land, is less than £10,000, excluding this suspect transaction for which he cannot claim the exemption because it is a sale in the way I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with that particular item within an assembly: that is, he has an assembly of land, part of which is perfectly in order—an innocent part of the transaction where he is entitled to claim the full £10,000 limit—and part is the suspect bit of that land. He cannot put that suspect bit towards his £10,000 exemption limit, but nevertheless he is disposing of the whole of the assembly, parts of which are of the kind that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill as it stands, the suspect bit is separate. The denial of the £10,000 exemption is a denial only for the suspect bit. If the innocent part of this assembly—please do not attach emotive significance to these words, because it may be all perfectly in order—or any other transaction that he may have in the year, uses up the £10,000, the denial of relief to the suspect bit does not affect or hurt him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, therefore, considering an extremely unusual case. It has to be an assembly; part of it has to be with a connected person; and he must have a total amount of less than £10,000. The amendment here, in order to meet the requirements of the case, must be concerned with less than £10,000, and only in that case will the denial of what would be his rights otherwise hurt him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this most unusual situation, the advantage to him of using a base value most convenient to him would be marginally better for him. That is where the ingenuity of the amendment shows itself most. Normally, the highest base is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1002">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>807</span>
used because that is nearly always of the greatest advantage to the individual concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill does not provide for the right of election by the individual, the reason being, first, that it is nearly always to his advantage to choose the highest base, and second, it avoids unnecessary complications that could arise in many parts of the Bill. But were he to be given his right of election, not for the general case but for this peculiar and unusual situation, the complications could be enormous for those looking for this kind of situation in every transaction that came before them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount of good that it might do is so limited, the amount of complication with which we are concerned is so large, and the case I have described is so rare, that I find myself, while admiring the amendment, unable to accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost thought that the Financial Secretary would refer to the housemaid who said that it was only a little one. I humbly congratulate him on the admirable explanation he gave to the Committee. It was such a brilliant explanation that I thought that in the end he would accept the amendment. In fact, he has rejected the amendment on two grounds—first, that it would cause a lot of complications. But I submit that it would not. He has, indeed, explained how it would not. It would apply in this particular case, one which is most unusual, I agree, and I do not see how the amendment could extend beyond the sort of case which he explained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is, therefore, a very restricted amendment. I cannot see how it could possibly lead to avoidance. It would just apply to that specific case instanced by the Financial Secretary. In these circumstances, I should have thought that here he would be generous to the Opposition for having devised an amendment which picked out a rather unusual position but one where the person chargeable, unless given the chance under the option, would suffer some hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Financial Secretary, therefore, to be generous on this occasion and allow us this amendment. His whole explanation of it was that it will do no damage. It is a complicated amendment but one which applies to certain cases. I commend both my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) and the Financial Secretary for
	<span class='label label-info column'>808</span>
explaining what it all meant. Now that we have come 	<i>ad idem</i> on it, I should have thought that he could accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say that when I first fully realised the consequences of the amendment and I was attracted to the case that could be made out, I looked at it with greater interest than when I first turned to it. But the Committee must accept that there is the problem of the situation in the whole of this tax whereby the highest base is the one used, without the right of election.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is the proper way to proceed for the main part of the legislation, it will be very hard to provide for an election in this very peculiar and narrow instance. If it is right to allow an election of bases in this instance, clearly, the whole question of looking to the right of election for the base generally would need to be further examined, with the complication that I described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of it all one can always look for individual cases, however small, and try to allow certain exceptions here and there. But either we are to face the problems of anomalies—which might apply here between the election of bases in this instance and the general non-election that is available elsewhere—or we have the further problem of increasing the whole volume of legislation if we look for particular instances. That is one of the causes of the increase in size of legislation concerned with taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both these considerations apply here, but I would not take my stand on the second, because the Opposition know full well that we always approach matters with a soft heart, trying to remedy particular injustices, however small they are, or particular acts which might be considered to be unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to provide for the election of bases, having made the election the taxpayer might need time to consider which base he wishes. He might change his mind, because it might be in the same financial year and there would be problems in that kind of delay. There would need to be provision for time limits as to the making of the election. This would mean a fair amount of legislation for what is an extremely small point concerning a rare case of the kind that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1003">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>809</span>
In view of its repercussions on other parts of the legislation, with the greatest will in the world—because of the points that I made earlier—I am unable to be generous.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without indulging in tedious repetition I must say that I am sure that the argument which the Financial Secretary was advised to give when he first answered my hon. Friend did not have "Reject" at the top of the paper. I am certain it did not have "Accept" either, but I should have thought, by the way he put it to the Committee, that it had "Consider" at the top. If he would tell us that he will consider this again, while we are considering what he has said, we might see whether we can overcome, with another amendment, the broadening of this—either broadening in its application to individuals or broadening in its drafting in the Bill. If we are able to think of some amendment which will meet those objections I hope he will also think about it before the next stage of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have hoped on an amendment of this sort, where we seem to be very much of one mind, that we could look at it again without prejudicing its examination by dividing the Committee. We can allow it to be negatived, or even withdrawn. There is, however, no ground for withdrawing it unless the Financial Secretary is a little more forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>'Provide that nothing in this section or in section 30 shall treat as an interest in land forming part of the assets of the partnership any interest which allows the partners to occupy rent free land owned by any one of the partners'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments can be broadly described as dealing with the partners and with a substantial issue of principle and detail. This is an area where we hope that the Government will give careful consideration to what we have to say for we believe that if they do not they and this legislation will get into very substantial difficulties in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind the Committee of what the Explanatory Notes say about partners, the matter dealt with in subsections (9) and (10). They say that those subsections:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provide special rules for partnerships. Except for disposals falling within subsection (5), a partnership is treated as an individual with a single exemption of £10,000. For this purpose a change in the membership of the partnership is disregarded if an election could be made for the continuation basis of assessment for income tax purposes, whether or not an election is in fact made".</p></blockquote>
That puts—or would put if the Government do not reconsider the matter—partners in a special and disadvantageous position. I take the case of a husband and wife who are each given a special exemption. Here I shall quote the clear undertaking given by the then Paymaster-General on Second Reading, when he said, with reference to the first slice:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There are other examples of changes. For example, originally it was proposed that a husband and wife should share a single £5,000 exemption. We have decided that as they are treated separately for other development land tax purposes they should each have, in normal circumstances, their own exemption, that is £10,000 each.—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 941.]</p></blockquote>
We are dealing here with a very technical area in which, in the past, the tax system has made a fool of itself. None of us on this Committee would wish to see this Bill make a fool of itself. If we allow subsections (9) and (10) to remain in their present form, there will be difficulty and uncertainty on a practical level in relation to incoming and outgoing partners. There will be difficulty and uncertainty in relation to changes in asset-sharing ratios. There
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1004">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>811</span>
will be problems when there is a distribution of the partnership assets and that distribution is done 	<i>in specie.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is exactly the same problem about which the then Labour Government were warned in 1965, when they were introducing the capital gains legislation. Like all Governments, they bashed on. They said that the problems were not real problems, that what we said was no more than an attempt to delay the passage of the Bill, and that there would not be difficulties. What happened? A very discreditable thing happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After some time, the Revenue realised that there were real difficulties with the capital gains legislation. Under the veil of the greatest possible secrecy, the Board of Inland Revenue had discussions with the Law Society and the allied accountancy bodies about the capital gains treatment of partnerships. Lo and behold, Issue No. 6 of the 1975 	<i>British Tax Review</i> comes out with a statement on what is modestly described as a number of points of general practice which have been agreed by the Board of Inland Revenue and these two undemocratic professional bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They came to an agreement about: (1) nature of the asset liable to tax, (2) disposals of assets by a partnership, (3) partnership assets divided in kind among the partners, (4) changes in partnership sharing ratios, (5) adjustments through the accounts, (6) payments outside the accounts, (7) transfers between persons not at arm's-length, (8) annuities provided by partnerships, (9) mergers, (10) shares acquired in stages, (11) elections under Schedule 11 to the Finance Act 1968, and (12) transitional arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us have no attempt to shrug this off and say that it was practical elucidation of principles that had already been laid down and approved by Parliament and the Sovereign. Let there be no such rubbish as that. It quite plainly contemplated that this deal, this illegal deal, would have a practical effect as though it were law, because at the end it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The practices set out in this statement will be applied to all capital gains tax assessments after today. Where tax liabilities have already been settled on other reasonable bases the assessments will not be upset. Often gains and losses on previous disposals will have been computed on a different basis and the acquisition costs allocated as a result to partners to set against future disposals will be different from those which would have arisen had the new practices been followed.
	<span class='label label-info column'>812</span>
Such costs can only be recalculated in exceptional circumstances. Inland Revenue, 17th January 1975".—</p></blockquote>
nearly 10 years after the passing of the capital gains legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Serious issues arise if this present Bill has to be dealt with in that way. We can already see power slipping away from Parliament as one Government after another make deals with either the CBI or the TUC. We are not only seeing power slipping away from Parliament; we are also seeing power slipping away from politicians. It is an interesting fact that while, on the one hand, we see the political parties screaming in the fashionable way for what they call "State support"—by which they mean a bit of the taxpayers' money—on the other hand, the bodies which represent the interest groups get bigger, stronger and richer every day. Every one of them campaigns before its own membership, or prospective membership, on the basis of how effective it has been in lobbying the Government of the day to give some form of concession to each of the interest groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This happens for one reason only. Legislation is bashed through this place at such a speed that even if Members of Parliament were unrepresentative in their high standard of intelligence, they would none the less have no chance whatever of understanding the highly technical issues dealt with in the great flood of legislation which goes through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, necessarily, the only people who can represent these special interests are the various trade associations and other groups. They trot off to the Treasury. They trot off to the Board of Trade. The real deals are not made by our Committees or on the Floor of the House; they are persistently being made by the various interest groups, the various highly paid, much subscribed to interest groups which have taken power away from the politicians and from the political parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we, the politicians, want to involve ourselves in issues concerning the nation, then we ought to be representing these special interests. In this instance, it is worse than that because not only did we continue the process of giving away the right effectively to represent the interests of the British people where they are affected in their commercial transactions, but we did something worse. In this instance, plainly and wholly unlawfully,

the right of passing legislation was delegated to the Inland Revenue and to a combination of the Law Society and the allied accountancy bodies.

That was a thoroughly disagreeable manifestation of the corporate State. The remedy is in our hands this evening. We can say to all the Treasury Ministers that this has already been proved to be an extremely difficult area of the law. Sweeping suggestions have been made by which only one exemption will be given to the whole changing body of a partnership. That is plainly unfair and something which has been done because the complexities which so troubled those who had to deal with the capital gains legislation cannot be faced. If it is difficult, let the Ministers take it away. But let us not have some sort of deal by which the complexity and difficulty are recognised, first in secret, and finally in some form of illegal manifestation of the corporate State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the amendments and the inter-relationship between subsections (9) and (10), which we seek to delete with Amendments Nos. 120 and 163, and the inter-action of those with Clause 30. This is extremely difficult to understand. The whole position regarding partnerships is confused. Normally, one looks through the partnership and treats each partner as disposing personally of his appropriate portion of the land. But for the purpose of the £10,000 exemption this does not apply; instead, the firm is to be treated as a separate individual. It is not to be entitled, however, to the more generous anti-avoidance provisions that relate to individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not at all easy to work that out from the Bill as it stands, and that is the purpose of several of our amendments, in particular the amendments in detail which are grouped with Amendment No. 120. They do not in any way alter the Governments intention as it stands in the Bill; they are merely an attempt to improve the drafting and make the Bill more comprehensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I refer to a point in the submission of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors which I believe ought to be brought to the Committees attention:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While we welcome the increase in the proposed level of exemption, we note that Clause 12(9)"</p></blockquote>
—which Amendment No. 120 would delete—
	<br><blockquote><p>"limits the exemption in the case of partnerships in such a way that the partnership is entitled to only one £10,000 'slice' of exempt realised
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1006">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>815</span>
development value in any one year. We believe that this limitation is inequitable, since other concurrent owners of interests in land, for example joint tenants, may each be entitled to the benefit of a separate exemption 'slice'. We suggest, therefore, that partnerships, other than those whose sole or main business is trading in land, should be entitled to a separate £10,000 exemption 'slice' for each partner. This would be consistent with the intention to tax partners separately in Clause 30."</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to look at this matter again very carefully, not only from the point of view of intelligibility, to which the RICS and others have referred, and which I mentioned a moment ago, but also, for example, of the effect on my own industry, the building industry. In the building industry there are a large number of partnership firms, most of them extremely reputable organisations, paying their income tax under Schedule D in the normal way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The system by which the aggregation is to take place for the purpose of the £10,000 slice seems to me to be unfair. I see no reason for it whatever. If a partnership firm goes bankrupt—I am negotiating with the Government about just such a case at the moment—the partners will normally be jointly and severally liable for the tax to the Revenue. If, for example, there is a debt of £1,000, they will each be required to pay £333, or if one does not pay anything the others will be required to make up the difference and the £1,000 debt will have to be met. I see no reason why, when the boot is on the other foot and a gain is made, the exemption of £10,000 has to be disallowed for each of the partners. That does not seem fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will look at this matter again. I think that my hon. Friends amendment is very reasonable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to add a few remarks about Amendment No. 319. This proposes that the following words should be added at the end of subsection (9):
	<br><blockquote><p>'Provided that nothing in this section or in section 30 shall treat as an interest in land forming part of the assets of the partnership any interest which allows the partners to occupy rent free land owned by any one of the partners'.</p></blockquote>
There may be deficiencies in the drafting of the amendment. A similar amendment, No. 320, has been tabled to the following clause, and it may be that the amendments have not been proposed in the right place in
	<span class='label label-info column'>816</span>
the Bill. But I think that their point is clear, and I hope that we can be told that they are not necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The danger with which we are concerned is, if there are changes in the assets, or changes in the ratios of partnerships, which relate to property of the occupation of premises in the ordinary course of the pattern of partnership—a farming, accountancy or solicitors' partnership—that by some means, where-ever it may be in the Bill, such a transaction might technically be regarded as a transaction which would give rise to development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A partnership of six persons might have, say, two solicitors in each of three towns. In one case, one solicitor might own the property, and in another the property might be jointly owned. At some point, involving not a change in the membership of the partnership but a change in the property arrangements, there could be circumstances in which the terms on which individual partners occupied the properties within the partnership changed. We are anxious that, either by means of this amendment—or some other provision which may already be in the Bill, and if so, we shall be glad to have it pointed out—such a circumstance should not lead to an unwitting liability to development land tax on any, or all, of those partners, individually or collectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) constructed a large edifice on a narrow, technical, but important, point relating to the law of partnership. I shall confine my remarks to that important point regarding the taxation of partnerships under this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman, perhaps unwittingly, did not draw a sufficiently clear distinction between the dealings of the partnership with the outside world and the dealings of the partners 	<i>inter se</i> among themselves. The Bill clearly draws that distinction, more clearly than have some Bills in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that in the past Ministers and the Inland Revenue have not always been right with legislation on partnerships, because partnerships do not fall neatly, like options. They are different from most concepts, and there have been difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this legislation the position is reasonably clear in that we are drawing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1007">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>817</span>
the distinction between partnerships dealing with the outside world and partnerships involved in transactions between each other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall refer first to the situation where the partnership deals with the outside world, covered by Clause 12(9). The part of the Bill which covers partners dealing with each other is Clause 30(	<i>a</i>). We have, therefore, two concepts—the partnership dealing with the outside world, dealt with in Clause 12(9) and the partners dealing between themselves in Clause 30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments appear to relate, in the main, to the first concept. The Bill treats the partnership as one individual. It may be argued that the Bill should say that the partnership should be treated as one person, or body. In fact, the subsection treats a partnership, for the purposes of English law, as one body, one individual, or one person. In other words, the partnership is treated almost as a body corporate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) is not present, but he would be glad to hear me say that the law of Scotland has always been far superior—as in many other respects—to the law of England in relation to partnerships. The law of Scotland has always treated a partnership as a single body, not as a collection of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the purposes of a partnership dealing with the outside world we are treating partnerships as "the" partnership. For example, a large partnership in the West End of property advisers, surveyors, Members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, honorary or otherwise, may have 20 partners, and they may own a large chunk of West End property which has been vested in them jointly, and severally, from which they operate. If that piece of land acquires development value, the partners may say "We shall make a nice profit on this. We shall sell off this property and go elsewhere." Consequently, they sell the property; and under the legislation they qualify for one £10,000 exemption. They are treated as one body. They are not treated as 20 partners thus getting a total
	<span class='label label-info column'>818</span>
exemption of £200,000. The hon. Gentleman would like that, but it would be unfair; because, if they formed themselves into a company, as some large partnerships want to do, and sold off that land the exemption would be only £10,000. Partnerships are treated in the same way in the Bill. If there are 20 partners in a partnership—surveyors, lawyers, or accountants—they are treated as one body, and get the £10,000 exemption, as would a body corporate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That deals, I hope clearly, with the situation where a partnership sells off to the outside world any land which might have development value. We cannot agree to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that a partnership of 20 persons should get exemption of £200,000, or 10 persons £100,000. That would be far too generous. The property is jointly owned, and although there may be only four names on the title, in strict law they would all own it. Since they own it together, they get £10,000 exemption in the same way as a company or individual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Confusion has arisen because partners have dealings between each other. One partner may sell his share to another partner. In some cases that share might reflect the development value of land. This is a different situation. Clause 12(9)(	<i>a</i>) covers only a partnership dealing with the outside world, because it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"notwithstanding anything in section 30 below".</p></blockquote>
We then go on to Clause 30(	<i>a</i>)—which we shall no doubt come back to again, but I shall touch upon it now because there have been problems in the past with partnerships. Clause 30(	<i>a</i>) clearly states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any partnership dealings shall be treated dealings by the partners and not by the firm" as</p></blockquote>
Clause 30(b) states,
	<br><blockquote><p>"development land tax in respect of realised development value accruing to the partners on the disposal of an interest in land … shall, in Scotland as well as elsewhere in the United Kingdom, be charged on them separately."</p></blockquote>
That is bringing the English concept into Scottish law. In Clause 30(	<i>a</i>), "any partnership dealings" are dealings between the partners. A sale by the partners to the outside world is not a partnership dealing. I am surprised that the Law Society has made representations on this, I should have thought it would understand perfectly well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any partnership dealings are dealings between the partners, and that is treated as a separate dealing between different
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1008">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>819</span>
individuals. Each person on that dealing is treated as an individual, and receives his proper exemption of £10,000 if the dealing gives rise to a development gain. If one partner sells his share to another partner, that is treated as a partnership dealing, and the £10,000 slice applies as between them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is subject to two exceptions which I should add to make the position as clear as possible. Difficulty can arise because partners are connected persons—certainly for the capital gains tax legislation. Connected persons for that legislation are connected persons for the purposes of this Bill within Clause 5 for the benefit of preventing any avoidance as a result of the £10,000 exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Gentlemen know, if a connected person disposes of property within six years to another connected person at an under-value, the £10,000 exemption is not given. So there could be a situation where one partner disposes of his share in the partnership assets and, if the price paid for that share reflected development value of land, and the earlier transfer was at an under-value and it occurred within six years of the disposal, the £10,000 exemption would be lost, as I understand it, provided that the transfer was at an under-value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be cases where partners transfer property between each other in partnership dealings at an under-value, but there cannot be many. A partnership is a commercial arrangement and I should have thought that in most cases they do not transfer property. My advice is that if there was a transfer at under-value in these very unlikely circumstances there would be liability. The £10,000 slice would not apply. But, of course, in most of these cases that would not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further complication which I should also mention to the Committee. Again, as hon. Members know, if there is a transfer within a year, even at full value, between connected persons, the benefit of the slice exemption is not given. Let us suppose that there is a transfer between two partners of a share in the partnership reflecting development value within a year at market value. If there was an additional profit the exemption would not be given. As the one transfer would have to be at market value and then the other one within a year, it is unlikely that there would be an additional profit in those circumstances. But if there were
	<span class='label label-info column'>820</span>
such a situation, again the £10,000 slice would not be allowed—that is, in the inter-relationship between the partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subject to those two difficulties, I hope that I have got it clear and right, because this is important. The £10,000 slice would be available to each partner in partnership dealings. But if partners deal with the outside world they get one £10,000 slice for the partnership as one single body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that clarifies the matter to some extent. No doubt hon. and right hon. Gentlemen will want to ask more questions about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One question strikes me at once. Perhaps more will come to me while I am on my feet. It would have helped quite a lot if the phrase "partnership dealings" had been clarified, if it had been made perfectly clear that it meant dealings between partners. The Minister said that we ought to have known that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I said that the Law Society ought to have known it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the Law Society ought necessarily to assume that "partnership dealings" means dealings between partners. It may mean the dealings of a partnership and not necessarily dealings between partners. It would have been much clearer if that had been described as dealings between partners in Clause 30. We could then have disposed of that and considered only the dealings with the outside world under Clause 12(9).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Coming to Clause 12(9) and concerning ourselves with dealings between the partners and the outside world, is the partnership an individual separate from the individual partners? The Minister nods at that. So I assume that if the partnership has its £10,000 exemption, in a separate personal dealing quite outside the partnership an individual partner would not be deprived of any part of the £10,000 which he might be entitled to on his own personal dealings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then go on to try to work out the position if, for example, a new partner comes into a firm and the firm has already used up its £10,000 limit for that year. I suppose that he then gets no benefit out of an apportionment of any further limit. He becomes merged in the partnership as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>821</span>
an individual and is not entitled to any further apportionment of the £10,000 if the partnership again deals and comes above that limit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will be very difficult to work this out as between the partners..</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he was a partner in the following financial year, there would then be a new transaction. If there were a new transaction he could get the benefit of a share in the £10,000 exemption. But not in the first year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I was thinking of within one year. I appreciate that if the deal happens in the second year the £10,000 benefit will come into that second year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here whether there will be the sort of problems that were raised on the previous occasion when partnerships were dealt with in taxation in 1965 to which my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) has referred. It seemed on that occasion that there was a great deal to be worked out and to be left to a statement of practice which was issued only some nine or ten years later. It may well be, as my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) said, that these negotiations, these dealings, usually turn out beneficially to the taxpayer or, in the case of the Bill, the chargeable person. But one cannot guarantee that. It really is legislation outside Parliament and interpretation by the Revenue and some professional associations which will bind the rest of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will that happen in this case? I am not letting out any confidences in this, but accountants have told me that this clause is no more workable than the 1965 one. They anticipate that there will be another sort of round table conference between the professional bodies and the Inland Revenue and that after a year or two we shall get a statement of practice on this subsection. It really is not good enough for us to waste time in the Committee considering very difficult clauses and then to be told—I am not saying that the Minister has said this, but I have been told from outside—that it is no good our discussing it in Standing Committee because the clause will not work and it will have to be settled by a statement of
	<span class='label label-info column'>822</span>
practice between the professional bodies concerned. If we are to assume that this clause is as bad as the 1965 one, that is apparently what will happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to understand, but I do not profess to be as learned on these subjects as the sub-committees of the Law Society and the chartered accountants who discuss this matter with the Inland Revenue. But I am anxious, having had the example of the 1965 legislation, that we are running into the same kind of thing again and that there will be doubt as to the impact of the tax on partnerships for a very long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister comment on Amendment No. 319?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 319 relates to the same problem, so far as I can see, as to whether we treat the partnership as one body or whether we treat it as separate individuals. If we keep the distinction clear, and say that in relationship with the outside world it is one body and in the relationship between the partners each partner is treated as an individual, I do not see that the problem to which Amendment No. 319 is directed can arise, although in practice there may be some difficulties. They must be kept distinct. This may have been the problem in relation to capital gains tax, that they were not kept distinct, and we have learnt from that experience. If they are kept distinct—I may be sticking my neck out here—I do not think that we shall see the same difficulties as with the capital gains tax legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are difficulties, I think that they will probably arise, not in relation to the partnership selling or disposing of land to the outside world, which is reasonably straightforward but, as the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman appreciate, it is when it comes to the interrelationship between partners, when one partner is acquiring a larger share of the partnership or giving up some of his share. In modern partnerships there are points and percentages and a person acquires more points or percentages as he stays in a partnership for a longer period. It is in such situations that the computations and the working out of the transfers of property between partners, give rise to problems.

6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With due respect to the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West, it is not all the fault of the terrible Inland Revenue and the legislation. It is nobody's fault that a partnership can be a very complicated commercial arrangement, much more complicated than a body corporate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has seen all sorts of strange clauses and provisions in partnership deeds. They may seem strange to an outsider, but it is perfectly comprehensible to people entering into that transaction. However, a large partnership of 20 people joining and leaving the partnership from time to time is an extremely complex business arrangement. The hon. Gentleman is being a bit simplistic when he says that all this should be straightforward and simple, and that the rules should cover everything. They cannot cover every conceivable situation. One hopes that when people draw up partnership deeds, they will take the law into account, and if they are properly advised, as is happening more and more now—older partnerships might be different—some of these problems may not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Also, for capital gains tax purposes the problems are greater, because capital gains tax covers the whole field of partnership. There is the difficult problem of goodwill for instance—the disposal of goodwill between partners, Here we are concerned with the value of development land. Although there are some partnerships fortunate enought to sit on land which may have development value, we are not concerned with the same magnitude or the same kind of situation as we had with capital gains, where many assets were being disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not saying that that is an answer to the problem, but I hope that in practice, with the experience of capital gains legislation, we shall not have the same difficulty. It there are going to be difficulties, I suspect that they will be in the inter-relationship between partners, and not specifically in relation to this clause which deals the £10,000 exemption in relation to the outside world, and disposals to the outside world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think we have now gathered the principle running between Clauses 12 and 30, and that is that when the partnership deals with the outside world,
	<span class='label label-info column'>824</span>
and if there is a realised development value on land which is sold, it will get only one £10,000 allowance in one year. Each partner will be jointly and severally liable for the tax. If the partners are separately assessed, will they be allowed an apportionment of the £10,000 as an allowance against their own assessments, and when that is done will each one still remain jointly fully liable for the debts of the partnership?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Inland Revenue chooses to come down on one partner for payment of the whole of the development land tax on the realised value of the partnership property, is he to be told that he is going to have only an apportioned part of the £10,000 against that, or does he get the full £10,000 against the full liability for tax? The principle here, as I understand it, is that for the benefits the partnership will be treated as one individual—not that the partners will get benefits jointly and severally, but that the partnership will be treated as one individual. For the purpose of the payment of tax, of course, they are treated as both. The partnership can be assessed and each individual in the partnership can be liable for the full amount of the tax. True, he may have a write-over against his other partners, but the Inland Revenue can come down on one partner for the whole lot. I should like to know if that happens whether that partner is to get the full benefit and is not to be told if the benefit has been apportioned amongst his other partners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He gets the full benefit, I think, If he as a single partner is being assessed to tax in respect of the global tax the global DLT of the partnership as one body—he gets the full £10,000, because he is treated as the partnership and he is the partnership, and it follows logically from what I have said that he gets the full benefit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave the clause I have a point to raise relating to the confinement of the £10,000 exemption to a single year. In the capital transfer tax

	<span class='label label-info column'>825</span>
provisions, certain exemptions are permitted to be carried forward for one immediately subsequent year. It would have been helpful if this legislation had enabled unutilised parts of a £10,000 exemption to be used either in the first applicable year or in the year immediately succeeding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for this is not to seek an increase in the concessions from the Government, because if they are willing to give two concessions of £10,000 each in consecutive years, there is no difference in total between that and nothing in one year and £20,000 in the next. It might be a considerable convenience to companies having transactions where the effective date for the completion of the transaction was close to the end of the year. Naturally, they would try to arrange it in such a way, as the Bill stands, that they were able to take advantage of each £10,000. However, it would not be a concession in terms of amount for it to be permitted for them to carry forward merely to the next year any unutilised balance. I would be grateful if one of the Ministers would explain why it has not been arranged, within the provisions of the Bill, that such a carry forward shall be permitted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In this clause we are dealing with the problems of the £10,000 exemption limit, and the need, which the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) correctly called the essential need, for anti-avoidance legislation. We are dealing with probably the biggest potential loophole. If there are any loopholes in this Bill at all, a number of them are likely to be found in this clause. Financially we have to look at this question with some care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have dealt with a number of such provisions during the course of the debates on the amendments before the Committee. We will in a subsequent clause be dealing with inter-action between the development land tax and the CTT, and that might be a better occasion to deal with that aspect. As regards the case for the £10,000 being in each year, I think this has been a very useful concession, particularly when we bear in mind the development gains charge which we know started with £10,000, with marginal provision. We said, "Do not let us have these problems here. Let us try and simplify the tax as far as we can—
	<span class='label label-info column'>826</span>
£10,000in each year". The basis for this was fundamentally not to catch the smaller people with their small disposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a certain amount of self-interest here, but interest, too, to all Members of Parliament about the need for a simplified system—to keep down the number of civil servants, for example, and to make life easier in general for people with small disposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once we start having the opportunity of aggregating the two years, not only do we have complications, but we are on the basis of a £20,000 exemption every two years. That clearly is not the same thing. We discussed on an earlier amendment what might be a suitable small disposals limit. We adduced the arguments why we thought that should be £10,000, and I noticed with great interest the fairness of hon. Members opposite, who had a range of figures not widely different from that held by the Government in coming to their conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that £10,000 is right, and that we have been reasonably generous, while acting in accordance with the facts as we found them and the representations that were made. It echoes the point made by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) that it is not so much that deals are made between trade interests and the Government, but that the Government quite rightly have to learn a great deal about the business on which they have rather limited information. Consultation is an essential part of the process of good legislation. The Government are not just receiving information from pressure groups. They ought to be actively seeking that information which certain bodies have and which is not easily obtainable elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those points in mind, which we received and were grateful for, and which we took into account in coming to the House for the views of hon. Gentlemen, who must represent the totality of opinion, not just particular points of view, we think it right that the figure should be £10,000 and should be for the one year only.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press the point about the roll-over, in this case, of the £10,000—but a roll-over of a credit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may reminisce, when there is a date like this for a benefit, there is always a distortion of transactions in order to catch the right date. When I was an articled clerk, I recollect that when stamp
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1012">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>827</span>
duty was increased pressure was brought to bear on us to get completions done before the new stamp duty came into operation—always on 1st August. In the heat of the summer, when one was looking forward to the August holiday, as a young man I can remember tearing down the streets of Bournemouth, where I was then in practice, to get to the post office in time to stamp piles of conveyances at that very last moment before the stamp duty was increased. The result was, of course, that we made an enormous number of mistakes in trying to complete rapidly transactions which ought to have had far more consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, when there is a benefit like this, on a fictitious date, there is a distortion of the transactions. I can imagine that in this case there will be great consideration of the end of the financial year: for this £10,000 applies to the amount of tax in any financial year—not to a year as from the date the last benefit was received, nor when the last £10,000 was used up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these circumstances, I should have thought it quite reasonable to carry it over—not for ever, but even with a limit of three or four years on it one would not get enormous transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary said that the intention of fixing the figure at £10,000 and putting that in one year was to keep the benefit for small disposals. I do not see the logic in that from the tax point of view. If it is a benefit of £10,000 in one year, as my hon. Friend said, it may be another benefit of £10,000 in the next year. To put those two together in one year will not, it seems to me, either make it a large transaction or lose any tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we are discussing this matter on "clause stand part", we certainly ought to think about an amendment at a later stage. I ask the Financial Secretary, in the meantime, to consider this point. I agree with him entirely that this was the right way to give the benefit—not in the way it was given in previous taxation, on the amount of the transaction. The complication about the margins on that is considerable. But that makes it all the more important that we should allow someone who, perhaps by accident, has not been able to take the full benefit of this on 4th April and would like to take it on 6th April. One side or other of the end
	<span class='label label-info column'>828</span>
of the financial year—though I know that the line has to be drawn somewhere—may cause unnecessary hardship and distort the transactions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, therefore, that the Financial Secretary will give consideration to this matter, and I am sure that we should like to return to it again by an appropriate amendment on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>REDUCED RATE DURING INTERIM FINANCIAL YEARS</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 167, in page 19, line 4, leave out 1979 'and insert '1984'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment has a simple purpose. It is to insert in Clause 13 the date 1984 instead of 1979. The selection of 1984 is partly a joking reference to the Orwellian date, but it has partly a serious purpose. No doubt when the first suggestions were made for a transitional interim slice—a second slice up to £150,000 attracting a lower rate of tax than the top, and I would argue terminal, slice at 80 per cent.—it was hoped that there would be some possibility of carrying out the high hopes and fine words of the Minister for Planning and Local Government that the final stages of the Community Land Scheme would come about at any rate immediately after the next General Election, which he no doubt arrogantly concluded would be decided in favour of the Labour Party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the high hopes of the Labour Party are justified and that it wins the next General Election, whether it be next autumn or somewhat later. Perhaps in two and half years' time—I know not, and I dare say that the Prime Minister himself does not now know—the fact is that, even if many members of the Left wing of the Labour Party cannot recognise a financial crisis when they see one, even if they do not know the effect of a rapidly falling pound which has fallen by 10 per cent. in the last few months, even if they prefer either to vote against prospective cuts in Government expenditure or, in an even more craven way, wish to resile upon the principle of collective responsibility and sit
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1013">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>829</span>
back unable to support the unpopular measures put forward by their colleagues in the Cabinet, even they must know that there is a serious chance that the whole implementation of the Community Land Scheme will be substantially delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures of 15,000 extra civil servants and nearly £1 million a week for employing those civil servants will eventually start imprinting themselves upon the public conscience. When that happens, there will be great pressure upon the present administration to delay the date for the final implementation of the Community Land Scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will become rapidly more obvious that only by having a totally Socialist State, by having more than 60 per cent. of the gross national product taken by the State, by ensuring that even more people become civil servants than at present, can we have a situation where land is painfully, slowly, arbitrarily and unjustly extracted from the private landowner by a form of confiscation and is given, as the Left wing of the Labour Party puts it, "to the community".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final situation is where the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Roberts), my local MP, is there allocating wealth. I shall be reading his remarks, in the local paper, about his week in Parliament when I go back on Saturday and I shall hear what he has had to say about everything that has been going on. Perhaps in 10 years' time he will be allocating wealth by political criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Until that terrible day arrives we still have what is called a mixed economy, and while there is still some attempt at a free market the private landowner must be given some incentive to sell his land. Everybody understands that this sensible concession has been made for an interim period to meet that argument. Let us be a little more sensible. Let us recognise that the Socialist dream may come but that it will come a little slower. I think this is where I should introduce an odd nautical phrase, preferably of a rather clichéd nature, but it will be rather slower than we all thought. Let us recognise that and give a little stability and certainty to the land market and let us leave this interim middle slice in until 1984.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budge) moved his amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>830</span>
in characteristically moderate and reasonable terms calculated to appeal to the Minister and the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Roberts) and to make us think that a time limit must have been agreed between the usual channels for the conclusion of our discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will take account of the projections which the director of the Housebuilders' Federation has made—they have been published in 	<i>Housebuilders,</i> and the Revenue has doubtless seen them in its negotiations with the Housebuilders' Federation about the Bill—about the amount of land likely to be made available under the Community Land Scheme during the next few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not read all these figures to the Committee; because they have been published. If I remember correctly, my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Jones) referred to them on Second Reading. The projections are in the Public Expenditure White Paper of the amount of money which is likely to he spent by local authorities over the next two or three years compared with the amount of land which they are likely to buy at any reasonable degree of densities. The conclusion to which the Federation has come, and which I have not seen adequately dispelled or contradicted by ministerial sources, is that the amount of land on the market available for builders in the next few years is likely to be extremely unsatisfactory.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, and these calculations have not been effectively contradicted, it is all the more important that the Minister should be prepared to accept the amendment or write in 1982 or some date beyond 1979. Three years may seem a long time to us now, but it is not a long time in the development process. It takes three years to get planning permission at present—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one is lucky, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) says. As I say, it takes three years to obtain planning permission, let alone getting onto the site to make a start after all the Section 40 agreements, road bonds and so on, have been completed. The three years to the development, particularly the inner urban or commercial development which my hon. Friend knows much more about than I do, is just a drop
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1014">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>831</span>
in the ocean in the time scales necessary for the bringing together of sites for the purposes of development or re-development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have made an important concession in the 66⅔ per cent. rate for three years. We are eating into that three years all the time, as time passes. It is all the more important, therefore, that the Government should be prepared to recognise that five years or more is an absolutely normal span in the development process. I should prefer there to be no date. I should prefer the rate to be 66⅔ per cent. altogether, although I should prefer it to be lower; but that would be a reasonable compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, if the Minister cannot accept the amendment, and if the Prime Minister says that there will be no election for another couple of years and sticks to that and in 1978 we are still here under the present Government, they will review the prospect all the time and, if necessary, come before Parliament with Finance Bills to extend this figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment relates to a worthwhile concession, as my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has said. It does not go as far as my right hon. and hon. Friends would like to see, but we agree that it is a move in the right direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why, oh why, having made a concession of recognition of reality—they are creeping in, we have a few in the White Paper with the red cover on transport—did the Government have to ruin it by putting in this date?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State may well tell us, as he has told us before and was right, that it is easy to change the date. Every time we have a Finance Act a minor clause will change this date. But we have also been reminded already in Committee, as my hon. Friend has just said, that a development process involving land is a long-term process and, as far as possible, one should avoid change in the rules of the game, particularly too frequent changes in the rules of the game. I do not regard the ability to change the date easily in one of our frequent—not quite monthly, as was said earlier, but perhaps quarterly—Finance Bills that we are getting used to—perhaps we shall be let off one during the peak of the summer—
	<span class='label label-info column'>832</span>
as an excuse for using the wrong date to start with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
7.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that the Minister of State will say to us that the subtle point about this date is that it is an encouragement to people to sell land for development before the more penal rate of 80 per cent. comes into effect. By the time that penal rate comes into effect, the Community Land Act will be working full swing, the local authorities will all have got into practice, have plenty of staff and will be acquiring all the land that is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As it so happens—probably this was out of order, Mr. Crawshaw—when we were about to start this debate I was reading something to do with the Community Land Act. My eye chanced upon Circular 30/76, being only the seventh of the I think 11 or 12 circulars that have already been sent round on the Community Land Act. It is also one of the shorter ones—only 39 paragraphs. Paragraph 6 of Part II of this one also has a little flash of reality, when it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Judging from experience with other enabling powers, it may well be necessary for the authority to make changes in their internal organisation and procedures"—</p></blockquote>
I think that we would all agree on that—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and perhaps to attach a greater importance than hitherto to the preparation and processing of compulsory purchase orders when allocating scarce staff resources."</p></blockquote>
Those of us who spent some happy hours discussing the Committee stage of that legislation would, I think, have found it a little surprising that this early recognition of the scarcity of staff resources in local authorities should come in when we were not given to understand that the legislation would be so difficult to implement when we were debating it in Committee. We were then given to understand by the Government that local authorities were straining at the leash, so to speak, to rush in and make use of the sweeping powers that they would have under the Act. But now we find, on studying these endless circulars, a recognition of scarce staff resources, the need to devote the limited time of staff and the limited money available to very carefully selected projects. In the Public Expenditure White Paper one sees that that Act will not produce anything significant by way of land to meet housing need, let alone any other sort of need—the need
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1015">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>833</span>
for land for industrial or commercial development, for example. It will not produce anything like a significant amount of land even towards the housing need. Yet this concession, of course, affects more than just housing. It affects development for industry, development for commerce, development for every single purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, if the Minister is telling us that this date is a subtle encouragement to get the private sector disgorging land before the public sector, through its Community Land Act powers, can take over as the all-purpose all-embracing developer, I do not think that this has any realism at all. It is clear from what is now being said, from the present situation in regard to local authority manpower, from the Public Expenditure White Paper, whether it be in limbo or anywhere else, that this date is premature. If the Minister is expecting that by moving to the higher rate of tax at this time he is moving at a time when local authorities will be so fully staffed and so experienced that they will be able to take over as the supplier of land, he is not being realistic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend said, in terms of property development this is a very short time ahead. Apart from that, is it right to put in a date to try to force people to sell at a time when the market does not require the land, or the development does not need to take place? It will not be very encouraging to try to sell housing land prematurely, because there will not be much of a demand for it. Therefore, it will not really encourage sales from that point of view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the commercial and industrial side, one has the unhappy question, following what my right hon. Friend said earlier about these deadlines. I wish that I could have seen the scene in Christchurch Road, Bournemouth or wherever it was and the rushing down to the post office with the great pile of conveyances to beat the deadline. Here we are back to the old unhappy process that, in order to get in before 31st March 1979, all sorts of industrial and commercial developments will be started, so that the deemed disposal can have taken place before that date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, of course, puts pressure upon the cash resources, the planning resources and the management resources of businesses—pressure which should not be there. Then what happens immediately after the
	<span class='label label-info column'>834</span>
deadline? If one sticks to the deadline, immediately afterwards everything dries up, because everything is brought forward to beat the deadline and then disappears. So in the construction industry there is likely to be one of these boom and bust situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that there is every argument for saying that this date is early. If the Minister said 31st March 1980, it would be more sensible. I am not particularly enamoured of 1984, even though I went to the same school as the author of that celebrated tale. Indeed, 1982 was suggested by the Housebuilders' Federation. But we definitely need a longer period in order to see how this legislation is working and to see how the Community Land Act is working—if the worst happens and we are saddled with that atrocious bureaucratic Marxist bit of legislation for as long as that. One could then determine at a more reasonable pace when, if ever, it would be appropriate to move to the higher rate. The year 1982 would be a very sensible date. Even 1981, which would give five years—a reasonable period in terms of property development—would probably command a certain amount of support on this side. But 1979, as far as I know, has commanded no support at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a number of occasions the Minister has said that he has consulted. I shall be interested to know which of the bodies that he has consulted have supported the date 1979. Which of the bodies which are concerned with the development process, with the supply of land for industry, commerce, house building or for anything else find this date a sensible date; and which do not? It would be interesting to know whether the Government's view that 1979 is the right date commands the respect and support of independent bodies and bodies outside this House. A year or two may seem terribly drastic to the Minister, but it does not seem very drastic to me, compared with the disadvantages which are implicit in this relatively early date. I ask the Minister, even at this stage, to review this date and to consider this amendment very sympathetically.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) has, in passing, made a very important point about commercial and industrial development. It may be that 1979 is adequately far ahead to encourage owners of potential
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1016">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>835</span>
development land for housing to make it available for that purpose and to be encouraged by the prospect of a higher rate of tax after that date to bring forward such land within the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I do not think that that could possibly apply to most kinds of developments relating to offices or factories. The reason for that is that the economics of constructing and financing commercial developments are entirely different from those for housing. For housing, there is a fairly rapid turnover. Normally a builder can prepare, build and sell a house within twelve months or so. If he takes longer than that, he will probably get into financial trouble. That is the cycle. It can be very much longer when there are problems of planning details and in the case of substantial buildings which are used for office or industrial purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The date 1979, which is now less than three years away, because it is 31st March, means that there is only a short period ahead during which there is any encouragement because of this temporary lower rate for land to be brought forward for industrial and commercial development. But at the moment there is virtually no development value in the sort of land on which many types of office and factory are put. That is because the capitalised value of buildings of this kind, when completed, let or occupied and sold, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) pointed out, is often lower than the building cost. That is because, with high interest rates, the capital value of such a property as an investment by a pension fund or an insurance company, or whatever body takes over the property as an investment at the end of the day, is based on a lowish multiplication of the annual rental in order to allow for the high interest charge and the cost of running it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So there has hardly been any development of factories or offices since about 1973. There may be a few cases where schemes were on the stocks, or the financing and so on was arranged with a specific tenant, and these may have gone forward. But it is beyond doubt that the normal provision of offices and factories, which has to continue at a steady pace over a period of time, has been interrupted almost totally in the past two years. It has been interrupted partly, of course, because of the crisis with property companies, secondary banks, and so on,
	<span class='label label-info column'>836</span>
a couple of years ago, but also, now for a continuing period, not for that reason, but because the arithmetic of these transactions does not make sense any longer. There is no prospect of its making sense for a year or two at least. We need a period of lower interest rates for a considerable time, coupled with a revival of commercial and industrial demand, which will mean that there will be takers for such property when it is completed, in order to establish the sort of market where this type of development can take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All our industry takes place in factories, and all our commerce takes place in offices—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And shops.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And shops. Unless we have a steady renewal and replacement in addition to this type of facility, by the end of the 1970s there will either be a large amount of obsolete and, therefore, unsuitable property in use for the revival of British industry and commerce which we all hope will take place at that time, or there will be an absolute shortage of such property, because it may be required in places where even obsolete property is not available at the moment. I am thinking of new towns or the expansion of areas which do not already have these facilities already. In such cases, there will be no means of providing the accommodation which is needed for the revival of economic activity on which the economic viability of the country depends. If we do not get it in the next three to five years, heaven knows where we shall all be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The date 1979, therefore, is far too short a distance ahead to encourage the bringing forward of commercial and industrial property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to another point which the Government should take very seriously. It is already unrealistic to have the date 1979. It is recognised by most people in the trade and the profession that it is an unrealistic date. Once that is understood and it is felt that the Government of the day will have to extend it in order to have any encouragement value in that date, the encouragement value in the date as it stands is lost. If one feels that a further concession will have to be made if one is to get anywhere, the date 1979 ceases to have the value of encouraging transactions to take place in the year or two before it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1017">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>837</span>
7.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the reasons I have given, for factories, offices and shops there is little prospect of development recovering to an adequate level during the next three years simply as a result of this concession. Certainly, we need that concession as we need many other things, as I have said. The economic revival has hardly got under way and we do not know of what strength or duration it may be. The interest rates have only just begun to come down and, as has been seen during the past week or two, they threaten to go up again. So we have not yet got even the prerequisite conditions for a recovery of industrial and commercial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that area, therefore, to put a date of 1979—which is manifestly unrealistic as a temptation to those who have such property to bring it forward before then—is only to recognise that such a concession with regard to factories and offices is not expected to have a real impact on the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that that is what the Government intend. It may be that they are primarily concerned with housing. If that is the case, they are misguided. In the next three years we should have not only enough commercial and industrial
	<span class='label label-info column'>838</span>
building to make up for the fact that there has been virtually none for the last two or three but twice as much. If we do not get it over the next couple of years, for the reasons I have given there will have been a gap for about five years—an interruption in the normal course of rehabilitation of commercial and industrial property and the provision of such facilities, which will have to be redressed thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the following five years, therefore, one will have to make up the normal production for 10 years. Yet at that stage we will be at the level of 80 per cent. taxes on all such transactions, with the threat of moving to 100 per cent. taxes. As we have already heard, there seems no prospect that the Community Land Scheme will so early be able to cope with all that is required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government would be well advised to realise that, by putting an unrealistically near date on this reduced percentage, they may completely frustrate any benefit it may have in the whole field of commercial and industrial property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
