	<div class='page-header'><h1>DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX BILL</h1></div>
	<p>8.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) for not dealing with the point he raised. I meant to, but, with all the bits of paper flying around, I picked up the wrong piece of paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about small cases and whether a person would have to inform the Revenue whether he had a right which had been injured or damaged in some way. The answer is "No". There is the basic exemption of £10,000, and if a person was within that exemption, as he would be in a small case, there is no duty upon him to inform the Revenue. So that would not apply in all small cases; a number of small cases would never be affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked what happens to the tax and whether it goes to the local authority. The answer is "No". The tax goes to Middlesbrough, so the net of tax provisions would not apply in a case like this. Compensation would be paid by the local authority to the individual, but the individual would pay the tax direct to the Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that so even in a case where a local authority immediately engages in compulsory purchase under the Community Land Act of land on which it had previously revoked the planning permission? If the hon. Gentleman wishes to think about that, so be it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a completely different situation. If a local authority is engaged in compulsory purchase it would operate a net-of-tax arrangement. But we are not considering that situation. We are considering a situation in which planning permission is revoked and the local authority pays compensation. In that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>302</span>
case, the net-of-tax operation would not apply and the tax on the compensation would go direct to Middlesbrough. Compulsory purchase covers much wider situations than the present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The circumstance I described was that the local authority revoked planning permission, perhaps because there had been a change of political control and it did not agree with the previous planning permission; it immediately proceeded to make a compulsory purchase order under the Community Land Act. In that case, would it pay net of development land tax or not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, it is very unlikely that there would be any development land tax to pay because if it made a compulsory order on land on which there was no planning permission because it had been revoked, it would probably pay the current use value. If, for some reason, it paid a value above the current use value, if, in that unlikely situation, it were to pay a development or a betterment value, it would apply the net-of-tax provisions to that part of the consideration that reflected the betterment value. But I should not have thought that there would be many such cases. The main question the hon. Gentleman asked was: what happens to the tax in these compensation cases? It goes straight to the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) implied that if he could obtain an assurance that the smaller rights involved here would not be taxable his opposition might not be as strong as he at first thought. As I said originally, I can give him that assurance. The hon. Gentleman gave an example of a motorway affecting a person's land in terms of nuisance. In that case there is no development value to be injured. If a man has a farm and a motorway is driven through that farm, depressing the current use value of the land, the farmer receives compensation for the reduction in current use value. But that is nothing to do with this legislation. It has nothing to do with development value. We are concerned here only with sums paid in lieu of, or because a person has had taken away from him, a betterment value in the land. Often the betterment value would not be in the land until planning permission had been obtained.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0732">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>303</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am reassured to hear the Minister of State's words. I suppose I cannot contribute to him the drafting of the Inland Revenue's budgetary notes, but that is certainly not what is implied there. It gives in page 10, Clause 3, part disposals, subsection (2), as examples of the sums to which this subsection applies, compensation paid for injurious affection of land, and infringement of ancient rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That implies that, irrespective of the existence of development value, those sums count as a part disposal and are assessed for development value by their nature. If the Minister of State can assure us that that is not so and that we have misunderstood it, I shall be grateful. I think I am in good company in my misunderstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to say that the hon. Gentleman misunderstands it. He read it correctly, but disposals, part disposals, compensation—anything connected with this tax—can happen only when there is development value. If there is development value, the tax bites. If there is no development value, the tax does not bite. All that is written here implies the basic assumption that there is development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is some development value in these various rights, the tax will bite. If there is no development value, there will not be any difference between current use value and market value, and there will therefore be no tax to pay. It is only when market value is higher than current use value that we have a situation of betterment tax or development land tax, as we call it in this legislation. If there is no betterment value, there is no tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned with possibly a large number of situations involving compensation where large sums might be paid by way of compensation for withdrawing planning permission. I fail to see why money that is paid by way of compensation should be treated any differently for tax purposes from money that is paid when a person sells his land and receives money in respect of a disposal of that land. They are two identical situations. At the end of the day the owner of the land has money in his pocket which reflects development value. We tax only that money which reflects development value. We do not tax anything which does not reflect development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>304</span>
I revert to the point about the development gains charge. The right hon. Gentleman asked whether this kind of situation could arise in connection with the development gains charge. The answer is "Yes". I do not hold it against him that he was a Minister in the Government that introduced that legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We did not introduce it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, he was a Minister in the Government that announced that that legislation would apply retrospectively. I do not criticise him, but if he says that was in the details of the legislation, it was not. The principle of that legislation—the development gains charge—was to incorporate the capital gains tax provisions into the development land situation. They took all the capital gains tax rules and said that if there was a charge to capital gain and that gain was a development gain, we charge it to income tax and corporation tax. Thus, by definition, he was incorporating Section 22 of the Finance Act 1965 into his legislation when he gave his consent to Lord Barber's proposals. It is not a question of the details of the legislation afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By taking the capital gains tax legislation and applying it to this situation, he was taking the rules of the capital gains tax legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the Minister would give us a reference to explain how the capital gains tax applied to gains of this sort. I concede immediately that I might well be mistaken about this and mistaken in my proposition that this is a new extension. My right hon. Friend has, as I have said on other occasions, an encyclopaedic knowledge of this matter. If he thought it was a new extension, perhaps the Minister would give as chapter and verse to explain how he is able to support his proposition that the development gains tax applied to the same situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 3 says that, when one receives a sum of compensation for damage to land, that is treated as a part disposal of the land. We are now on to part disposals. If I make a part disposal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0733">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>305</span>
of my land or a disposal, and if as a result of doing calculations it is clear that the base value of what I have disposed is less than the market value, then, if the hon. Gentleman goes back even to Clause 1—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not understand. I am talking about DGT not DLT.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. DGT is a simple case of incorporating the 1965 capital gains tax provisions. I am merely saying that a capital gain which, under the 1965 provisions would be taxed at 30 per cent. in relation to land was taxed under the new Lord Barber regime as a tax on income at surtax rates. In fact, all the capital gains tax provisions, as I understand, were incorporated into development gains charge. That is why we think it is a bad tax. It merely applies the rules of the capita] gains tax system. There are many instances of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are bringing forward this legislation because we think it is a better way of dealing with the matter. I have a large tome here. The clause refers to Section 22 of the Finance Act 1965, which was the capital gains tax legislation. Lord Barber said that in future all capital gains, when they referred to land, should be charged to income tax and surtax and he called that tax the development gains charge. All the disposal rules of capital gains tax were to apply to the development gains charge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps making political points, and I enjoy them just as much as anybody else, but I would like him to put on his legal hat for a moment and refer to the sections to satisfy us that his proposition that previous legislation applied to gains like this is correct. We do not want a lot of political backchat about its being Lord Barber's Act and all the rest. We just want to know the law on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Section 38 (3) of the Finance Act 1974 says:
	<br><q><p>"Where a chargeable gain accrues to a person on a disposal of an interest in land to which this section applies".</p></q>
A chargeable gain is defined in exactly the same way as it was defined for capital gains tax purposes:
	<br><q><p>"a sum received for compensation for damage to land for capital gains tax purposes was a chargeable gain."</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>306</span>
If it was a chargeable gain for the 1965 Act, it is a chargeable gain for the purposes of Section 38 of the Finance Act 1974. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is satisfied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me return to the main point. Suppose a developer, in the process of developing, suffers damage to his land—for instance, in building an office block there might be some mining subsidence. Having built half the office block, he could go no further because of the mining subsidence. He is a lucky fellow because he can sue the National Coal Board and get some money out of it. It is not a likely situation I admit, but it has been known to happen. His compensation will compensate him for the loss of the betterment gain or profit which would compensate him for the loss he would suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why should he not pay tax on that loss? If the subsidence had not taken place, he would have paid tax on the profit of the development as he went along. All we are saying is that the money coming from the National Coal Board or from whoever he might let the premises to is exactly the same. It is compensation for loss of profit—for loss of betterment value in this example—and he should pay betterment tax on it in the same way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister must not be allowed to get away with such absurd falsities. To say that a person who suffers subsidence on his land is to be taxed because he is paid compensation by the National Coal Board is false. It is as if one said that the man whose leg is cut off should pay tax on the compensation he receives for the loss of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He does pay tax on it. He may not under Scottish law. I have noticed during my previous incarnation when studying Scottish tax cases that often they came to very strange conclusions. But, generally, certainly under the law in England and Wales, it is perfectly clear that the man would pay tax. If someone was a famous runner, or a pianist, and his or her leg or hand was damaged, tax would be paid on any compensation received. This was the point I made originally of a trader with stock-in-trade. With a developer the land might be his stock-in-trade. In that case he is taxed under the present law. If a developer has land which is stock-in-trade—I am not saying that all developers have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0734">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>307</span>
—he pays tax now on compensation in respect of damage to that land. It comes into his trading account in the same way as if he had sold his stock-in-trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The law will be the same under this legislation as it was before. The only difference in this case is that we charge that compensation, if it reflects betterment or development value, to development land tax. That is the only difference we are making. If there is no increase in current use value, or if there is no development value, there is no development gains charge. That is all we are doing. We are doing nothing different from what is being done generally under the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
8.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having given the hon. Member for Hove the assurance that we are not seeking to tax here—in fact, we cannot—merely current use values, but are concerned only with development value, because we consider it right that if a person receives compensation for development value he should be taxed in the same way as if he realised that value and secured the money by sale, I hope that he and his hon. Friends will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue the Minister on Gourlay's case on the question of damages—usually recognised as the most unfair case ever decided by the courts, now before the Pearson Commission on the question of compensation for personal injuries and damages payable for them—because I do not think it is a correct simile to draw with this case. After all, what development value is there in a leg? We may have it in other parts of our body, if there is no sex discrimination about this Bill, but I do not think that one necessarily applies it to this case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To whom does the money go when compensation is paid? My hon. Friend put that question to the Minister and he told him that if the money was paid to one of what I think we shall come to call the Community Land Act (Exempt Bodies)—for example, to a local authority—does the DLT deduction, as it is called in Clause 38, apply? I think the Minister said that it did not. He said
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>308</span>
that the local authority, in revoking a planning permission, for example, would pay money in compensation for that revocation in full, and the tax would then go to the Exchequer. This does not seem to fit in well with Clause 38.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If in Clause 38 we are treating this compensation as being paid for an interest in land—and that, as I understand it, is the whole principle of this—as being paid for a part disposal—and therefore a part interest—in the land, why is it that the DLT deduction under Clause 38 does not apply here? Why is it that payment will be made by the local authority in gross and the tax will then be paid to the Revenue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is easy to see the position in the case of revocation of planning permission, but there will be other cases where the local authority will be buying the sort of interest we are talking about here, particularly easements. If there is an easement going across land, a right of way where a local authority wishes to build a road, it may buy out that easement from the owner, and we are told by the Minister of State, it will then pay the full amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, particularly in the case of revocation of planning permission, there will not be quite the outcry that there would be if it were the other way round and the local authority had to make a DLT deduction. If a local authority is called upon to pay for revoking planning permission that it has given, and has to pay a sum of money representing the value of that planning permission, and then knocks 80 per cent. off it, there will be a public outcry. I cannot help how logical it may be under the Bill. It would be wholly unreasonable in the eyes of the public if a local authority paid only 20 per cent. of the compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I considered also another scenario which my right hon. Friend might consider further. Supposing that a local authority did something that it might very well do, namely, simultaneously serve a revocation order and a compulsory purchase order. What would happen then?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know. The Minister of State said that this DLT deduction applied only if it were a compulsory purchase. But I do not read that into Clause 38 and therefore it applies particularly in this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0735">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>309</span>
We have shown by our debate on this amendment our disgust with this clause and we have probably taken it as far as we can at this stage. I do not want to delay the Committee and, unless my hon. Friends want to do so, I should have thought we could come to a decision and divide on this matter. We are so annoyed with this clause as it stands and with the rejection of my hon. Friend's amendment, that I feel we must register our dislike.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it is important, when one is legislating, that one should do so on a matter of principle. I am sure that hon. Members opposite would be the first to claim and admit that they are activated in their political philosophy from principle. If the philosophy which they intend is to take what they regard as the community's share of a private development profit, that is an understandable principle. What share should be taken may be a matter of argument. That is a perfectly honourable, recognisable principle about which one might argue from different sides of the political spectrum, but it is a perfectly reasonable principle. However, I do not think the Government and hon. Members opposite should be driven into a situation which effectively destroys both the humanity and the principle of that philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we say that a person who obtains for himself an unexpected or windfall profit out of a number of factors which he does not control, just because he decided to develop his asset, that is one matter. It seems to me to be wholly contradictory of any human right or proper principle that one should say that a person who is compulsorily, unintentionally or unwillingly deprived of something he wants, should be taxed and have removed from him 80 per cent. of what it was replaced with by way of compensation. That is what I find dangerous in the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Words nowadays mean very little, I regret. However, the word "compensation" has been used very widely by the Minister in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is talking about human rights and proper principles in the matter of the levy and of taxation. But in what light does he consider his proposal for the development of family tax, where he has called for a tax on every family that has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>310</span>
more than two children? I should have thought that that was a denial of human rights and not based on proper principles. This development land tax is certainly more in compliance with human rights than the tax suggested by the hon. and learned Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought, Mr. Crawshaw, that at some point somebody would try desperately to misinterpret what I said on that matter. I am in your hands as to how far I can go, but if the hon. Gentleman had read what I said, he would have known that what I said was this. As the major human danger is the increase in population, irresponsible reproduction should have some fiscal reflection to ensure that there is some disincentive against so doing—if I may use that language. If that were done, the right and freedom of every man and woman, married or unmarried, to have as many children as they wanted would be enshrined, not restricted. But if those people who wish to breed, and breed unintentionally, are not restricted, indeed the right to have as many as one wants will have to be restricted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But let us not be mocking of human rights. It is an important matter of principle raised by the clause, because one is saying that somebody who forfeits or surrenders willingly does not go to the market place saying "How much can I sell"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am curious.

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>311</span>
argument, but I think that one wants to distinguish on this point, and it is a matter of major principle. Here we have a situation in which somebody is losing something that he wants to have and it is being replaced artificially with money—and that money is to be taxed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take the concept of planning permission for development which is cancelled. Nobody wants that to be taken away. To say that the local authority will up its price in order to buy back the tax, so to speak, is an extraordinary idea. One would have to put up the price by a quite remarkable amount, say, 800 per cent. or perhaps 8,000 per cent.—I cannot think at the moment—to get back the money, minus 80 per cent., which one would have got in the first place. It is multiplied by four. The Paymaster-General must not look so upset. Ordinarily he smiles beautifully and I cannot bear to see him looking as if he does not understand anything, because nothing that I have mentioned and nothing that we have discussed has been understood hitherto, so there is no reason for him to pretend that he is suddenly dismayed by simple arithmetic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the trouble with the Treasury—it is dismayed by simple arithmetic, and it tries to get those who are not dismayed by simple arithmetic to understand utterly un-understandable English. But it is an important matter of principle that those who have something removed from them that they do not wish to lose are being taxed on their compulsory loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Compensation means compensation. It is an attempt to put the person back into the situation in which they started. I find it most offensive to principle that it should be suggested that it is right where somebody surrenders an asset, a benefit, a way of life. It may amount to a way of life. Let us not mock the extent to which it may amount to a way of life. There are so many individual cases that it may amount to a way of life should the whole weight of the Treasury be brought to bear to tax what is, in effect, a humane attempt to replace something which hon. Members on the Government side would be the first to say should not have been replaced in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government ought to think very carefully before they apply a tax which is intended to fit into the concept of having
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>312</span>
a gin and tonic in an armchair and making a lot of money by doing nothing: the sort of standard Socialist jealousy which was promoted by the imagining of a Leader who will not be there—whoever succeeds him—much longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, as a matter of principle, that people should not be taxed on compensation. Compensation means that one is attempting to put back into the position in which they started those who never wished to move themselves from the position from which they started. In other words, it is a tax on wounding. Let the consciences of those on the Government side remember that before they support this measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not intended to intervene. But this has been a long debate where with a little assistance from the Minister we might have cleared the matter up much earlier. I speak only out of protest at all that rubbish which was talked about Lord Barber's Act. It really is rubbish. The Finance Act 1974 was the responsibility of the present administration. Every time there is a criticism of anything connected with the 1974 Act we always hear "It is Lord Barber's Act". Of course it was his idea. But it was carried through by the present administration. I was merely trying to find out whether the point that I was making, namely, that I understood that this was a new extension of principle, was a good or a bad legal point. It was a bad point. I will tell the hon. Gentleman why it was a bad point. I made absolutely plain what I was trying to say. I wanted to know whether DGT had applied to gains like this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Gentleman had referred to Section 19 of the Finance Act 1965, he would have seen that capital gains tax is chargeable on the disposal of assets. If he had looked at Section 22 he would have seen that it deals specifically with the point that we have all been making about capital

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>313</span>
sums received by way of compensation. Section 22(3)(	<i>a</i>) states:
	<br><q><p>"capital sums received by way of compensation for any kind of damage or injury to assets or for the loss, destruction or dissipation of assets or for any depreciation or risk of depreciation of an asset"</p></q>
shall be covered by the provisions of the capital gains tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman had not missed my opening remarks, he would be aware that that was the first sentence that I uttered. I said that these words were taken almost word for word from Section 22(3)(	<i>a</i>) of the capital gains tax legislation. There is a slight difference towards the end of that subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps if the hon. Gentleman had referred me to that it would have helped. Obviously, I do miss parts of the argument, and lots of other unhappy fellow citizens who have to work their way through this legislation also miss it. But it does not help the argument constantly to refer to "Lord Barber's Act". The hon. Gentleman could then perhaps have referred me, as he later kindly did, to Section 38 of the Finance Act 1974. We would then have known where we were. It is true that I made a bad point, which could have been quickly dealt with and without all the political tomfoolery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Were it not for the fact that I have sat on a number of occasions through the Committee stages of the Community Land Act and know that the dawn hour can be illuminated by wit and cogent argument, I would ascribe the course of this debate to the hour, and not to the confusion engendered by this Bill. We can draw one certain conclusion from the length and complexity of our discussions on this point, and that is that the appropriate Committee of this House should reconsider the Committee structure when it comes to Bills of this nature. I feel that perhaps we would have all got some understanding of what we were about, if we had been sitting in a different format which would have allowed the experts to speak directly to each other rather than through their mouthpieces on either side of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no misunderstanding about the strength and depth of feeling on this side of the Committee, about the way we understood, and still to some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>314</span>
extent understand, the wording of this clause. Equally, I accept that the Minister appears to be saying that we are totally wrong. I have not, I am afraid, been convinced by what he has said or by the points to which he has drawn our attention. I accept, as he says, that tax is only to be paid on a compensation payment if that compensation payment for some reason includes an element of development gain. He clearly said this two or three times.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This disturbs me. While it is a nice interpretation—and it is an interpretation of the Minister—as the Minister pointed out earlier it is a matter for the courts to interpret what the Bill says and not what Parliament intends. It is dangerous to rely on such an assurance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept what my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) has pointed out, but it is for that reason that I should like to ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to accept that, in the circumstances, the wisest course would be for us to ask leave to withdraw the amendment on the firm understanding that we will study with considerable care what the Minister has said in support of the way in which he interprets this matter. He will, hopefully, get the best advice he can from the lawyers and other experts and we will strongly reserve our position for any and all later stages of the Bill on this point which we regard as being of considerable importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a great gulf between the two sides of the Committee, not only on a matter of principle, but on a matter of understanding. Therefore the wisest course would be for us to reserve our position.

Accordingly, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn,</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a full debate on part of this clause, but we have not dealt with any amendments to the other part of the clause. There are one
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0738">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>315</span>
or two points on which I should like some further information from the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause deals with part disposals and, as I understand it, not only a part disposal of an interest, but a geographical part of the land affected by the project of material developers or the sale. Looking at paragraphs (1)(	<i>a</i>) and (1)(	<i>b</i>) one finds that the first deals with the part disposal of part of the interests of the land—not geographically part of the land—and the second deals with the splitting up of the land itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first instance is where the owner of that interest grants a lease or other interest in land out of or by virtue of his ownership of an interest. Other interests in land seems to include a great number of matters far beyond those which are mentioned in a later part of the clause. For example, I would have imagined that giving an option would be a part disposal had I not read a little beyond this clause. I do not always admit to being able to do that in a Bill, but I had reached Clause 8, which seems to take the power of the option out of the power of disposal. So, having decided that it comes well within Clause 3, if one stopped there without reading on five more clauses, one would not know that an option was taken out. I think I am right in saying that is so. Perhaps the Minister of State will confirm that when he replies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then turn over the page to lines 10 to 12 on page 4, which finish subsection (2) of Clause 3. Subsection (2) is the one that we have been debating so fully—the items of loss or damage which, if that loss or damage is paid for, the payment has to be assessed for development value and the development value has to be assessed for tax. At the end of subsection (2) it says:
	<br><q><p>"for the purposes of this Act such a part disposal shall be deemed to take place at the time at which the right to receive the sum in question accrues."</p></q>
I am not sure how one is to judge when the right to receive the sum in question accrues, the point of time at which that right arises. Is it when there is a contract for the acquiring of any of these rights? Is it when the damage occurs before, perhaps, the right to compensation has been proved? Does one have to go on and get a judgment for compensation before having a right to receive the sum? I think this will cause
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>316</span>
great problems. Since the Minister of State is so fond of referring back to the 1965 Finance Act, I have referred to it myself, and in Section 45 I find much the same sort of provision. Section 45 refers us back to Section 22(3) of the 1965 Act, which is the very section that the Minister of State was quoting to my hon. Friend as having the same provisions as are in Clause 3(2) of this Bill. That is true but they are not quite the same. There is a vital difference. Instead of this part disposal being deemed to take place at the time:
	<br><q><p>"at which the right to receive the sum in question accrues",</p></q>
in the 1965 Act it was the time when the capital sum is received as described in that subsection, that is, subsection (2). Why not in this case have the provision
	<br><q><p>"when the capital sum is received"?</p></q>
At least it would give us a specific moment at which the part disposal is deemed to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see any advantage, except perhaps from the Revenue's point of view, in making it the right to receive the sum in question. I think it is a false advantage for I think the Revenue will have a great deal of trouble pinpointing that particular time. I ask the Minister, why do we not go back to the 1965 Act from which he has quoted so many times, and use the words in that Act?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have a criticism of lines 10 to 12 which include that phrase
	<br><q><p>"the right to receive the sum in question".</p></q>
I wonder how they tie up with Clause 44 of the Bill? I am being blasé to show that I have read as far as Clause 44.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 44 deals with the time of disposal and acquisition of interests in land. The first paragraph of that clause includes the words:
	<br><q><p>"an interest in land is to be taken to be disposed of or acquired"</p></q>
for the purpose of liability to development land tax, as is set out in that clause. It goes on to set out a number of rules for judging when the disposal is deemed to take place, but those rules do not tie up with the deemed disposal of the part disposal. Perhaps I am wrong in saying "deemed disposal", because it is actual
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0739">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>317</span>
disposal as well, although the words used here are:
	<br><q><p>"such a part disposal shall be deemed to take place".</p></q>
This illustrates the confusion in the Bill. The very use of the words "deemed disposal" all the way through makes it seem an act of God. Was it Thomas a Kempis who said
	<br><q><p>"Man proposes but God disposes"?</p></q>
I suppose God disposes here when it is a deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the point on lines 10 to 12 on page 4. They do not seem to tally with the Clause 44 on pages 64 to 66.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Clause 3(4) contains two definitions. The definition is included in subsection (3). The definition of "sum"—not "some"—meaning money or money's worth, as if nobody could have guessed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under the present Government there is a difference between money and money's worth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to my hon. and learned Friend for supplementing the definition which is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I wish to make is on subsection (4). There are two definitions—one of retained interest and one of granted interest. There are something like 30 different phrases scattered throughout the Bill. If I might be nostalgic and go back to proceedings on the Community Land Act, we had something similar in the first draft of that. Fortunately, after discussion during the Committee stage, items which needed interpretation were collected into an interpretation clause in one part of the Bill. This is brought to light in Clause 3. There are two definitions which are hidden away in the clause and which occur elsewhere. There is nowhere to turn up to see where they occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even if the interpretation clause said merely that "retained interest means what it says in Clause 3", that would be some indication to the reader of the Bill. I have no doubt that this will crop up again as we progress, but having said it now, I shall try not to say it again. However, I think it wise to collect all the interpretations into one clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to follow my right hon. Friend, but not in his nostalgia regarding the Community Land Act, as I think that the word
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>318</span>
"nostalgia" implies looking back with pleasure. I have no pleasure whatever in recalling proceedings on the Community Land Act. The only pleasure I shall get is when my right hon. Friends repeal it in years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that my right hon. Friend raised the tone of the debate by talking about the imitation of Christ by Thomas à Kempis, and other such high-sounding matters of great importance. After the peaks of the last debate we return to the foothills of detail, and there are a number of particularly niggling points that I want to ask the Minister of State.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Crawford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we are being literary, nostalgia does not derive from a word meaning pleasure. It derives from a Greek word "algos" meaning pain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear it. It is a long time since I took Greek A-level. I defer to the hon. Gentleman in his superior memory. Perhaps I could say that I do know the Latin for "Imitation of Christ", but I shall not quote it because I am not allowed to. One is not supposed to use foreign languages.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the detailed points. In subsection (2), line 38, what is the need for the word "thereof"? If that word were omitted from the Bill and it read—
	<br><q><p>"a part disposal of an interest in land by the owner where any sum"</p></q>
would the Bill be any worse off? If it would not be worse off, why do we not delete it in the interests of saving public expenditure and printing costs?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point is rather more substantial. Will the hon. Gentleman say, particularly for the record, what is the meaning of the words—
	<br><q><p>"neither rent reserved under a lease"</p></q>
in lines 39 and 40? I am sure that would immediately be clear to all the lawyers in the Committee, but there are plenty of non-lawyers in the Committee and others who will read this who are not lawyers. If we can have a definition of "rent reserved under a lease", that will be very helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to subsection (3) and revert to the point which my right hon. Friend made about "money's worth". Perhaps we can have an assurance about this from the hon. Gentleman. I realise that the expression "money or money's worth" occurs frequently in statutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0740">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>319</span>
Let us suppose that a number of houses in a terrace are acquired by a local authority under a compulsory purchase order. The district valuer thinks that because the whole terrace has been acquired at once, some development value has accrued. That is a perfectly possible circumstance to have happened. There probably would not be any development value if an individual house was acquired, but there might well be development value if a whole terrace was acquired simultaneously, because of the development potential which it would allow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose also that the local authority considered that, instead of simply paying compensation and allowing people to make their own arrangements, it would re-house some of them in council houses. This also happens quite frequently. I understand that there is no statutory power for big local authorities abating compensation by the fact that they have offered a council house in lieu.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been many circulars by successive Governments saying that they should not do this, that the compensation is something laid down in statutes, and even if they rehouse people under the Housing Acts they should still pay them the full compensation. But would the use of the words "money's worth" which implies payment in truck allow for the compensation to be abated and tax therefore to be paid because a council house has been provided for the person in this case, bearing in mind that when a terrace is acquired development value may well accrue?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may be the sort of question which the Minister's advisers would want to think about. I can well understand that. He does not want to think about it, so that is good. He can tell us about it when the time comes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last, can the hon. Gentleman tell us what the last five lines of subsection (4) mean? I refer to sub-paragraph (	<i>b</i>), which cannot be said to be drafted very clearly:
	<br><q><p>"references in this Act to the granted interest apply only in the case of a disposal falling within subsection (1) above and, in such a case, are references to the interest granted as mentioned in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) or paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of that subsection."</p></q>
Is it not possible for the draftsmen to do better than that? It is not possible for them to say "There are people who will
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>320</span>
read this Bill who are not expert draftsmen, and it would be easier for them if they did not have to read through that sort of drafting", especially as the yellow, ochre, gold—whatever we call it—book is not very helpful. It simply says on page 10:
	<br><q><p>"Subsections (3) and (4) define 'sum', 'retained interest' and 'granted interest' in relation to part disposals."</p></q>
Is it possible between now and Report to see whether the drafting of paragraph (	<i>b</i>) could be made less by reference and more immediately obvious? I have raised four specific points, and I attach particular importance to the definition of rent reserved under a lease.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take up the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) when he spoke of people being dispossessed of their houses as a consequence of development getting a sum in compensation which partly reflected the development of the site and also being rehoused in a council house. It is a fair point. I accept, and the hon. Gentleman is saying, that because it is a house it may be their principal private residence, and probably will be their principal private residence if they are rehoused in a council house. There must nonetheless be some occasions when people are rehoused in a council house when the land they lose is not their principal private residence and where it may be that DLT will bite and, as part of the deal, they get a council house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept immediately that, because the land or house which is taken and which realises any DLT is most likely to be the principal private residence, this will not occur very often. But where it occurs it is grossly unfair that some people should provide themselves with an alternative house at their own expense out of the net proceeds of the sale of the land whereas other persons get a council house and not have to provide for themselves another house out of the net proceeds of sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nowadays, the right to live in a council house is a valuable right, leaving aside any subsidy which may be related to the circumstances of the individual council tenant. If a tenant now goes into a new house, the element of subsidy is something like £1,500 a year. My hon. Friend the Member for Melton has all these figures
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0741">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>321</span>
at his fingertips, and I know that if I had that figure markedly wrong he would intervene. If, for the sake of argument, somebody of about 40 gets a council house, with the present level of subsidy he may well be given a privilege having a capitalised value of as much as £50,000. It is only right that in those circumstances the giving of that great advantage to an individual should be considered as being money or money's worth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Committee will forgive me if I make a point that cannot be made too often in this place by either side. I refer to the phenomenon that, while for reasons of apparent pretended humanity and concern, the legal profession is under attack—I declare my interest as being a fringe or ex-member of it—and while the attack concentrates on the fact that lawyers are some form of parasitic imposition on people, the legislature which so criticises them passes into law legislation which is basically duplistic, incomprehensible and doubtful in meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very important matter, and not a party matter. I see the Paymaster-General nodding—I do not want to get him nodding as he was enjoying shaking his head so much when I last spoke—but a short clause such as this, which has limited purposes, is extremely difficult to understand, though, of course, not for lawyers or geniuses who have the Welsh wizadry of the Minister of State which can resolve all apparent conflict. Let us take a few of the phrases and remind ourselves, as a responsible legislating Committee, that whatever anybody imagines it is intended to mean, it can mean many things in a large number of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I plead with the Committee here. If it is simple, there will be less variance over the cases with which it is meant to deal than if one tries to anticipate them and apply the anticipated complexities to each of them.

When my hon. Friend mentioned the words
	<br><q><p>"rent reserved under a lease"</p></q>
and I said that that was not a term known to the law of Scotland, the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford) immediately said "But you

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crawford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. and learned Gentleman's insult.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I may say so, legal systems and Governments are quite different. As I point out to the Commit: tee, were it not for the fact that there is a separate legal system, the Scottish National Party would never have been conceived even though it was a virgin birth. It is important that it should not go unnoticed that there are those of us who practise under a separate legal system who care infinitely more for the soul of Scotland as it is expressed in that way, in our culture and in other ways than any member of the Scottish National Party has ever shown by the slightest interest. If the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire had been here to argue the case for the law of Scotland, I should have been more impressed than I was by a snide remark like "You believe in the United Kingdom". I do believe in the United Kingdom, and in the fact that it has given enormous benefits to Scotland. But I do not think that that is an argument against the law of Scotland.

time, the hon. Member may think it likely that I shall be banished from this place by the inevitable tartan wave which is sweeping over, which will take Cinderella Scotland out of her kitchen and place her for ever in the Ruritanian oil-fired fantasy world in which there will be no taxes and no laws, and where all men will live as long as they wish and in the manner that they wish, with as many women as they wish. It is a marvellous concept, and I am looking forward to being one of its beneficiaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crawford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you will not rule that particular comment out of order, Mr. Crawshaw, but you will be aware that there are more kilts worn at Scottish Tory Party conferences than at Scottish National Party conferences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was wondering whether this came under the definition of money or money's-worth?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that if one is wearing a kilt, the difference between money and money's-worth is difficult; there is no dividing line. If the story of the American woman who asked a soldier in Scotland what he wore under his kilt is not relevant, I am sure that you, Mr. Crawshaw, would rule both me and her out of order, because as we all know, there is nothing worn, in any sense of the word, under a kilt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is important for those of us on the Committee who are making an immensely complicated legislative Act in order to achieve a very small and simple tax. This clause, even among all the others—I shall say it again and again until everyone in the Committee wears kilts—is a bad clause because it is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>324</span>
unnecessarily complicated, for this reason. Unnecessarily intelligent men like the Paymaster-General, the Minister of State and the Financial Secretary, and all the geniuses who inevitably are members of the Labour Party, do not understand what it means. There is no justice in England or Scotland, although of course we have a genius which overwhelms all other races on earth. Who can understand it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the facts—I hope this will be approved by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire—is that when there is a United Kingdom Act which applies to Scotland, occasionally somebody nudges the funny little man in the Treasury when he is drafting it and says "Scotland"—and so we get a little section. In fact, the major sections which also apply to Scotland are couched in language which has nothing to do with, and are not known to, the law of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend brought one in such, "rent reserved under a lease". These are concepts which apply in England but not in Scotland. It is that sort of offence to our way of life which has unnecessarily given rise to the unnecessary Scottish National Party. That is one of the things which gives offence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Crawford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not the hon. and learned Gentleman agree with me, therefore, that a Bill like this would best be brought in under a Scottish Assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I would not think that, and I should be much more impressed by that intervention if the hon. Member could tell me—which he cannot—why the words I complained of did not fit into the law of Scotland. If the Scottish Office put that in, he would pass it because he would not know why it did not fit into the law of Scotland. The funny thing about the Scottish Nationalists is that they know so little about their country and, with the exception of the hon. Member, most have not been members of this sudden conversion for long because they discovered their country only recently; whereas those like myself who are compulsive, inevitable, incurably romantic Episcopalean Jacobites have been much more given to our country and its culture for much longer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I like the compliment, but I regret to say that there are compliments which come as insults depending upon their source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important when we deal with these clauses, and I make the point seriously, to remember that legislation should be brief. I seriously ask the Minister what subsection (3) (	<i>b</i>) means,
	<br><q><p>"references in this Act to the granted interest apply only in the case of a disposal falling within subsection (1) above"—</p></q>
it would not be anywhere else, so we can take that word out—
	<br><q><p>"and, in such a case, are references to the interest granted as mentioned in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) or paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of that subsection."</p></q>
If that is so, why have the subsection? If it is altering those subsections why not say so? One can go through this clause, sentence by sentence, and in every sentence there are words that mean nothing or, if taken in their totality, they mean either nothing or anything. That is why I object to this clause. It is not a party political matter. It is major danger to pass such legislation on the simplicity of something which is, after all, only a mathematical situation. The trouble is, generous, wise and kind as the Ministers are and much as I admire them for it, decent as they are in their replies, when they smile, nod or shake their heads, that they do not understand them either. It is a tragedy that the Committee is passing clauses that none of us understands. We should think carefully before we go any further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with most of the points that were raised.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) raised a number of drafting points. He asked what the word "thereof" meant and why it was put in the clause. Lawyers like to write "thereof". Every craftsman has his trade, and if one deprives a lawyer of his right to write the word "thereof" from time to time, he feels put out and not needed. It is a lawyer's word and the same goes for
	<br><q><p>"rent reserved under a lease"</p></q>
which I always assumed was a rent but somewhere in the interstices of English
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>326</span>
feudal property law, there may be some meaning to a rent reserved under a lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure the hon. Gentleman that the parliamentary draftsmen will look at this point to see whether it is possible to simplify it and get rid of the words "reserved under a lease". The same goes for some of the other wording the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We will look at it to see whether it is possible to simplify. I take the point that he makes, and that of the hon. and learned Gentleman. We all want legislation to be less complicated and, indeed, there may be a case for looking at our legislation in general to see whether we should give more discretion to the courts, for instance, as they do in other countries, to interpret words the way they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) shakes his head. Interpretation raises a whole host of problems, especially in land law where phrases and words have acquired a certain certainty over the years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, though, there is a case for saying that some of our legislation may be drafted too narrowly—not necessarily in the tax field, but in other areas—and perhaps we should give the courts more discretion. That is by the way, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the phrase
	<br><q><p>"rent reserved under a lease"</p></q>
has no meaning in the law of Scotland, and I do not dispute what the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) said, although he admitted that he was a fringe Scots lawyer, we will consult the parliamentary draftsmen. I have no desire to do any damage to Scots laws. If it is necessary to spell out something that is understandable even to fringe Scots lawyers we shall do our best to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to a point relating to compensation for loss of a house. I think the hon. Gentleman practically answered the point. If one received compensation and that compensation reflected some development value in one's principal residence—since the disposal of a principal residence which includes development value is not chargeable under this legislation—there is no tax charge any way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point was in relation to the definition of the word "sum" in money
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0744">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>327</span>
or money's worth. If a person is given a house, a horse, an aeroplane or any other asset instead of money as compensation and if that reflected development value it is taxable as if he had received money or money's worth. This is why the definition is included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was interested in the nervousness that gave rise to this definition. Why, if that is what is meant, did they not just say "value" instead of "sum" and then "money" and "money's worth"? Why not, if "sum" means money or money's worth, include horses or whatever it is? It is a very clumsy way of putting it, is it not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One could not use the word "sum" and merely say money or money's worth. But if one uses the word "sum"—and it is used throughout our tax legislation, not just in this Bill—it is sometimes easier and better to use the same word. At least people have some idea of what is meant. If one starts to invent new words it creates more problems. The word "sum" is used, and it is found necessary to define it because in the past there has been some dispute as to whether money's worth is "sum".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why should not the word "value" be used? Read the clause and use the word "value". Surely that would solve the problem. To say that "sum" is a technical word in law seems to be false.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One does not receive value. Value is not an asset of any sort. Something might have a value. If the hon. Gentleman wishes us to consider this point we will consider it. I have no objection to using another word.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to two points raised by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). First, there was the question of options. He answered his own query. Options are not interests in land and included for these purposes. There is no question of a tax charge in relation to an option. The second point relates to the time in which tax would be payable in relation to compensation. He rightly pointed out that in this legislation the disposal takes place when the right to receive the sum arises. That is different from the capital
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>328</span>
gains legislation. In that case it is when the sum is received. I accept what the right hon. Gentleman says. There could be great difficulty if, in the present legislation, we leave it as a right to receive money. In these cases it is difficult to know when the right will arise. If it is a question of suing the National Coal Board, does the right arise immediately? Does it arise when counsel gives his opinion and says "Yes, you can go ahead and sue", or does it arise only when the court decides? I can foresee great difficulties, and I accept entirely what the right hon. Gentleman says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision was put in in case the land is sold or transferred in the interim between the right arising and the money being received. There might be some difficulty there. But we will look at it again. It is not satisfactory, and we will try to clarify it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, land law is complicated and taxation is complicated. It is an area where one meets uncertainty and one tries to use phrases that have been used before and upon which the courts have pronounced. We will try to make the drafting simpler. The parliamentary draftsman is a very hardworking and diligent person and he works under great stress. I am sure everybody would agree that, in the end, he does an excellent job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to come back to the point I raised which had not occurred to me before my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) raised it. In enunciating the argument, however, I very much narrowed the scope of the problem. The problem still exists. It is true that in most instances where a council house is provided as part of a deal it is usually done where a principal private residence is taken in some form of compulsory purchase scheme, and, as the Minister of State said, in those circumstances no DLT is payable anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But there are other instances where, for example, a person is living in a shop and therefore the land taken is partly a principal private residence and partly business premises. Or, again, one can think of a situation where a person might have a house somewhere which was unsuitable for them and another piece of land somewhere else, and, as part of the deal by which they received compensation for the other piece of land, that person
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0745">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>329</span>
might say "Let me sell my principal private residence. You provide me with a council house as part of the deal by which I receive compensation for my bit of land which you are going to take and on which I see DLT is payable".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not in the days when council housing was provided for a tiny section of the community who were thought of as being very poor and therefore in need of not very good housing. A very large number of our fellow citizens now live in extremely comfortable, heavily-subsidised council houses. This is a serious point where a real injustice could be done as between persons who sell land without receiving a council house as part of the deal and those who do receive a council house as part of the deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not pretend for a moment that this is a situation which is likely to give rise to a large number of anomalies, but the fact is that the people of this country now realise that possession of a council house is a very great privilege. If I am right and this sort of situation does arise in future, it will create very great resentment among those who find themselves paying DLT
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>330</span>
without the set-off of a subsidised house as opposed to those who take a subsidised house as part payment towards their betterment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept immediately that one cannot consider the extent of this possibility at seven minutes to ten o'clock when the possibility has only just been presented, so I am not asking the Minister to make any promise now. But there is a possibility here. It may not occur very often but it may occur, and we must recognise that a council house is one of the greatest privileges that the State can confer on a citizen now. This is a matter which, in fairness and equity, the Minister ought to consider.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
