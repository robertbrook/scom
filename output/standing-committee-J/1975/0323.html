	<p>[MR. ALAN FITCH 	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='page-header'><h1>DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX BILL</h1></div>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster-General (Mr. Edmund Dell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That during the proceedings on the Development Land Tax Bill the Committee do meet on Thursday next at half-past Ten o'clock, and thereafter on Tuesdays at half-past Ten o'clock, Wednesdays at half-past Four o'clock and Thursdays at half-past Ten and half-past Four o'clock.</p></blockquote>
It is a very great pleasure to us Mr. Fitch, to be serving under your chairmanship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The motion means that this week we shall simply sit on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. This will give everyone an opportunity to prepare for the later and more intensive debates. From next week, we intend to meet on Tuesday morning, Wednesday afternoon and evening and Thursday morning, afternoon and evening, starting at half-past Four to give time for hon. Members to attend any statements in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that, depending on the progress of the Bill, it would be our intention, on days when we meet in the evening, to sit while the House is itself sitting. I hope that we shall be able to get through the Bill in due time, without any of the more extreme sittings in which Committees occasionally have to indulge. I have explained to the House when we need the Bill, and I think we shall have plenty of time to give real consideration to a complex piece of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
Perhaps I might refer to the somewhat large room in which we find ourselves. I do not know how it appears to other members of the Committee, but we seem to be huddled up here in rather a small corner of a very large barn, and it might be preferred by the Committee if it were possible to find a smaller room in which to meet. It might actually help with the intimacy of our proceedings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure about the intimacy of the proceedings, but I certainly join the right hon. Gentleman in expressing our pleasure at sitting under your chairmanship, Mr. Fitch, I always think that on a Sittings motion the Chairman ought to be allowed to join in, because he is most concerned with the length and time of sittings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I give a little warning, and ask for some assurances from the right hon. Gentleman on this question? He has kindly said that during this week we shall be sitting only in the mornings of Tuesday and Thursday, and that gives us some time to catch up with the preparations for amendments. But when we get to next week, we shall be devoting almost our whole time to the Bill by sitting on three days of the week, and open-ended on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite agreeable to that to start with, but we shall have to see how we proceed, and if I have to protest that we are going a little too fast, I hope you, Mr. Fitch, will accept that protest. It is of advantage not only to the Opposition but to the Government, that the Opposition should have time to prepare proper amendments. The alternative is that we have long debates on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
"clause stand part." I assure you that we shall keep in order, but on each clause there are so many points which it is unsatisfactory to raise on "clause stand part" without having given warning of them by amendments. My only fear is that we might go a little too fast for us to get the amendments down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that connection, the Government are in the happy position of merely having to read the briefs of their very efficient civil servants, and, indeed, of having a group of civil servants right at hand, whereas the Opposition has to take advice from its voluntary civil servants, if I may put it that way—and I can assure the right hon. Gentleman and yourself and the Committee that the number of voluntary civil servants we have on this Bill is tremendous. We have an enormous amount of advice to sift through and to turn into amendments, and we need time to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the right hon. Gentleman in saying that we need the right amount of space to act upon the advice which we are getting. He has his civil servants only a yard or so from his left hand, but I am afraid that if we continue in this room we shall be running up and down in order to obtain advice as the debates go on, and it would be a great help to the Opposition to have a smaller room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reverting to the point of getting amendments on the Order Paper, instead of discussing matters rather vaguely on "clause stand part", if we make the kind of progress which the right hon. Gentleman wants, it may well be that a considerable amount is left for Report stage. While we have been in Opposition we have found on many occasions, on Finance Bills and Bills on financial matters, that a great number of undertakings are given in Committee at least to look at matters, and then we are suddenly rushed through the Report stage after Ten o'clock at night, which is not good enough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give warning here and now that if we are co-operative on the Committee stage, in specifying the points on which we are pleading for amendments and being clear about it, we should be given time on Report to pursue assurances and undertakings given in Committee. It is most unsatisfactory when an Opposition have been co-operating in Committee to find that their time is shortened on Report. We have a large number of pages to get through in this Bill, and I think it right to give that kind of
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
warning right at the outset.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no intention of any deliberate obstruction of the Bill, but there will be a lot to debate on it, both major and minor points, which perhaps concern, in particular, the professional people who will have to administer the Bill for the private individual. So with that warning, and in the hope that the right hon. Gentleman can give me a little assurance on what I have been saying, I shall not advise my hon. Friends to vote against this motion, but we may have to consider later how matters are going.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for saying that no deliberate obstruction of the Bill is intended. I deduced that that would be the position from the fact that the Opposition did not vote against it on Second Reading, but voted on an amendment which they had put down. I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that, of course, we shall be only too prepared to consider amendments and will try to ensure that the Opposition have proper time to prepare and put them down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely agree that it is very much better if there are specific amendments on the Order Paper, rather than that a large number of matters should be raised on "clause stand part". If the right hon. Gentleman finds that we are going too fast, then he will no doubt tell me, and we can consider the position in the light of that, and in the light of progress on the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman will not expect me to say anything about the Report stage now. Obviously, I cannot allocate time on the Floor of the House. All I can do is assure him that I will do what I can to ensure that there is reasonable time for the Report stage. I am sure that we can proceed with the Bill in a spirit of understanding of each other's problems, and I hope that in the light of those remarks the Committee will accept the motion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 2 follows the theme of Amendment No. 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is perhaps an appetiser rather than anything else, on the problem of when the tax is to be paid. The Opposition would not have produced a Bill of this kind, this size and this complexity, nor a tax which is payable so early in the proceedings of development. But taking the Bill as it stands, and the kind of wording which the Government have decided to use for the imposition of this tax, we are faced with the kind of amendments which indicate the policy which we would adopt towards a tax of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come across the very first subsection of Clause 1, and find that the tax is to be charged in respect of the realisation of the development value of land, it seems to imply that the person who will eventually pay the tax is to be charged immediately upon realisation of the development. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
might seem reasonable if one read it logically, but we only have to look ahead in the Bill, even to the next clause, to see what realisation of the development value means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, it does not mean realisation at all when one has a deemed disposal; it is merely deemed realisation. So we have been looking at the point as to when the payment shall occur, and also when the tax shall be assessed, and if it were possible that the tax could be assessed at the very early stage of contemplation of development, but not be payable until the development value was realised—as everyone would understand the word "realised"—it would not be such an unsatisfactory tax. By Amendment No. 1, we are asking the right hon. Gentleman whether he will agree to the tax being assessed at the outset of development. The person concerned in the development should know his liability at an early stage, but should not have to meet it before he has received any proceeds of the realisation of the development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax is a capital levy to be paid before any capital has been received. It is a levy on an anticipated profit when there is a deemed disposal. I have no objection to the tax being paid when money is passed on the sale, but when there is a deemed disposal and no money has passed, it is grossly unfair on the developer that he should pay the tax out of his own pocket or out of borrowings. We have also to consider how much a developer would pay in interest on any borrowings to pay the tax or how much he is losing by keeping his own money idle by way of a payment to the Exchequer, for the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 2 provides that payment should be made when a developer actually receives the proceeds from a realisation. It may be said that this would not cover the Harry Hyams position, when a project of material development is completed and, in order to obtain something out of inflation if it continues in respect of buildings as it has in the past, the owner retains the development. Perhaps we should not have an amendment like No. 2 which provides for the tax to be paid out of proceeds. Perhaps the tax should be paid on the completion of the project of material development so that one avoids a Harry Hyams situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point of Amendment No. 2 is that a developer should be allowed to carry out his development without interruption to his
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
cash flow by having to pay out this tax. I appreciate that later in the Bill developers are given a year of grace, and that the tax can then be paid in instalments, but it often takes much longer than one year to carry out a development and, during that time, there will be a continual drain on the builder's cash resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A developer may also have to give bonds for road developments and the provision of water and other services to an estate. He has to meet heavy expenses before seeing the proceeds of a development, and if the tax is added to the normal outlay, it will deter many developers. In many cases it will tip consideration over the margin when developers are working out whether a development is worthwhile. If that happens, the so-called development land tax will not result in the development of land. I am sure we wish to make progress on this matter. This is a reasonable tax on windfall profits, but it should not delay development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I start by declaring an interest which I hope, once declared, can stay on the record so that progress will not be delayed. I am a director and substantial shareholder of companies whose land will be directly affected by the provisions of this Bill. I am also a farmer whose land, I hope, will never be affected by the Bill and I am a non-professional associate of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, whose observations I hope to hear a great deal throughout our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) mentioned Mr. Harry Hyams and it seems that every time we debate legislation affecting land, the fortunate or unfortunate Mr. Hyams inevitably figures in our discussion. I fear he is often misreported or misrepresented. I seldom disagree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, but I felt he was almost lending credence to the widely-held illusion that buildings become more valuable because they are held empty. Buildings of a particular class can become more valuable because there is increasing demand for them, but they increase in value whether they are let, owner-occupied or empty. Usually, the increase in value is greater if the building is occupied because there is an income and the building is properly maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that there has not been a great rush by the London Borough of Camden to exercise its powers of com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
pulsory purchase on Centre Point. The reason is that Centre Point cannot be let. Part of the reason for this may be the abuse which has been heaped on the building. It may also be because of the small floor size, the inadequacy of the central heating and the comparitively few lifts. But if Centre Point could have been let, it would have been and Camden Council would have exercised its compulsory purchase powers. I hope we shall not have to refer again to the illusion that the fact that a building is empty somehow increases its value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government seem to have fallen between two stools with this tax. In practice, it is a levy on the granting of planning permission for a change of use or for initial development. In those circumstances, one could logically ask for the levy to be paid on one of two occasions—either when the permission was granted or when an income flow results from the development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know if the Treasury should be regarded as having special expertise or knowledge in the property world, but the Government have fallen uneasily into saying the tax will be paid a year after the event which gives rise to the levy. This is a totally inadequate time if one is asking for the levy to be paid when income is resulting from the development. If it is the Government's intention to relate the timing of the payment to benefit from the development, they must reconsider this period of one year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, if the Government think the levy should be paid on the granting of planning permission, why wait a year? We all wish to encourage investment, and investment in land is not just carried out by developers. A great deal is done by owner-occupiers, including the entire distribution system in this country, without which there would be no point in having a manufacturing industry. An inefficient distribution industry imposes a heavy burden on manufacturing. As proposed, the tax has to be paid a year after the development, and this will impose great extra costs on wholesalers and retailers who develop premises for their own use. That may be the intention of the Government. If so, they should come clean and admit it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government wish to see a more efficient distribution system, they should ensure that the levy is payable only when there is some benefit from the development. Improvements in the physical distribution system are most likely to result from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
work of owner-occupiers. We are unlikely to see the large-scale developments which characterised the 1960s and early 1970s. Interest rates and confidence are among the factors against such developments. However, owner-occupiers will be discouraged by the timing of this tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a director of a company called Kings Reach Investment. If hon. Members looked out of the window on the other side of this room, they could see the Kings Reach site, where a development which includes 198 flats has just been completed. It has taken about five years and I hope it has benefited the community. I think it is quite good-looking. However, if the owners, when assessing the possibility of carrying out this development, had thought they would have to pay the tax after only a year—four years before any benefits would flow—it is likely that there would have been no development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the development includes offices, shops, and an hotel. We may have differing views about the benefits of this type of development, but if extra unnecessary burdens are imposed at an early stage of development, before there is any income, the result is likely to be no development. Perhaps the Paymaster-General could tell us why he has chosen the period of one year? Why not two years, five years or six months? What is so magical about one year? It is neither the time of the event giving rise to the levy nor the time of benefit arising from it. I hope that the Government will consider this matter in the light of our representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased to be sitting in a Committee under your chairmanship, Mr. Fitch. The last time I was in this position was when I was a member of the Committee on the Health and Safety at Work etc. Bill, which was less controversial. I support the Amendment and follow my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) in declaring an interest. I am a director of Lovell Homes Ltd, a house-building company constructing several thousand homes a year, and therefore I have a financial interest. The Amendments are germane to the house-building programme and my hon. Friend the Member for Hove is particularly 	<i>au fait</i> with the light in which house-builders see the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
House builders' cash flow comes almost entirely from sales. Unlike a general con-
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
tractor, for example, a house-builder is not in the position of obtaining an interim certificate each month from an Architect, which brings him payment on a regular basis. He relies entirely on the purchase of his houses during the course of building an estate. He needs this cash to service the loan which he has almost inevitably incurred in buying land for the development. These are continuous and ongoing costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the estate is not selling, the house-builder has one of several choices. His first choice is to sell the land to someone else, but that is an unlikely course for him to take unless he goes into liquidation. His second choice is to slow down the development. That is what normally happens. The house-builder switches his men to another estate where houses are selling more quickly. The third possibility is to reduce the price of the houses, which has been happening regularly throughout the country in the last twelve months.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In every case, there are ongoing costs which have to be met and which can only be met by purchasers visiting the estate, looking round a showhouse, and finally signing a contract. If, in the middle of this exercise, the house-builder has to incur a heavy new charge, such as this tax, his whole project might become inviable. In our view, it is wrong that a tax should have to be paid in respect of an event which has not been completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the provisions in the schedules are better than nothing we believe that the right time to pay is when some benefit has come from the development. Even though there is a right to pay by instalments, the tax has to be paid within twelve months. For estate development, that period is too short. In some cases, properties might be sold within twelve months. Sometimes they can be sold within one month, and in that situation a house-builder would be in a better position to meet the charge when the market is strong. At present, the market is patchy. At the lower end, house-builders are selling cheaper houses quite well, but in the middle to upper part of the market a different position obtains, and they are in a less favourable position to pay the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically at this matter. I assume that it is not the Government's intention to introduce measures that will have an adverse affect on house-building. I was a director of a house-building association before I became a Member of the House. Although I have not seen any papers that I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0574">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
was not entitled to see, I am reasonably 	<i>au fait</i> with the discussions which have been going on in a general but not a detailed way. I assume that the Government are taking a constructive attitude, and I hope the amendment will be accepted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said that the two amendments were fairly general and that they related to the general way in which tax is charged. He said they were not specifically related to the deemed disposal which occurs at the start of material development, although that situation was dealt with in the amendment. The amendments go further than the question which has been raised and whether some tax should not be payable at the time of a deemed disposal time. The amendments provide that tax should not be paid until some benefit has been received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) and Melton, (Mr. Latham) concentrated on the deemed disposal at the start of material development. We shall come back to that matter when we discuss Clause 2, which deals with it more specifically, and I hope that the Committee will not mind if I do not go into it in detail now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Crosby, by implication, showed the difficulty that one would be in, and the difficulty for the taxing authority, if the amendments were accepted. He said that the amendments implied that liability should not occur until payment has been received. He mentioned Mr. Harry Hyams but I will not pursue that matter. The right hon. Gentleman said that liability might arise on completion of the development. That is a different situation. One then has to ask when completion will take place, because it may be easy to delay it and there might, therefore, be scope for avoidance and delaying payment. His remarks show the difficulties involved in accepting the amendment within our present tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, our present system does not provide that tax shall not be payable until taxable money has been received. That would be simple and appears to be a fair doctrine, but it is not the case in our tax system. Tax is often levied before the money is received. For example, a trader's tax bill is not computed on actual cash receipts. There are some people, such as
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
members of the Bar and actors, who are in the favourable position of not having to pay money in tax until they are paid. But that is not the general situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is more general that, when a chargeable event occurs, after time for appeals and assessment, tax is paid. Otherwise, cheques would lie in drawers, money would be withheld, perhaps for years, and tax would not be paid until cheques were received and in one's bank account. We cannot have that situation, and that is why tax, including capital gains tax and this tax, is generally, payable when a chargeable event occurs, having given time for assessment. We are not, therefore, imposing any different rule with this tax. Developers know how to compute their corporation tax, for instance. They do not pay the tax every time they receive some money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am having difficulty in following the Minister. Is he suggesting that a company pays tax before it receives money? Surely what he means is that companies pay tax after the money has been received.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go into the general basis of computation. Most companies, be they building companies, those producing motor cars or anything else, do not pay tax on the basis of cash receipts. It is payable on what is known as "the arising basis". That is the case generally, with certain limited exceptions. We are not doing anything particularly different in this case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be one significant difference between this case and the ones which the hon. Gentleman has been quoting. Clause 1(1) provides that the tax:
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act in respect of the realisation of the development value of land".</p></blockquote>
In the case of deemed disposal, it is not a realisation of development land, except in the technical sense that it is deemed to be disposed of at a price equivalent to market value. Commercial transactions in other areas, which may be chargeable for tax at a different stage, are normally taxed in relation to transactions which have taken place in practice, and not just deemed to have taken place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said the tax was subject to a deemed disposal. That is not peculiar to this tax. There are sometimes deemed disposals in income tax regulations and cor-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
poration tax. I accept the point on the narrow basis of a deemed disposal, but I am saying that there is no basic difference between the provisions of Clause 1 and the way in which tax is generally charged in our tax system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although it is true that, in general, tax is often levied at a stage when a person or company has not actually received the money, it is not necessarily a good taxation system. The most unfair example of that is the way in which a trader is required to pay VAT on bad debts. It is not good enough to point to the various anomalies and unfair examples in the system, to accept them and to pile another anomaly on to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not doing that. The amendment would introduce an anomaly. The tax system cannot operate on the basis of tax being paid only when money has been received because people might hold the tax back and money might not come to the Exchequer for many years. There will be a debate later on deemed disposals. Generally, we are not doing anything different. Developers and traders will understand that it is in accord with the way in which they usually compute their profits, and I do not think that this tax will cause them difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has thrown something of a bombshell by saying that income tax is not a tax on income but a tax on chargeable events. In certain cases, there are chargeable events which happen without the receipt of money, but this is more of an anomaly than the general rule for income tax. The Minister has said that the basis of income tax is not the receipt of money. I would have thought that the general rule is that one understands tax as being a tax on money, not a tax on something which one has not yet received. I would have thought that that meant that taxation was based on something which one received the previous year, in many cases, rather than what one was going to receive next year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always known of assessments based on receipts of the previous year. Perhaps I ought to have declared an interest as being a solicitor and, as I said on Second Reading, a director of a property company but having no personal interest in that company other than directorship. I have always understood that a self-employed person
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
pays on the previous year's assessment and that a person who is employed is paying out of his wages at that time by PAYE.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.15 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that he is a solicitor. Is he saying solicitors pay their taxes on the basis of the actual cheques they receive from their clients? If that is what he is saying, it seems that his firm has been computing tax on the wrong basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is to base his whole argument in favour of development land tax by saying that someone may put a cheque in a drawer, it really is not an argument at all. Of course someone may put cheques in drawers or may not declare his income at all. Someone may cheat in one way or another, but surely the Revenue has dealt with the cheques-in-the-drawer before now on a reasonable basis. One cannot form a new tax based on such a petty point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We make the reasonable point in the circumstances that here we have someone who is developing, who is paying out money at the outset in carrying out that development. To load that person with further expenditure on a tax before he is receiving anything from that development seems grossly unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that this was a general amendment, and that is as I intended it. I do not intend it to apply only to the deemed disposal. What about the case of purchase money payable by instalments? I hope in that case that the tax will be chargeable only upon the instalments received.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not going to stick my neck out and say I have read the schedules as carefully as I ought to, but I think the principle is somewhat recognised already in the schedules, that, in such cases, there can be deferment of the actual payment of the tax. I am sorry the Minister has been so obstinate over this because it is a vital point in the whole of this Bill that we should not obstruct development by placing too great a burden on those who are really trying to carry out what the whole country wants—proper development, particularly in housing, although I do not exclude industrial commercial development on a proper scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this Bill is really going to be an obstruction, not only in the rate of tax but in the extraction of money out of a man who is perhaps struggling hard to carry out development, the tax is going to be most
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0576">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
unfair. I hoped for a little more appreciation of that point from the Minister, and also that we might have had some relaxation on the Bill as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before dealing with the amendments, I ought to declare two interests, firstly, as a barrister, though I do not specialise in this area of the law, and, secondly, as joint owner, with my wife, of a very small area of land which, I must remind myself, might attract planning permission in the future and as such become a charge for the development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendment No.3 would be to leave out Clause 13. It would be a paving Amendment to Amendment No.4 and Amendment No.32, which are designed to introduce a lower rate of development land tax. This would bite upon all developments which are subject to the tax, with the exception of the first exempt slice up to £10,000 or, as we would hope, a greater figure than £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I turn to the details, perhaps I ought to put forward my personal philosophy towards the development land tax, because it is plain from the speeches, both on the development gains tax, the Community Land Act and now upon the development land tax, that there is a very grave difference of emphasis and opinion amongst persons who speak about the taxation of land profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For my part, I accept that it is right that there should be an additional tax upon those values which arise from the granting of planning permission. I accept that there are considerable increases in the value of that land which arise, in my judgment, from two factors—firstly, the granting of planning permission, and, secondly, the incidence of inflation. I accept that the gravest evil of inflation is that it arbitrarily and unaccept-
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
ably redistributes wealth, and I accept that those who have the benefit of planning permission are having the benefit of holding, and later selling, the only real asset and hedge against inflation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the State takes the view that persons who lose out as a consequence of inflation should be to some extent compensated from the incidence of inflation, I suppose it is logical that, on the other side of the coin, those who benefit from the arbitrary effects of inflation, even if only temporarily, should be subject to a higher level of taxation. I do not wish to talk about unconscionable gains made by those who develop land or deal in property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish—and I make no cheap jibe about this—to attack those who speculate in land or those who make a totally spurious distinction between development and speculation. I regard speculation in land as being no worse than speculation in anything else. Indeed, I regard speculation as an important function in the market economy as a means by which troughs and increases in value are ironed out or a method by which individual people take the risk of rises and falls in value and perform, in my judgment, an essential function in a free market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But I do take the view that because the granting of planning permission is a distortion of a free market, and because also the high levels of inflation we have unhappily seen are also a distortion of the free market, there is a strong case for an additional level of taxation upon those who find increases in the value of their land as a consequence of the granting of planning permission. We should not try and blame those who develop land or speculate in land for the difficulties which our economy is going through at present. It is because we have had a persistent tendency to blame such people that we have distorted this market in land in such a damaging way over the last two and a half years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No.3 which is designed to leave out the transitional arrangements for a reduced rate for development land value up to £150,000. Of course, we are grateful for some relief, but our view is that it would be best to have a common and low level of taxation applying to all circumstances. That is because we wish to see some element of stability in this market. The development land tax is inevitably a transitional tax, even if it is levelled at a common rate on all transactions. It is a transitional tax because, if the Labour Party wins the

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
next General Election, no doubt it will wish to move towards the final and, indeed I would argue, terminal stages of the Community Land Act scheme in which all land is purchased, as Labour would put it, for the community at current use value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, the development land tax is only a transitional tax from the point of view of the Labour Party. If, on the other hand, the Tory Party wins the next General Election, it is a transitional tax because we are committed to the repeal of the Community Land Act. As I have said, I represent the consensus of the Tory Party when I say that my hon. Friends and I are almost committed to some form of additional tax on increases in the value of land which occur when planning permission is granted to that land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the way in which the land market has been pulled hither and thither over the past two and a half years, we argue that it is right to try to make this tax as simple as possible and as low as possible. We believe it is right to ensure that it bites on all transactions at the same low level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to Amendments Nos. 4 and 32. There is specific mention of the rate of 60 per cent. and a lesser rate that may be prescribed by statutory instrument. There is no magic in the rate of 60 per cent., as there is no magic in the rate of 52 per cent. which has been suggested by some important Opposition spokesmen. The prime point is that we consider 80 per cent. to be too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that 80 per cent. is too high because of our understanding of human nature. We do not say that this is a matter of any fine economic judgment. We say that no landowner will wish to sell land for development when he can retain only 20 per cent. of its development value. The Government may not like that, they may not believe in the concept of property, but that is the reality of human nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government must face the political realities. Even the Prime Minister does not want to have a one-party State, although he regards the Labour Party as the natural party of government. The reality is that the principal Opposition party has promised to repeal the Community Land Act. In the face of that reality, it must be obvious that landowners will wait to see what happens in the political arena. For that reason, they will not be prepared to release their land and to receive only 20 per cent. of its
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that 80 per cent. is too high. It is fair to ask "What do you say is the right level?" Some of my right hon. and hon. Friends have said that 52 per cent. is the right level, while others say that 60 per cent. is. However, there is no magic in either figure. We accept that there should be some level of taxation at a higher level than the rates for capital gains tax generally, but it must be a level that does not discourage landowners from making land available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a nice judgment as to the level at which landowners will be prepared to allow land to come forward. Some may take the view that landowners will want very nearly half the development value before bringing land forward. Others may say that most landowners will be satisfied with 40 per cent. of the development value. No one can prove whether 60 per cent. or 52 per cent. is the right level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, there can be no commitment by anyone in the Tory Party about the right level for the future. Such matters must depend upon a whole host of different factors—for example, the Tory Party's attitude towards corporation tax and capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a lively debate going on about whether capital gains tax should be indexed. There is a similar debate about the level of capital gains tax if there is no indexation. There is the vast imponderable of the state of the economy and the land market generally when the Tory Party returns to power. There can be no commitments about the exact level. However, 80 per cent. is far too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our assessment of human nature is that land will not be brought forward if taxation is at such a high level. We can make no commitment about what we shall regard as exactly the right level. That must depend on the circumstances in which the Tory Party returns to power. However, 80 per cent. is too high as it will dry up the land market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall leave my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) to explain to the Government what is already happening in the land market. We believe that 80 per cent. will do nothing to hit speculators, who seem to have been the hobby-horse of the Government. It will further dry up the supply of land and so prejudice industrial investment and the hopes of many who want to own their own homes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
am sorry that the Minister for Planning and Local Government is not a member of the Committee, although I have every confidence that the Paymaster-General will be able to steer us through our proceedings. I am sure that the Minister for Planning and Local Government would have welcomed the opportunity to hear the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen). It was delivered with moderation and contained a great deal of common sense. Those of us who served on the Committee which considered the Community Land Bill recognise that it was in my hon. Friend's very best style.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend made a good analysis of the problems that will result from a rate of 80 per cent. We are discussing progress towards a situation that is envisaged in Section 25 of the Community Land Act 1975. The Minister for Planning and Local Government has referred to it as the total solution. Under Section 25(2), all land will eventually change hands after the second appointed day at existing use value. The section reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of assessing compensation it shall be assumed that … planning permission would not be granted for any development either on the land or any other land".</p></blockquote>
Once the second appointed day is reached, estate development as we know it will be finished. The entrepreneur estate developer will not be able to buy land cheaply in advance of his requirements. It will be necessary for him to buy land at the price at which it is sold by the local authority. All costs will have to be passed on to the purchaser. This will have an unhappy effect on estate development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made my position clear. On Second Reading, I said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"First, the rate of taxation on planning gains by land vendors should be 60 per cent., of which half should be paid to the local authority. For builders, whose land is their stock intrade, the tax should be at corporation tax rates."</p></blockquote>
—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 1010.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a suitable amendment is tabled and selected, we shall want to consider the taxation of land that is held as stock in trade by builders. Perhaps we shall be able to do so when we reach Clause 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Committee should know the present situation in the land market. It is unfortunate that the statistics available from the Department of
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
the Environment are rather out of date. They relate to the early part of 1975. They show, for example, that there has been a substantial fall in the price of land. That is obviously desirable, as most people want to see falls in the price of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1975, the weighted average price per plot was £1,839, compared with £2,663 in 1974 and a very similar figure for 1973. The figures show that in the first half of 1975 there were 1,141 transactions reported to the Valuation Office, compared with 4,085 transactions in 1973. The transactions on which the calculations are based fell by a multiple of four in that period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In winding up on Second Reading, the Minister of State made the clear point that the situation I have described could not have anything to do directly with development land tax as the tax was not on the Statute Book. There is some truth in that argument, but people hold off land from the market because of what might happen later rather than what is happening at the present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over the past two years, with the operation of development gains tax at 83 per cent., the same level as the highest rate of income tax, a considerable amount of land has been withheld from the market. That can only have an effect on the future housing programme. That was the situation before the Government announced their concession of 66⅔ per cent. over the first three years, when under £150,000 is involved. I welcome that concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 9th January, the President of the House-builders Federation, Mr. Mitchell, wrote to the Prime Minister. I know that the letter was passed on to the Secretary of State for the Environment, and possibly it found its way to the Paymaster-General. Mr. Mitchell wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"What I would stress however is that, if the Government persists with its present intention of fixing development land tax at 80 per cent., then I am absolutely certain that the land problems we foresee will be greatly exacerbated. I would urge therefore the need for the Government to reconsider its previous decision on this matter before the Development Land Tax Bill is published, and I would suggest that 60 per cent. is the maximum rate which is likely to be compatible with the release of adequate quantities of development land."</p></blockquote>
The rate of 60 per cent. is the figure in the amendment. The Federation has made it clear that the effect of the Bill as it stands will be that many categories of land vendor—for example, farmers, who have hitherto been willing to sell land as a means of raising working capital—will find it an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0579">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
unattractive proposition to sell one or two acres, part of a garden or a paddock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) has said that a great deal of land finds its way into the market from owner-occupiers bringing forward paddocks and other small areas of land. It is the nature of things that much of the land that comes on to the market is released because of the relatively high rate of return available to landowners. To levy a rate of 80 per cent. will permanently remove many sources of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I questioned the Minister for Planning and Local Government about this matter at Question Time last Wednesday, the right hon. Gentleman referred to the Federation of House-builders having put forward a sliding scale of tax. I have the paper before me. The Federation said that gains of no more than £25,000 might be taxed at 52 per cent., gains of £25,000 to £50,000 at 60 per cent., gains of £50,000 to £75,000 at 70 per cent., gains of £75,000 to £100,000 at 75 per cent. and gains over £100,000 at 80 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the Federation's view some months ago. For all I know, it may still be its view, but it is not my view. I refer to an extract from the magazine entitled 	<i>Building Week</i> which is headed
	<br><blockquote><p>"Housebuilders report drying up of land supplies."</p></blockquote>
That is the sort of factual evidence for which Departments are always calling. When they meet trade associations or those making representations, they tell them that they must present the facts and not put forward a general grumble. So either the trade associations or the individual members of them have to prepare that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I may give a few examples of the difficulties which this magazine reports. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An alarming decline in the supply of land for housebuilding is being reported by building firms. By the end of last year land without planning permission held on option had fallen by over 40 per cent. according to one survey. If the expected 80 per cent. Development Land Tax becomes law by the summer, the Housebuilders Federation now fears that this may dry up new supplies of land completely."</p></blockquote>
For example, a spokesman of the famous company, Wates, is quoted as saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Many builders have already been reducing land banks over the past few years because of interest charges. They are now delving into stocks of only two to three years, the 'seed corn' … Wates has two years' supply and is currently building at an accelerated pace as the market for private houses is
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
in a mini boom … but, ironically, this activity is reducing land stocks."</p></blockquote>
Other companies mentioned are Gough Cooper, Barratt, Moody Construction, all companies of high reputation of whose views the right hon. Gentleman should certainly take notice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, this is within the experience of my own company, and we find ourselves in a similar position. There is a good level of building at the lower end of the market, but we have grave worries about the future, particularly as we have absolutely no confidence whatever in the ability of local government to supply us with our basic raw material in two to three years' time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that in September last year there was a survey carried out by the Department of the Environment and the House-builders Federation—I think this is the survey referred to in the extract from 	<i>Building</i> which I mentioned—stating that land without planning permission held on option had fallen by over 40 per cent. From what I gather, the survey produced some fairly alarming findings about the amount of land coming forward on a white land basis, or an option basis, and showed clearly that in several years' time the situation will be very grave indeed. If that survey is available, it ought to be published, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will tell us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has so far been no justification at all from the Government for choosing the figure of 80 per cent. The Inland Revenue statement of 4th February 1975 simply stated in paragraph 6, headed "Rate", that the rate of development land tax will initially be 80 per cent. The development land tax White Paper, published in August last year, stated in draft Clause 1(3) that the rate of development land tax would be 80 per cent. But at no stage has there been any effective justification, either from the Government in writing or from Ministers, as to why they have chosen this figure. It may be an ideological figure. It may be a figure which is designed to be a punitive rate, rather than a practical rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) indicates assent, as HANSARD would say. Mr. Irvine—I am sorry, I mean Mr. Fitch. After having served with Mr. Godman Irvine during thirty-one sittings of the Committee dealing with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0580">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
the Community Land Bill, it became a habit. But it is quite certain that in a free society we should not have punitive rates of taxation. Rates of taxation should exist for the purpose of raising revenue for the Government, and there should be no concept of punitive taxation simply because the State dislikes the activity under consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate of tax should be sufficient to deal with a practical problem, but there is a feeling among many people, which I share, that there is a difference between the gain made from a decision taken by planning authorities, and the ordinary gain made in trading. But there is no distinction made in this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their speeches on Second Reading, both the right hon. Gentleman and the Minister of State endeavoured to suggest that there was some distinction. They endeavoured to suggest that one part of the house-builder's profit should be charged to development land tax, and another part should be charged to capital gains tax. But, of course, it is not possible for the house-builder, nor is it desirable, to distinguish in any one transaction between that profit which has been made on the land and that profit which has been made on the building. So far as he is concerned, the trading profit—or, quite frequently, trading loss at the moment—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt, but my understanding is that most house-builders do not see themselves as traders in land, and, although they are quite happy to make a profit like anybody else, they are not there to make a profit from trading in land. They are there to make a profit from building good houses and selling them off. So that there is a distinction, which has been recognised for a long time among house-builders. They keep on saying that they are not traders in land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I was not explaining myself as well as I should, or perhaps as the morning wore on the hon. Gentleman's concentration wandered. Of course, house-builders are not there for trading in land. From time to time, because they have bought a site which does not work out, they sell land to the builder next door who is able to fit it into one big site. But they are really in business for developing houses. My point is that they are in business to provide accommodation, and, although there is an element of their profit which is accounted
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
for by the added value of the land, it is also to be hoped that there is an element of profit from their skill in building. What I am saying is that to divide those profits is extremely difficult and undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One does not ask a motor manufacturer to distinguish between the different elements of his profit before he is caught for corporation tax. He is not expected to say "On this car I made £100 profit by buying the steel cheaply, and another £100 by buying the rubber for the tyres cheaply." At the end of the day, he says that his profit is £X, and he is therefore liable to corporation tax at 52 per cent. That seems quite fair, and there is no reason why we should treat house-builders differently in this regard. The Government have tried to pooh-pooh this by talking about the supply of land drying up. That was to some extent overtaken by events, and the right hon. Gentleman was obviously worried about this or he would not have come forward with the 66⅔ per cent. exemption. Clearly, that was motivated by something other than liking the colour of the Opposition's eyes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, I see that the 	<i>Building Trades Journal</i> for 12th March, under the headline,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Silkin dismisses fears of development land famine", states: "Fears that the Community Land Act would slow down house-building by creating a dearth of development land were dismissed last week by John Silkin … at a meeting of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors in London."</p></blockquote>
The reason given for dismissing it was that by 1979–80 a large amount of land would be provided by local authorities. I have the greatest respect for the Minister for Planning and Local Government, although I do not agree with his policies. But we are great friends and always had good contacts in the Committee on the Community Land Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not think it is unreasonable to like the right hon. Gentleman. But I am absolutely certain that, if I had to decide between the judgment of the right hon. Gentleman on the question of the land market and whether or not house-builders will get any land, and the judgment of the House-builders Federation and their members, I should prefer to listen to the builders because they have to build the houses, whereas the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has quite rightly referred to the house-builder's problem. But is not it a matter for regret that the Minister for Planning and Local Government is not with us in this Committee, because his Department is answerable for the supply of land for development and, unfortunately, the Treasury are not? Is it perhaps an explanation of why we are having to table this amendment, that the Treasury do not have any responsibility for the supply of land and perhaps are not concerned about it or aware of the problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a great deal in that. Again, I am sorry to appear in any way too friendly with hon. Gentlemen opposite. I have great confidence in the ability of the Minister of State to shepherd us through our proceedings, even if in due course he will have to shepherd us all night. But I entirely agree with my hon. Friend that it would be desirable to have opposite us specialist expertise on the land availability side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I just do not think that the right hon. Gentleman has any basis for pooh-poohing the idea of development land planning. It is the considered view of the industry that this will happen, and it is very worried. We have many years' experience of working harmoniously, and inharmoniously with local government over planning applications, and one thing of which I am certain is that local government moves slowly and does not move entrepreneurially. The training of local government officers is not meant to produce good entrepreneurs digging land in the fields, to see what can be brought forward for development. That is a wholly different skill, and the idea that the borough valuer of a town will be as good at finding land and bringing it on to the market as the land negotiator of a development company, who is working on a commission basis, is wholly out of relationship with what happens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible for the right hon. Gentleman to make a concession. After all, he has already made one. A few months ago, the rate was to be 80 per cent., but it is now to be 66⅔ per cent. for three years. I believe that that is not enough, and it is absolutely essential to settle this matter once and for all. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen)
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
was quite right in saying that the Opposition could not possibly give any pledges on rates of tax, and it would be ludicrous to do so. But hon. Members on this side can give a general undertaking of their thinking. We have indicated that a rate of 66⅔ per cent. is reasonably acceptable to us, and surely, in the interest of settling this matter, the right hon. Gentleman could meet us in this regard and then we might not have this problem arising every two or three years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jack Dunnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may first declare an interest, following the precedent of the right Hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). I am a solicitor but do not practise very much, although I have a great interest in development matters. I am interested in a property company which has never developed, but there is always a possibility that it might. I am also interested in a company which advances money to developers. So I declare my interest in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened very carefully to the arguments of the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), I would say that it is very true that all taxes are a deterrent. There is a strong case for saying that corporation tax at 52 per cent. will induce many traders not to trade, because they are left with only 48 per cent. Coming a little nearer home, one might say that practising solicitors would cease to practise after Two o'clock every day, or after January or February of each year, because they are paying 83 per cent. at their top rate. Over the years, the disadvantage which taxation theoretically brings to enterprise appears to be mitigated by the desire to carry on working regardless of the tax rate. A tax rate of 80 per cent. is a most enormous deterrent, but not as great as a rate of 83 per cent. on normal earned income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The great justification for a tax of this size is that, without the planning permission given by the community, land would not have such a value. One has only to think of the difference in the value of prime agricultural land and the value of the same land when used for building houses to know that, unless planning permission is given, there is no question of any tax being paid. In my small experience of dealing with land developers, I know they draw a distinction in their accounting computations between the value of the land bank at the time of the development and the value of the development from the point of commencement to the point of sale.

12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many development companies which originally relied entirely on development profits found, during the boom years of the late 1960s and early 1970s, that land yielded far more on its own than the part attributable to development. I am not saying these companies bought land to make a huge gain simply by holding on to it, but the value of land increased so greatly that its potential profit, even if sold before development, was far greater than any profit which could be made on a development and contracting basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This caused considerable resentment. Most people believe that if someone has worked on a project, for example, a person who develops land, he is entitled to a profit, but where someone has land worth £X which, after nothing more than the granting of planning permission, becomes worth £20X or £30X it should be taxed at a higher rate, especially as this gain is achieved because of the needs of the community and general inflation. It is the purpose of this measure to remove a large part of the gain which results from planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot speak about the relationship between land availability and this Bill, but at present, subject to purchasers being available for the end product, there is enough land for current development. The position in two or three years is a matter of surmise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct. There is plenty of land on the market, much of it from receivers and companies that have gone out of business, but the problem is for the future. Land, particularly that with planning permission, is not coming on to the market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dunnett</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I take that point, but it is impossible to say what the decision will be in three or four years' time, though I accept that the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) is in a better position than I to make an assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the argument that all taxes are a deterrent is extended far enough, many organisations would go out of business until a change of Government or a change of heart by an existing Government resulted in the tax being reduced. I do not think the supply of land will dry up, but that argument has no validity anyway when compared with the main argument that it is only because of a community planning decision that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
land has any value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is said that the tax is wrong because it will keep development land off the market, this would involve a profound change and great relaxations in our planning structure. If the community decides that land is to be developed, it is only fair and moral that the community takes the bulk of the gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter of political philosophy. We believe that if the community makes it possible for a gain to be made with no more work than the submission of a planning application—which involves only some interim work—this should not be taxed at a low rate. I know the Opposition take a contrary view. I think they are overstating their case when they claim that the supply of land will dry up. Only time will tell.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The possibility of land drying up is decreased by the concessions in Clause 13, which provide a rate of tax for small parcels of land almost as low as that proposed in the amendment. The high rate will apply only to large parcels and I think the lower rate of 66⅔ per cent. will ensure sufficient supplies of land in smaller parcels coming on to the market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a community decision makes land available for development, we think the gain should be subject to the appropriate rate of tax. The other half of the argument is that this tax will cause the supply of land to run out. In that case, we shall have to deal with the matter through the Community Land Act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"They want merely to reduce substantially the tax on these windfall gains, from 83 per cent. to 52 per cent. We believe that that is not acceptable to the majority of the British people."—OFFICIAL REPORT, 26th February 1976; Vol. 906, c. 536.</p></blockquote>
He seemed to be implying that our suggestion to reduce the tax to 52 per cent. was not credible and, almost, was not important. It is not only credible, it is most important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Surely we must all be concerned that there is an adequate supply of land for development. The hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) shared that concern and rested his opposition to the amendment partly on the ground that taxes exist, yet trade goes on and people earn money and therefore taxes cannot be a deterrent. Companies continue trading and trying, vainly in many cases, to make a profit of which the Treasury will snatch back about 52 per cent. For some time, the Treasury snatched back 52 per cent. of an illusory profit because of our accounting methods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course companies go on trading—that is what they are in business for—and of course people go on working despite the rates of taxation, although we are all reminded by the current rate of taxation and levels of benefit that the majority of the British people would find it more beneficial not to work for about 14 weeks a year and to rely on the State to keep them. If there is a greater deterrent to enterprise and effort than that, I would be interested to hear it. If the Treasury does not turn its mind to this situation in the near future, something will have to be done in another way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People and companies do not like the levels of taxation, but they go on. That does not apply to land. Land is rather like a mineral resource. If the reward for making it available for use is not high enough, it will not be brought forward. The Paymaster-General is more skilled than I on the subtleties and implications of the petroleum revenue tax, but I am sure he is aware that, at certain rates of tax, natural gas and oil would remain unexploited. At certain tax rates, it will not be attractive to bring land into use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities could become the sole developers and I do not know what evidence the hon. Member for Nottingham, East has for believing in the all-seeing wisdom of local authorities in development matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon.

Surely there should be a heavy tax on land which at one moment is worth £1,000 and suddenly becomes worth £101,000.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is the key point. The answer is that it would be less bureaucratic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recall attending a conference on land at which were present all the best known names from the development and academic worlds, the professions, leaders of the new towns and extended towns and representatives of the major politicial parties. I was moved to say that if one saw a piece of land which had been undeveloped for ten years one could bet one's bottom dollar that it was owned by the Department of the Environment or a local authority. The only voice of dissent was an apologetic one from the Property Services Agency, who asked: "What about British Rail?" I agree that British Rail land habitually lies unused for many years. The Bill as it stands will lead to delay. Delay means money and, more important, less houses, less jobs and less everything for the community—if I may be allowed to use a word of which hon. Members opposite are so fond.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that 80 per cent. is the wrong rate. It can only be defended on the assumption that the Community Land Act is the answer—with its procedures for accelerated compulsory purchase and reducing the rights of the individual to object to the compulsory purchase of their land or land in which they have an interest. Only if one believes that these procedures are the way in which land must be provided can one support this rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) has said that the Public Expenditure White Paper should be regarded as being in limbo. I do not think that the Paymaster-General will accept that, but the White Paper makes clear that, in the next few years at least, the Community Land Act procedures will provide very little indeed of the land that will be needed for all development purposes. If hon. Members opposite wish that it were otherwise, that is
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
defensible, but they will have to persuade the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the necessary resources should be provided. Even for the miserly amount of land which it is expected will be brought forward that will be expensive. A total of £313 million net will be required for expenditure on land, and that figure does not include administrative costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say to those who believe that the rate of tax is right, that the Community Land Act is a fallible instrument. Apart from our philosophical view that the Act is a nationalisation measure, it is not a measure on which we can rely to supply land for development. It is expected that restraints on the manpower and money of local authorities will affect the working of the Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When exercising their Community Land Act powers, local authorities will look at the easy land—the green belts at the edge of built-up areas. They should be looking at twilight areas, the inner zones with multi-storey warehouses which are no longer used. But local authorities will not look at such land because it requires more skill and time, and because the difference in value between the current use value and the value for redevelopment, perhaps for offices, will be not so great. Because it is not great—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What will be the attraction to the property developer of developing such areas?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unless the Government accepts the amendment there will be small attraction. If there is an amount of development land on which a profit can be made, developers will come forward with suggestions for schemes. The process of urban redevelopment involves a series of negotiations between the developer, who has identified an area of land with possibilities—it could be one of mixed houses, offices and housing over shops—and the local authority. The developer does some calculations and talks to the local authorities. There is much discussion. The local authority will initially ask for the moon but eventually settle for some minor satellite.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The end result is usually a development with the physical facilities which the community needs. It produces a profit for the developer when there is a change of use. The change of use will attract tax and the benefit of that change of use will be a critical factor in the financial stack-up which leads to development taking place. If
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
there is no benefit, the developer will not bring his skill to the matter and nor will local authorities because of the extra work and skill involved. That sort of land requires the most work. Local authorities will look instead at the next piece of green belt for development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a substantial difference in value between the best piece of agricultural land and that same land with permission for housing development. It is that difference in value which leads to public pressure for a high rate of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The price we will have to pay for the high rate of tax in the Bill is the price of stopping development. That is not a price that we should be prepared to pay. It is not something with which one wants to gamble or take risks for the sake of a bit of doctrinaire Socialism. The tax will deprive the country of the land it needs for development. The availability of land for development is not something we should risk by pushing for a rate of tax which for reasons, good or bad, some might think that we can just get away with. We should settle for a rate which will ensure that we get sufficient land for development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept the need for a special rate of tax on the granting of planning permission. Our argument is not whether there should be a tax but what its rate should be. It would not be unreasonable to consult the experts about this, and the Minister of State said, when replying to the debate on the Ways and Means Resolution:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A number of organisations were consulted on a number of detailed points,"</p></blockquote>
But they were not consulted on substantial points. He went on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"… we often accepted their recommendations. The Bill has possibly taken longer to come to the House because of that consultation, but we thought it right to consult all those bodies" OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th February 1976; Vol. 906, c. 536</p></blockquote>
I congratulate the Minister, because that is the right way to approach the problem. But why were the experts consulted only on the detail? Why were they not consulted on the most substantial and important point—the rate of tax and the consequences of that tax on the availability of land for development?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give two examples of informed opinion. The Multiple Shops Federation said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Substantial development is carried out by persons or companies, for their own occupation, in accordance with the plans and policies of local authorities."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
We need to remember that. The Federation goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposed rate of tax of 80 per cent. is considered to be totally punitive and the transitional rate of 66⅔ per cent. and higher exemption rate will be of little encouragement to multiple retail companies, many of whom will have a substantial number of development projects in their annual programmes."</p></blockquote>
I entirely agree with these views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also have the views of another organisation, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. I do not think one can turn to a body with more responsibility and knowledge of the problems of land than the Royal Institution. It has a remarkable depth of experience throughout the country. It has a very large number of members dealing with every aspect of the problem of land, and they have studied this particular point over many years. It has no doubt on this subject, and on this point it gives the rate of tax priority in its submissions. However, the Institution has consistently opposed the imposition of any tax which seeks to extract all, or almost all, of the landowner's gain. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We are convinced that the landowner must have some incentive to bring land forward for development, if housebuilding and other developments are to be encouraged."</p></blockquote>
I put it to the Government that if they consult the experts they will find a unanimous view that the rate of tax of 80 per cent. is too high. It is too high to ensure that there is an adequate supply of land for development. One cannot rely on the provisions in the Community Land Act or the actions of local authorities to make that land available for development because the Treasury will not provide the money and because they have not got the skill and expertise. The Act cannot be relied on to ensure a supply of land. Can the Government cite any expert bodies with contrary views? I can see absolutely no justification for this 80 per cent. rate except as a step on the way towards the Socialist State where 100 per cent. is the rate of tax. Indeed, it has been suggested that that is what this step is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said, in his final remarks on the Ways and Means Resolution, about our proposal to reduce the rate to 52 per cent.:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe that that is not acceptable to the majority of the British people, who think that most of the gain should accrue to the community …" OFFICIAL REPORT, 25th February 1976; Vol. 906, c. 536.</p></blockquote>
I wonder if the majority of the British peo-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
ple have been fully and adequately consulted on the point. I am not for a moment suggesting that we have a referendum, but I do not think the majority of the British people are asking for a punitive rate of tax. There is also capital gains tax to put on any capital gains which may be remaining.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it absolutely clear. The hon. Gentleman is surely not suggesting that there is to be capital gains tax as well as development tax on the betterment element. As he knows, there will not be a capital gains tax on the betterment element charged for development land tax. The two are quite separate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point, but as land is now provided there is a very substantial capital gains to put on mere inflationary changes in value. That is a very substantial discouragement to anyone to do anything which brings about the payment of that gain. I think the issue is quite clear—if we really believe in a mixed economy then there is an opportunity here for the Government to show their genuine belief. It is strongly held by many on my side of the Committee that the rate of tax should be nearer 52 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government could meet us on this issue and produce a rate which could be held to be acceptable, I would think that we on this side of the Committee would give such undertakings as necessary to make a rate which could be regarded by those concerned with development as one which would remain for some considerable time. If we can do this and have a rate which is sensible and accepted by both Government and Opposition, we will have a rate which will not interfere with the supply of land for development, and however many hours we spend in this Committee, we will have done something worthwhile.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is the most important issue in the Bill. The 80 per cent. is not acceptable and will dry up the supply of land. I am not saying that 60 per cent. is perfect, but I put it forward as a rate on which there can be general agreement and one which is sensible in a mixed economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Mr. Chairman. Can I raise a point which I omitted because I lost my note on it? You indicated that we are discussing Amendment No.32, I had thought we were only going to deal with Amendments Nos. 3 and

Gentleman, I do not intend to speak at any length on this subject. I think we are discussing the issue on the wrong premise entirely. It will be interesting to discuss the entitlement of many people in possession of vast areas of land. In my view, we are in a position where we are discussing how much tax a burglar should pay on his loot. I believe the tax proposals in this area are far too modest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The simple fact is that the enhancement of the value of land is so often linked to the fees which are being paid by the community at large. We have seen cases frequently where the local authority—and by that I do not mean the State, but the community—has paid for roads, sewerage facilities, and development generally, and the facilities it has provided on the perimeter of the community has enhanced the value of certain agricultural land enormously. The consequence has been that the value of that land has increased quite dramatically. Surely if the community has provided the services and facilities, and they are the prime cause of the land becoming a sound development prospect, the community at large should benefit from any subsequent development or at least share in the benefit which accrues. I believe the tax should be at 100 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman feel that the tax should only apply on the initial development of the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Rodgers</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would say that it should apply in all circumstances. Certainly, some of the people who have been responsible for some of the squalid areas of development in city centres and have benefited enormously from that development should not be taxed but rather fined as a consequence of what they have done in those areas. I was saying that the tax should be at 100 per cent. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) said the tax should be low at a common level in order to establish stability, but it would equally establish stability if the tax were high and at a common level. If the motive is merely to achieve that object, there is a logic behind making
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
the tax as high as possible. It would have precisely the same effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it a little odd to hear hon. Members opposite declare that they now favour a land development tax and simply query the rate at which it should be applied. I do not recall any such enthusiasm during the hey-day of speculation a couple of years ago when their Government were in office. I find it difficult to accept that hon. Members are pushing an amendment but are unable to decide what would be a proper rate of tax. It seems to me that there are such wide differences of opinion among their own ranks, and amongst their supporters outside, that they have no substance and very little heart behind the amendment they have put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In calling the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) again, I point out that there is no limit on the number of speeches hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only point I wish to make, Mr. Fitch, is that I was somewhat surprised at the inclusion of Amendment No. 32. I had hoped I would be able to avoid embarrassment in having to say anything about it. It seems to me that I cannot give my support to Amendment No. 32 because it proposes a change in a rate of taxation which should be prescribed by statutory instrument. It seems to me that the manner in which taxation is levied is important, and that there are two conditions which ought to precede legislation for taxation—the first is certainty and the second is adequate previous discussion. The statutory instrument procedure, although speedy, would preclude both certainty and adequate previous discussion. Having spent a lot of time attacking the Government over their proposals on flexibility, I am not now going to support a further element of flexibility proposed by my own side. It seems to me that taxation ought always to be fully and adequately discussed beforehand, and that is almost as important as the level of taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But one of the consequences of this was that I became, some years ago, a director of a company which owned a site in the centre of London. I am still a director, although I have no financial interest in it of any kind. But it has given me an insight into the way in which city companies operate. The objective was to develop derelict land in the centre of London which had a little twilight housing and was still suffering from war damage over twenty years later.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the site that I was describing, there is now a modern hotel that is almost entirely occupied by foreign visitors. It contributes greatly to our foreign exchange earnings. The hotel was built with the benefit of a grant offered by the Government to encourage the building of hotels. At that time, there was insufficient quality hotel accommodation available in the centre of London. For a year or so, a large part of the objectives of the company and the energies of those employed by it were devoted to getting the site into a condition in which the local authority would accept a planning application. However, it is impossible to quantify the exact outlay that was devoted to getting the site into that condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some cases, the tenants of property on the site were rehoused in better conditions at a cost which could easily be recorded in accounting terms, but a vast amount of general work was undertaken not only in negotiations with the local authority, which was anxious that the development should take place, but with owners of neighbouring property and prospective partners who would operate the hotel when it was built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A considerable amount of expense was involved in preparing the site for the eventual development. That was necessary as a precondition of having the site in a state in which planning permission might be granted. However, it was not possible—the auditors of the company were invited to comment upon this at the time—to categorise exactly where expenditure on site
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0588">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
value related to the general expenses of the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made that point at some length to pick up the comment which was made by my hon. Friend the Minister for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) on Second Reading. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is a strong case for treating them"—</p></blockquote>
that is those who are in the full-time business of developing and building—
	<br><blockquote><p>"under the ordinary company tax provisions, because the increase in land value which is being taxed is not for them just a matter of good luck, it is the result of the constant operation of their professinal skills."</p></blockquote>
[OFFICIAL REPORT: 15th March 1976; Vol. 907, c.963.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regardless of whether an absolute view is taken, it will be remembered that one of the development gains tax arrangements was that where an individual who owned land which obtained betterment was taxed, companies were taxed on land profits in the ordinary course of business. There was the first lettings tax, which was the equivalent of the deemed disposal arrangement, although it took effect at the other end of the development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not that the Opposition are necessarily pressing for all companies, or all those engaged in the full-time business of developing and building, to be treated in all circumstances as though betterment was part of their natural operations in the course of business, although there is a case to be made for that. To impose on companies a rate which is clearly influenced by public reaction to large profits being made by individuals from what have been described, quite rightly, as windfall gains, applies a rate of tax to an area in which it may have damaging effects. It is a rate of tax that has been set by reference to other criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate that has been set also relates to the impression that vast and unconscionable gains are obtained from green field sites when transformed from farming use to urban development. A great deal of the development which should take place over the next few years will be concentrated in the towns. If it is concentrated in those areas, the betterment value is likely to be a much lower proportion of the whole, and much less offensive. Therefore, that element of the tax rate should be removed. It is likely to be in the hands of builders or development companies rather than in the hands of individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that the arrangements for com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
panies have been contaminated by the fact that the level of tax has been set at what might be regarded as appropriate in the public view for taxation on betterment obtained by individuals from green field sites, and from land on the perimeter of towns where the increase in value may be very great. It is offensive and arbitrary in the sense that it may apply to one field but not to the field next door. However, such considerations do not generally apply within towns. If they have application there, it is not to the same extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In arriving at a rate of 80 per cent., the Government must have been influenced by the considerations that have been outlined, just as Lord Barber was influenced in December 1973 when he set a top rate of 83 per cent. No doubt that fact will be quoted to us by Government spokesmen. My hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) has said that, with the benefit of hindsight, that was an over-reaction because it proved to be a deterrent to the bringing forward of development land. I do not wish to rehearse all the arguments which have been so well put by my hon. Friends on that issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely something needed to be done when, under the Conservative Administration, the weighted average price per hectare of land in 1969 was £18,940, rising in 1972 to £39,490 and to £61,190 in 1973. That was a scandalous situation. Conservative Members have asked what the people want. The answer is that they want this Government to take action. Lord Barber was right, although he took rather belated action, in trying to tackle the problem by imposing a rate of 83 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no hesitation in agreeing that Lord Barber should have acted sooner. I was not a Member at the time. If I had been, I should have tried to make it clear that vast increases in value were not to anyone's benefit, except perhaps in the short term for a few individuals. I should have tried to make that clear behind the scenes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rate of any tax must bears some relationship to the circumstances of the time. Lord Barber introduced a very high rate, but it was a reaction to the phenomenon of high increases in the value of land. As the Paymaster-General has said, such times are long past. The value of land is not likely to return to the levels of 1971–73. I hope that they will not reach those levels for many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
good reasons, including the best interests of the building and development industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In prescribing a high rate such as 80 per cent., even with a concession for a band up to £150,000 to be subject to 66⅔ per cent., we are fixing rates for the indefinite future. Even the most optimistic supporters of the community land scheme do not expect the second appointed day to come forward in the near future. Therefore, the development land tax will be the structure of taxation which governs the community's charge of development gain for quite some years ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) said, it is a great shame that it does not seem possible for the Government and the Opposition broadly to agree on the level of taxation which might subsist for some considerable period, thereby bringing a degree of certainty for those whose profession it is to operate in the building and development industry. I do not know whether 60 per cent. is the right rate, but it seems unlikely that 80 per cent. is the right rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster-General has recognised the problems of the moment by introducing the welcome concession of 66⅔ per cent. over three years in the hope that it will bring land forward, but we cannot predict what the situation will be between now and 1979. There are many other factors at work that govern the supply of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Supply is not the only factor. People are inclined to enter into development only if they consider that it is viable. The Minister of State has drawn a distinction between gain whilst land is in the hands of a company, which is part of the cost of the land, and the trading profits of a company. In many periods in the past there has been the active development of land for housing. Many developers and builders have developed at either no profit or at a very small profit. Only the fact that they have sold land at a profit, arising from the fact that they could sell it in small parcels, has allowed such development to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the deemed disposal of land and the fact that a rate of tax has been set, notwithstanding the uncertainties of development outside the housing sector stretching more than a year ahead, there will be a disincentive. In some cases, the viability will be considered marginal and not worthwhile, but in other cases the decision to develop would have been taken.

It may be that the Government will wish to reduce the rate of development land tax

before a specific period, and not necessarily for sums up to £150,000. By 1979 they may be anxious to encourage industrial development. The building of new factories has come almost to a halt in the past two years. In those circumstances, they might wish either to reduce the rate of 80 per cent. for development gains, or they might wish to reduce the 66⅔ per cent. to encourage the bringing forward of smaller parcels of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Development land tax must be flexible like any other tax. It must take account of the economic and commercial circumstances of the time. To place the whole scheme on a fixed basis at the outset, regardless of what may come about over the next three years, which is the period of the concession, or over the long period before the community land scheme can possibly come into full operation, is to remove flexibility. That is why we tabled Amendment No. 32. We felt that on some occasion the Government might reasonably want to bring forward development in a hurry. A concessionary rate for one year, or for some limited period, might achieve that development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If these rates of tax are fixed for more or less doctrinaire reasons, or a combination of those and the fact that it is intended that the scheme shall work its way up to 100 per cent. and eventually into the community land scheme, the flexibility that we desire will not be available. None of us knows what conditions may be like during the operation of the development land tax. However, if applied as the Government now intend, it will set the framework for development for quite a few years to come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems a pity that because we are not able to reach agreement at the outset we are to lose a valuable chance, which will probably not be recovered, of giving certainty and stability to an industry which has already suffered very much due to other economic circumstances in recent years. There is a strong case for the Government to look again at the rate that they intend to introduce and to consider the disincentive effect of high rates of tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
