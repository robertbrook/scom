	<p>	<i>Question proposed—[30th March]—</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hardly begun to comment on Clause 2 when the last sitting ended. I have a large number of comments to make on the clause as a whole. Like my right hon. Friend, I welcome the assistance we have received in our discussion of amendments to Clause 2. In particular, we welcome the realistic view of the Government about the need to reconsider the length of what can be defined as a long lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think that none of us can be too happy about the way in which major interests are defined. To define them as any interests other than those which are specifically excluded always raises the danger that something may have been missed out, and I believe that our discussions on chief rents—on which I hope Treasury Ministers will have something to say—illustrate the fact that we have already been able to put our finger on at least one point of considerable and material doubt, which is not clear from the Bill, as to whether such chief rents are meant to be regarded as major interests or not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Major interests, at least as affected by the deemed disposal procedure, should be directly related to the development taking place, preferably the interests of the developer or builder himself, but not that, at least demonstrably connected with the activities of the party which has initiated or undertaken the project of material development. Therefore, one of the wider problems raised here is establishing which of the peripheral or indirect interest in land in any case is actually affected by the deemed disposal procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>146</span>
We are not happy about the present shape, form and import of Clause 2. We shall probably be able to restrain ourselves from voting against Clause standing part but, if we do so, that may encourage Ministers to enlighten us on some of the points on which we still feel a need for clarification.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main problem with the whole Bill, which is exemplified by Clause 2—the first of the nuts and bolts clauses and the first of many that we shall debate—is that of interpretation. I draw the Committee's attention to some remarks made by the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Rodgers) on Second Reading when he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My heart goes out to my colleagues in local government who will be expected to assimilate the clauses and exemptions. I hope that considerable Government assistance will be made available to members and officials of local authorities and that they will have the full co-operation of the Government in interpreting and implementing this measure."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 15th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 1020.]</p></blockquote>
I told the hon. Gentleman that I would raise this point and he said that he was unfortunately not likely to be with us at the beginning of this afternoon's sitting, but I believe that I am not misrepresenting him when I say that he shares the feeling of many of us that the Bill is still largely incomprehensible in many parts. Unfortunately, with Clause 2, we have run into this sort of thing at the outset. Not all of us are trained as professional barristers, tax counsel, Treasury Ministers, solicitors or property men.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Or merchant bankers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, I do not know about that. But we ordinary blokes find a good deal of difficulty in understanding what these things mean. The problem of comprehensibility falls into two parts. First, what do the actual words and phrases in the Bill mean? Secondly, once one has established in ordinary English what they mean, to what type of transaction are they meant to refer?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We on this side of the Committee have taken advice and discussed the implications of the Bill, as we would be expected to do, with various professionals and bodies interested in the working of the development land tax. In a number of cases they have been unable to understand what type of transaction is envisaged to be covered by particular parts of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>147</span>
I return, Mr. Fitch—and I hope that it is in order for me to do so, because it illustrates the point—to Amendment No. 5. The Minister of State spoke of easements, restrictive covenants or interests in land of that kind, possibly having market values of £100,000 on a deemed disposal—not, let us mark it, in any circumstance where such an interest in land is actually required to be bought out, and where the market value can therefore be seen to exist, but in some notional sense that, without having to be bought out or negotiated, such indirect and intangible interests in land are thought in some cases to have values of £100,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister refers to potential transactions of deemed disposals of that kind, with such values, it raises the question of what he is referring to. He would not mention it unless he had in mind a specific type of transaction which would be affected in this way. Therefore, all those who will have to operate the Bill will ask themselves—and they will not find the answer from the discussions we have had on Clause 2 so far—what exactly is meant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We put down Amendment No. 5 because we thought it would be an improvement to the Bill and would eliminate a number of cases of doubt where the valuation process would have to be gone through to no ultimate purpose. We thought that it would simplify the administration of the Bill and reduce the time, expense and labour involved in dealing with it. But, in a sense, all amendments to the Bill have to be probing amendments as well, to see whether in discussing these points we may have some elucidation of the type of transaction the Government have in mind. We realise that it is difficult, with a Bill of such complexity, for every item to be considered in detail and explained in advance. But provisions of this kind would not be put in without good reason, and our sensible amendment, in that case, would not have been resisted unless the Government had good reason, with specific types of transaction in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proceedings of the Committee, therefore, are bound to be regarded as an important source of comment—indeed, as perhaps in future as a work of reference by professionals, district valuers, builders, auditors and so on, in their interpretation of the way the Bill is expected to operate. I do not wish to delay the Committee by
	<span class='label label-info column'>148</span>
making any more of this point, but I believe that it would assist the progress of the Bill if Ministers could advise us how they will communicate to us these genuine points of information which arise from so many of our discussions. Perhaps they would like us to write to them, and perhaps they will ask their officials to take note of any such points in our verbal proceedings so that they can be picked up at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be put on record at this stage that we are still without understanding in many cases, even though we may now feel that we understand what the wording means, of what type of transactions or interest is intended to be covered by particular clauses in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Government to try to assist the Committee—and this is, in no sense, a political point—because it would greatly help if we knew what they meant by having asked the parliamentary draftsmen to phrase their clauses in a certain way. That has not been adequately put as regards this clause, but the Government should have another opportunity to explain exactly what is meant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) suggested that we had not fully explained the implications of this clause. If that is the case, I am sorry because we have done our best to explain, as clearly as we can, these complicated provisions. I am somewhat surprised at what he had said because we have gone a long way to try to meet objections from the other side, and we shall continue to so so. We shall try to explain these provisions as clearly as possible during the course of this Committee. If I reserve a point, or if I cannot accept an amendment but give a commitment to look at it, that means that we shall seriously and genuinely consult the parliamentary draftsmen and, if possible, bring forward an amendment on Report. That is the normal practice in these Committees. When I give an undertaking, it is seriously and genuinely meant. On reflection, perhaps the hon. Member may think that his criticisms went too far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it will be accepted that this is in no sense meant to be a personal criticism of the Minister. As I have admitted, he elucidated a number of points but it is still not understood what is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>149</span>
meant to be covered by certain aspects of the Bill, on which we have had no such undertakings. If he were to give such undertakings, we would all greatly appreciate them, and I would not wish to take the point further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the hon. Gentleman says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now turn to the specific points raised in this debate. We have had a long debate on amendments, and we have discussed these matters fully, but I wish to deal with two or three of the specific points that were raised in the debate on the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) made a valid point. He said that some of these interests, easements, rights of way and restrictive covenents may be minor interests, and that people holding or owning them may, on occasion, not know that a development was going on, and may be surprised at the end of the day to receive an assessment from the Inland Revenue. In theory, I accept that that is a possibility. In practice, however—and I assure him, as, indeed, he will know—the owner of an interest which is likely to draw an assessment, because it is an interest with development value, such as a restrictive covenant, or—and this is more likely—a right of way, will often know that his interest is important and that a developer will know about that interest. A developer often cannnot go ahead without the consent of the person holding such interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, therefore, a developer will know that either he must get agreement, or, as sometimes happens, buy out the owner of that interest. The owner of such an interest will know that it is valuable because many such interests are registered on the title. I do not think that there will be a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day, however, the Revenue has certain powers to make inquiries, and we shall come to these when we discuss Schedule 8. I appreciate what the right hon. Member says, but with the £10,000 exemption, and with the £5,000 exemption which is written into the clause in relation to the size of these interests, there should be no practical problem. In most cases, people with valuable interests will know their value, developers may know their value and often they will buy out these interests.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>150</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not think it unfair—assuming for the moment a case in which an interest is sacrificed and thus bought out, such as a right to life or any other—that the buying out of that interest is because the property is made that much less valuable? In other words, the buying out is compensating a person for the loss of an amenity. Surely to tax him on losing an amentity, when the payment merely puts him back in the position he started from, is an unjust proposition?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He is paid because he loses an amenity, but often he accepts payment in lieu or because of the loss of that amenity. It is not a case of putting him back in the same position. He is disposing of an asset that is worth something. If it is worth something, he pays taxation on it. Of course, this applies in other areas of taxation as well as under this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the point raised by the hon. Member for Hitchin, who mentioned chief rents. I thought I touched upon this previously. I assume that what the Opposition mean by "chief rents" is a rent charge. As I understand chief rents, they ceased to exist after 1938. But if the hon. Gentleman means something that is colloquially known as a chief rent, which is in fact a rent charge, I will deal with what he was saying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I must correct the Minister on this. Chief rents still remain in parts of the country. Many of them went in Islington a few years ago, but there are still some left there. There are some in South Wales, and there are a great number in the North-West—Manchester, Liverpool, and my own constituency. They are payments out of the freehold. They are not rent charges out of any form of lease. They are called chief rents, and are merely a payment by the freeholder under a form of covenant which allows usually a right of entry on nonpayment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman says that chief rents allow a right of entry. I do not dispute that. I do not want to embark upon a semantic disputation. If they involve a right of entry
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>151</span>
or right of possession, they come into the legislation 	<i>prima facie</i> under subsection 3(	<i>a</i>) as major interests. They do not come under subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) (	<i>i</i>) or (	<i>ii</i>) because subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>) (	<i>i</i>) and (	<i>ii</i>) deal with interests that do not confer right of possession. In practice, the rent will not reflect development value. In most cases the rent merely reflects current use value. Therefore, in the vast majority of cases I should not have thought that there would be any question of development value. However, if the rent reflects development value, then in the one case out of 100 there might be some land duty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the Minister is probably right on the question of whether they reflect the development value. However, he has raised a question in my mind which troubles me. He has talked about the right of possession. Does it mean in the Act that the right of possession is a right of forfeiture on nonpayment? I would have thought that the right of possession, as used in the clause, referred to some form of reversion, some normal right to take possession at a certain time, not merely taking possession on a default in payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure. The right of possession is as defined in Section 205(1) of the Law of Property Act 1925. I thought that that referred to a specific right of possession on a non-payment of rent or whatever charges had to be paid. But if this rent charge does not confer that right to possession as defined in Section 205, it does not come within this particular subsection. We look at the major provision, and it is probably a major interest. If it is a major interest, 	<i>prima facie</i> comes into it within the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the practical point is—I notice the right hon. Gentleman nodding—that these rents do not reflect development value. Many of them were fixed a very long time ago. If they are chief rents in the way that I understood chief rents, they were fixed a considerable time ago. But if they are rent charges, they probably, in practice, will not reflect development value, and so there would not be a charge. However, there may be some cases where they do reflect development value, and in such cases the legislation might well apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hitchin also dealt with the complexities in relation to
	<span class='label label-info column'>152</span>
local government. I remind him that Clause 2 itself will not affect local government officials at all, in the sense that it is concerned with deemed disposals. When we come to later provisions of the Bill, when local authorities purchase land and pay money for that land, then the net of tax arrangements will apply, and we can discuss the clause later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in relation to the net of tax arrangements, the complexities of the legislation need not influence local authorities or impinge upon them to a great extent. They will be concerned only with a formula deduction, and we have tried to keep that as simple as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is nothing in this clause to make life difficult for local authorities, because it is a deemed disposal situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt with the main points that were raised. As I said previously, this is a complicated area, but we had to have some certainty because in dealing with land law and taxation it is necessary to be fairly certain. We have tried to employ words which have a meaning in the law of property and which will be well understood by surveyors, lawyers and people who have to deal with this kind of legislation. I hope that the Opposition will decide not to vote against this clause, although I accept that they have reservations about the deemed disposal. We have tried to meet them on a number of occasions and, after consultation, we shall bring forward various amendments on Report which will reflect our desire to meet them. With that assurance, I hope that the Committee will accept the clause as being essential for the purposes of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prolong this debate, but one or two points which the Minister has stated in his speech raise problems and I think it is valuable to clear them up at this early stage in the debate, because they will arise in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that persons with, I will call it another interest—not a major or minor interest but another interest in land than the main interest—will very often know about the development which causes the deemed disposal. It seems to me to be an extraordinarily sloppy way of drafting legislation to do so on the basis that someone who is going to have to pay the development land tax will very often know that he is going to be liable. The Minister
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>153</span>
said that on occasions the developer cannot proceed without the consent of the person owning that other interest. It is not only the question of whether the owner will know, but it is the question of whether he will have an opportunity to prevent the whole of the tax being payable by him at this stage. Is he going to know about the project which causes the deemed disposal?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me take as an example the ground landlord under a long lease. The tenant decides that he is going to develop. It may be or it may not be that the ground landlord will be liable for tax on a major interest under Clause 2. But he is entirely in the hands of the tenant, first as to being told about the intended project of material development, and secondly, being able to say what he, the landlord, wishes it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be of great advantage to the tenant to have the project of material development cover a very large estate and if the tenant happens to be a trader in land, it does not matter to him whether anybody is paying development land tax not, because he will pay income tax. If the developer owns the leasehold of this land as his stock in trade and has a planning permission on it on 12th September 1974, he is going to be free of development land tax altogether. Yet, by starting to develop he is imposing a liability at once on the ground landlord I have assumed in this case. If the ground landlord's rent reflects the development value, the ground landlord may be liable for development tax on the whole of the development value of his interest, although the person who has brought about that liability escapes tax altogether. The tenant who is holding the land as his stock in trade with a planning permission on it may escape altogether from paying the development land tax, but his landlord will have to pay. His landlord might say "All right, I know I have got to pay the tax. It has got to be paid under Clause 2. I have got a major interest, but, for heaven's sake, I do not want to pay it on 1,000 acres. I do not want that to be the project of major development. Can we not have it on 10 acres to start with and spread out my liability?" But as far as I can see he has no right under the cluase to know anything about it at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tenant is under no obligation to tell his landlord about it. That must be corrected. Further, if he does know about
	<span class='label label-info column'>154</span>
it he has no right to say how his liability shall be spread over—whether it shall be a large project of material development or merely a small one, or done in instalments. I do not believe that this can be corrected at this stage in the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend said that we would not seek to remove the clause from the Bill. However, we shall endeavour to put in safeguards later in the Bill for the man who is saddled with a liability, perhaps not knowing that it is coming, and having no right to say how much his liability shall be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The statement by the Minister that the owner of other rights will often know about development, and that sometimes the development cannot proceed without his consent, does not solve the problem. He said that he thought there would not be problems in practice. I believe there will be great problems in practice unless we can put this right by some escape clauses later in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to prolong the debate, but I should like to comment on two points made by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). I accept, as I said earlier, that there may be some difficulties. I do not believe that in practice they will be great difficulties. May I repeat, however, in relation to interests which may have development value, that if an interest like an easement has development value the man who owns the easement is an important person to be consulted. It is because he has got development value in his easement, such as a right of way, that the man who is carrying out the development will have to take that person, the owner of the right of way, into account. If the easement has no development value the owner of the easement does not need to worry in the first place. If there is development value, that is because he has something which can affect the development of the man who is starting the project of material development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the developer starting the project will be concerned with the interests of somebody who has a right over the land and whose right is valuable in terms of the development. Therefore, the two will often get together, and people will know what their rights are because those rights, if they have development value, will influence and affect the development, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>155</span>
the consent of the person owning those rights will often be needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the second point, concerning landlords, I accept that there may be a case where the landlord will not know. However, if the landlord's rent does not reflect development value the landlord does not need to worry. If his rent does reflect development value, he knows that very well. He may have known that when he fixed the rent, and he will then be ill a position to appreciate that the development may take place. Rents will no doubt sometimes be fixed to reflect development value. Sometimes the consent of the landlord will be needed to carry out the development, and the rent may be changed to reflect that development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have thought, therefore, that in practice landlords who have interests where the rent reflects developemnt value will know fairly well that a development is to take place, and the tenant and the landlord will get together again because the tenant will not want to proceed in those circumstances without discussions with the landlord.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that there might be difficulties and we can consider them again in relation to further schedules to the Bill, but in practice I do not believe those difficulties will be as considerable as has been suggested.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 10, in page 70, line 25, leave out "in the course".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of enumerating the specified operations is to allow a time to be fixed at which a specified operation starts, so that the time at which the tax may bite can be identified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is plain from our earlier discussions
	<span class='label label-info column'>156</span>
that it is of advantage to the taxpayer that the time at which the material development may be taken to have started may be delayed in certain instances, or, at any rate, that the taxpayer should be in a position to opt for a delayed start. The object of the amendment is to allow the taxpayer the option to fix a later time for payment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the provision worded as it is, even the digging of a ditch or other activity ancillary and preliminary to the erection of the building, would be taken to be within the words "in the course of", whereas, by deleting those words, it would relate only to the actual work of erecting the building, and the time, therefore, would not begin to start until the walls started to go up. That would be a better way of allowing the taxpayer to defer his liability from this heavy tax and giving him the opportunity of deferring it until building has started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is more than a technical amendment, and the parliamentary draftsman may well advise the Minister that the intention is not carried out by the wording. The words "in the course of", however, are quite as vague as the idea that I am attempting to put forward on behalf of my hon. Friends. We want the taxpayer to be able to defer the time at which the tax starts to bite, and I suggest that the Minister, who has shown himself very reasonable in this matter, ought to attempt a form of words which would allow the spirit of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
But with respect to my hon. Friend, the words "in the course of" appear in two sub-paragraphs. The first, (	<i>a</i>), says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any work of construction in the course of the erection of a building".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend addressed his remarks to the words "in the course of" there, asking, in short, what they meant and whether the specified operation would probably be identified if one used the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0653">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>157</span>
words "in the course of". Although he was addressing his mind to sub-paragraph (	<i>a</i>), the amendment refers to sub-paragraph (	<i>e</i>). Indeed, the same principle applies there. But in that case sub-paragraph (	<i>e</i>), relating to the winning or working of minerals, uses a new phraseology to that used in other legislation for the same purpose—planning and so on. I was puzzled why these words were introduced here, unless it meant that every action in the course of winning or working minerals could be a specified operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one starts the operation of winning or working minerals, it is a specified operation and one can say when it starts. But if some act in the course of winning or working minerals is to be a specified operation, it may well be that, having started the mineral process and winning or working the minerals, and perhaps pausing for a month or two while seams are examined and surveys carried out as to the direction in which one should go next, it will be said to be something in the course of winning or working minerals and that a new project has been started. That is why we propose in the amendment to leave out the words "in the course of". Why not leave it as an operation for winning or working minerals? We know from the previous subsection that it is the beginning of the specified operation that we have to consider, not the beginning of something in the course of the specified operation. I hope I have put it right. The Minister nods and I am sure he has got the point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the point of the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) perfectly well. He is quite right. When we wanted to fix a time at which an operation starts, we wanted a fair degree of precision. He accepted that point, for which I am grateful. The hon. Gentleman also pointed out that it might be possible to fix a precise period of time somewhat later, and I understand his reason—to maintain the precision which we regard as important, as he does. But there is a difference between us in so far as he would like to fix it later, the development land tax being payable at a later date. I understand that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the words "in the course of" not only is it the intention of the amendment, as I see it, to defer the
	<span class='label label-info column'>158</span>
date of the disposal until inspection begins, but we need to look beyond this amendment to Amendment No. 12, to which we shall come in due course. If we take the amendments together, it will be seen that, in the case of a mixed project of the kind the Oppsoition want to include, by way of concession, as it were, the date of the deemed disposal could be deferred for a very long time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could all think of a number of examples where one part of a mixed project was to win minerals and another part was for a different purpose entirely. The less attractive part might be the winning of minerals, which could be deferred for a very long time, proceeding at a leisurely pace, while the other buildings—whatever they may be—were put up. The charge to development land tax could, in effect, never become payable because the first part—the winning of minerals—was proceeding at that pace. If we look at that aspect, we might reach some agreement on some of the problems that we see here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem, I understand—the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West referred to it briefly—is that of the time when mineral working might be considered as commencing. We have here the problems of the trial boring. This is serious because—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>indicated assent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>:—there are certain trial borings where there is no development but a number of shafts are sunk and a number of borings made purely to discover where the site should be. Clearly, this could produce complexities of the kind that have been referred to. I should hope to give the assurance that we are not considering that kind of exploratory operation because that does not of itself necessarily generate liability. We are concerned here—this is fundamental to the amendment—about the mixed project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman might note from Clause 17 that development purely for mineral working is exempt. We are concerned about the kind of mixed project that we have been talking about. Under these mixed projects, the development land tax might never be paid. So, with the best will in the world, and understanding the point that the hon. Gentleman might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0654">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>159</span>
wish to make, I am afraid that we are unable to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned Clause 17, which is the familiar one about the 50 per cent. split in the obtaining of minerals, which we have had in previous legislation. This relates to the liability for the tax. Clause 17 states the development value, in the case of winning and working minerals, on which the tax will be paid. Schedule 1 deals merely with the commencement of the project of material development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It becomes confusing when one looks at other statutes. For example, the Community Land Act, in talking of exempt development—it is much the same point as Schedule 1 in this Bill—uses the phraseology:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The winning and working, on land held or occupied with land used for the purposes…"</p></blockquote>
that is, agricultural land—
	<br><blockquote><p>"of … minerals …"</p></blockquote>
There the draftsmen used, and Parliament accepted, the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"winning and working of minerals"</p></blockquote>
as an exempt development. Apparently there was thought to be no difficulty in describing it as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the situation here, all we are concerned with is when this mining operation is starting. There is a project to mine, to dig out the gravel or whatever it may be. When does that operation start? I should have thought it simple to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"the operation of winning or working"</p></blockquote>
and we could say that what we mean by the project of material development is when we start the operation, not when we start to do something in the course of that operation. This is where it will be confusing to those who have to interpret the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, this problem is of some considerable importance to the mineral working industry. Normally, that industry buys up a substantial area of land to carry out the progressive winning or working of minerals. Although it may have a certainty that it will be able to phase out the planning permissions or phase them in, planning permission is put in for the stages at which it wishes to take the gravel or other mineral out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we had it defined merely as the opera-
	<span class='label label-info column'>160</span>
tion of winning or working minerals, I presume that in those circumstances, when application was made for planning or developing a part of the area owned by the mineral undertaking, that would be the project of material development. But, as the clause stands, even that is left in doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the mineral-working landowner puts in a planning application to develop so many square yards, or hectares, or acres of his land, is that in the course of the operation of winning or working minerals, so that it might be said that he is developing the whole of his area merely by starting on one small part? It rather puts it out of his hands to argue the point with the Inland Revenue or with others who have rights in the property. These words are not a matter of life and death; I wish only to get them right for those who have to work this operation. If the Minister will say that he will talk to the mineral operators, say, the sand and gravel people, before the next stage of the Bill, I am sure my hon. Friend will be quite happy. It is merely to make quite certain that those people who have to operate know what we are talking about here. Previously, they have known the phrase without the words "in the course of", but suddenly they have these words nipped in, and they will be left in doubt over whether they mean anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None of us really understands what the words "in the course of" actually mean. The Minister said, very fairly, that the issue is partly one of precision and partly one of date of payment, but really the more important issue is that of precision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a philosophical difference between us as to the time of payment, but it is perhaps more important that the taxpayer should know where he stands. The Minister has not yet been able to convince the Committee that he or anyone else understands what the words "in the course of" mean. No one can force him to explain them. I suspect that it is a very wide way of describing this concept, and all we would ask is that he asks his advisers to reconsider this and try to find, if possible, a more precise form of words. It does seem to us that wherever the words "in due course of" are used, they are very wide, and could give rise to misunderstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am always happy to respond to any request for consultations. One of the improvements that has been made by the Treasury is in the number of consultations that take place now as a matter of course. So any request of that kind, whether from the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) or the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) will always strike an appreciative chord in me. I am afraid, however, that it will be very difficult to find words that express more clearly than those we have here. If anybody has a bright idea, I shall be more than pleased to listen at any time to further suggestions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Crosby pointed out that
	<br><blockquote><p>"winning and working on land of minerals"</p></blockquote>
is a phrase that is well understood, and I accept that it is. It has become entrenched in much of our legal definitions over a fair period of time, and it is understood. But here we are dealing with something a little different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing—and I refer him to what I said a little while ago—with mixed development. We are not dealing with the winning of minerals of their own. If that were the case, we could deal with the matter more easily. We are concerned with mixed developments, and because of that we are enabled to take account of the mineral side alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West referred to a more suitable time when the walls are going up. Anyone who has watched the process of development from the beginning until the time when the final tile is laid, or the garden is set out, knows full well the difficulty of saying at what point one can draw a dividing line. Though those dividing lines have stood the test of time—I grant not for a long time—we can build on efforts made to legislate in these areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I point out to the right hon. Member for Crosby that Clause 17 gives complete exemption for mineral working. There may have been a little confusion about the 50 per cent. rule which is for the actual disposal of the development. We are thus concerned in this amendment with the mixed type of development. It is about that that we must express some anxiety, because it could be of very great advantage to have a mixed development, part of which is concerned with the winning of minerals and part concerned
	<span class='label label-info column'>162</span>
with other kinds of development, and as a result of which the charge payable under the development land tax proposals could be deferred indefinitely while mineral-working progressed at a very leisurely pace, whereas the other kind of commercial or other development proceeded much more quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have this exemption for mineral working, it is reasonable to make this kind of provision for mixed developments which are the subject of the amendment, which I hope the hon. Gentleman will not press.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Salisbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 11, in page 70, leave out lines 27 and 28.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, we are dealing with an amendment with venerable origins. I do not know how many or in which Finance Acts it has appeared in, but I find some interesting parallels in the Land Commission Act 1967, where we find nearly the same wording:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any change in the use of any land, where that change constitutes material development".</p></blockquote>
That has the important addition of the word "material".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister might be entertained if he read what his right hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) said during the Committee proceedings on the Land Commission Act on this point. It goes on for several pages and I will not read it all out, although it would be more than relevant. I believe it was my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey (Mr. Ross) who originally suggested that these words should be omitted from the Land Commission Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we have here a wording that has been debated several times already. What we must look at is the difference between development and material development. The Minister may say that this amendment is in the wrong place, and I may be prepared to accept that we should perhaps be looking at Schedule 4, Part II because we may have the wrong wording. It may be that we want material development rather than just any development. There would seem to be a significant problem if the wording is left as it stands at this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>163</span>
We must look forward to see the effects of sub-paragraphs (5) and (6), which are relevant to this particular point, where we again have the problem of difference between material development and development. Those words could be confusing to those who are not party to our proceedings in the case of a project or development which does not include any development other than the material change of use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also find that if we leave this "change of use" subsection in, a change of use affecting a very small part of a building could have massive implications because there is the suggestion in sub-paragraph (6) that
	<br><blockquote><p>"In sub-paragraph (5) above 'hereditament', in relation to a project of material development, means the aggregate of the land which, at the date on which that project is begun, forms the subject of a single entry in the valuation list or, in Scotland, the valuation roll for the time being in force for a rating area."</p></blockquote>
I find that alarming because in many cases—certainly in the more densely developed urban areas—large complex of buildings, sometimes in my experience held under a variety of tenure with a variety of superior landlords, can still constitute a single entry in the valuation roll. This seems to imply that if a change of use constitutes, for the purposes of the Bill, a specified operation, we could find that we are in turn run into a deemed disposal of a large complex of buildings for a small-scale change of use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Schedule 4, Part II there is a list of exclusions of items which shall not constitute material development. But no-where in that list do we find any exclusions relating to change of use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that, whereas one is allowed to rebuild or redevelop with a 10 per cent. cubic addition and not be actually carrying out material development for the purposes of this Bill, any change of use, however small, will constitute a trigger for the operation of a deemed disposal provision. That is a horrifying thought. The whole area of change of use is complex. It is open to argument very often as to what does constitute change of use. It is often open to argument as to whether something recognised as being in theory a change of use, in practice requires planning approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, it is within my experience that when one has asked a local authority for
	<span class='label label-info column'>164</span>
planning permission for something which one was convinced was a change of use, the local authority has more or less said "Don't bother us. It's all right. Don't let's go through the rigmarole." This particularly occurs when it is a small-scale change of use which, if it had to have planning permission, would equally trigger off the mechanism for an office development planning and bring in central, as well as local government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is one of the reasons why sometimes local authorities are inclined to regard it not as a change of use, because of the complications that can ensue from recognising something as a change of use. Clearly, in cases of change of use there is difficulty in determining the time at which it actually takes place. It is not like other forms of specified operation where one knows when the man actually digs the ditch in which to put the foundation or the drain. One may empty an area preparatory for a change of use and even carry out quite a lot of works of adaptation, but technically one has not actually changed the use until one moves in and uses it for the other purpose. That is another complication with which we are familiar in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it then becomes necessary to assess the value of a change of use before the necessary works are carried out, there will be a fresh area of complication. It is common knowledge that there is no form of building operation more difficult to cost accurately in advance than modifications and adaptations to existing buildings, and the value of the end product will clearly depend very much upon the cost of carrying out the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings us back to the point mentioned earlier about trying to find ways of reducing the cost of collecting this tax, particularly in relation to the amounts to be raised. It seems to me that a change of use is likely to give rise to a fairly small amount of tax becoming payable but a very large amount of collection problems and administrative costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want to do anything that will make it more difficult to use existing buildings to the best effect and for the best purpose. I am concerned that by making change of use a specified operation for the purposes of the Bill we are present-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>165</span>
ing an obstacle to the encouragement of flexibility in the use of existing buildings and inevitably also a major source of delay in carrying out the changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore suggest to the Government that at the very least we want some fairly sweeping 	<i>de minimis</i> provision. I do not know whether there is a Latin expression which takes us up a little further than a 	<i>de minimis</i> provision or what it would correctly be. I am sure that the Minister can tell me that. In other words, anything other than a very substantial change of use should not constitute a specified operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may tell me that this is something that we should look at when we reach Part II of Schedule 4. If he does, I am sure that we shall be reassured by that. We should be even more reassured, of course, if at an early stage we were to see an appropriate amendment put down by the Government to that part of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) raised the question whether the amendment might be in the wrong place or even whether it might be wrongly worded. He was forthcoming on both of those aspects. I might say, having endured many years on the Opposition benches, that that is not a point that I would ever stress. I am concerned with the intention behind the amendment. If it is in the wrong place, that can be put right. If it has the wrong wording, that too can be put right. My concern is with the intention behind the amendment, which the hon. Gentleman expressed very clearly and fairly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment does, however, present a number of problems to which I shall refer. The list that we have of the specified operations indicates "material development". The intention of the amendment is to exclude change of use from the list of specified operations. As a result, it would also incidentally defer the date of the deemed disposal, and so clearly it is in line with many of the points that the Opposition seek to change in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two problems, however. The first concerns the change of use when, as the hon. Gentleman said, it may affect only a small part of a large building and may have its consequences upon the large building itself. He referred to that as alarming.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are really back at the fundamentals
	<span class='label label-info column'>166</span>
of the operation of the Bill, and that is that in any Development Land Tax Bill such as this, and the kind of Bill that I think the Opposition are coming to accept, in principle at least, there should be relation between the tax chargeable and the benefit to the developer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the second point. The change of use, in itself, has always been regarded as a cause for taxation. There was change of use under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. It has a long and, I should have thought, an honourable history. Development gains and development values can change not only from the erection of a building or the development of an open site, but it can arise also from the change of use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman fairly says that there may be cases in which the development is very small, in so far as the increase in values arising from that small change of use is small, consequently there will be a small payment of development land tax, or, under the first tranche that we are happy to concede, there may be no development land tax at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the hon. Gentleman says that there can be a small change of use which, as it affects the whole building or the whole development site, can have large consequences, then the large consequence that I think he foresees is the large increase in development value arising from that change in use. Under this Bill, a large change in development value would have a corresponding level of tax levied against that increase in value. So even though the change may be small, the value may be large, and it is upon the value that the tax is payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman points out that that might be a discouragement to change of use. I take his point. I suppose it could be said that all taxation is a discouragement to act in the way of paying more tax. That is one of the features of taxation which has been debated many times, but it has always been concluded in those debates that the methods of paying tax and the way in which taxation is levied must be related to the values increased or the income or the capital, whatever it may be, that is available for such taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is exactly the same principle as we are applying here and which, by implication, the Opposition, by not voting against the Second Reading, have come to accept. I understand their reservations
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>167</span>
fully, and we shall debate them in due course. But I do not know how we can allow a change of use to escape development land tax when, for instance, a Mayfair house is turned into offices and the development values are substantially increased, or in the much humbler examples—perhaps the kind that the hon. Gentleman had in mind where the same principles do apply—at a lower level, I grant—where the change of use can, in itself be an increase in value, large or small, which will determine the amount of tax chargeable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to the precedent of change of use giving rise to taxation. But the more important question arises from the Finance Act 1974, where the User Classes Order was a great deal simplified for the purposes of taxation. The User Classes Order is a very lengthy document and specifies a large number of classes of development, some of which have rather small differences, particularly in the various categories of industrial activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1974 Finance Act these were reduced to six different classes, which had much the effect that I was seeking—that a wide-ranging 	<i>de minimis</i> provision should apply to change of use. In particular, Class B, for example, included within it the use either as an office or as a retail shop. I know that shops are Class 1. I am not sure whether offices are Class 2. Those more expert in the law than I will probably put me right. It simplied the matter so that only significant substantial changes of use became taxable. That was the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister says that the amount of tax is small. We want to avoid the delay, the complication and the costs of collecting not only small amounts of tax but in many cases finding out that there is no tax to pay, or, as the Minister suggested, that the amount that would be paid would come within the exemptions of the first tranche. It we look at the redevelopment, we find that one is allowed to redevelop and add 10 per cent. to the cube of the existing building without becoming liable to the tax in any way. Therefore, it seems illogical to say that whatever the size of the change of use, it should be taxable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could adopt a similar approach of saying that a change of use involving less
	<span class='label label-info column'>168</span>
than 10 per cent of the cubic area of the hereditament should be exempt in the same way as a redevelopment should be. If one could combine that with the simplification of the User Classes. Order for which we have the precedent of the all-party Finance Act 1974—this is based upon Lord Barber's proposals which were enacted by the Socialist Government—I would have thought we would have gone a long way to meeting the purpose of the amendment. Its purpose is to avoid bringing all types of change of use into the category of specified operation and triggering the deemed disposal mechanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was for that reason that I suggested that perhaps the Minister would say that the amendment was in the wrong place or was wrongly worded. My right hon. and hon. Friends would go along with saying that one could not exclude change of use altogether. In the example that the Minister gave, if any Mayfair houses are left to be changed into offices—I fear that most of those changes may have taken place, and we should now be concerned with changing them back into houses—clearly a large-scale change of use would logically need to be included. We would run ourselves into a lot of complexities and extra administrative costs unless we could find some way of taking out of specified operation a large number of changes of use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take this step by step?

Now that I have risen to my feet again, I apologise to the Financial Secretary for not welcoming him to the Committee when I first spoke. Now he has set the precedent of a Minister who is entitled to attend a Committee when he is not a member of that Committee, there will be a good precedent for asking for the attendance of the Law Officers, who are in the same position, if my procedure is correct, as the Treasury Ministers. Having succeeded in getting the Financial Secretary here, I trust that in due course we shall get the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the Lord Advocate, because the Bill deals with Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may take this step by step Schedule 1, Part I, paragraph 2 (2)(	<i>f</i>) refers to development. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any change in the use of any land, where that change constitutes development"</p></blockquote>
shall be a specified operation. That is an operation which starts a project of material development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In previous legislation when the change in use of land has been referred to in this kind of context, it is said where that change constitutes material development. I agree that it is not in the 1974 Act; but elsewhere, when we deal with change of use something which will trigger off an important liability, it is change of use which constitutes a material development. I am not sure whether my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), in the kindness of his heart or in his devotion to public duty, is arguing on behalf of the Board of Inland Revenue or on behalf of the landowner or the developer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is possible, of course, if this stands as it is, and if it could be any change of use which is a project of material development, that if one changes the use of one room in a block of offices or one room of a block of flats—if one turns one room of a flat in Dolphin Square into an office, that would be a change of use of the whole of Dolphin Square. This is a material development of the whole of the relevant and the the relevant interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we leave it as it stands, we are told in the interpretation clause, on page 68, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"'development' and 'development order' have the meaning assigned to them by the relevant planning enactment".</p></blockquote>
Every member of the Committee knows that the relevant enactment in this case is the Town and Country Planning Act 1971—it is very familiar to those of us who took part in the Community Land Bill proceedings—and Section 22, which tells us what development is. But if we were dealing with material development, that has the meaning assigned to it by Clause 7(7) where material development for the purpose of this Bill is defined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we cannot leave the matter there because on page 98 Schedule 4, paragraph (51) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"To the extent that any of the following activi-
	<span class='label label-info column'>170</span>
ties constitutes development, they do not constitute material development for the purposes of this Act".</p></blockquote>
There is then a whole list of items which are not material development for the purpose of this Bill and which I suppose, therefore, are not material development either for the purpose of deciding what is a project of material development or for deciding the current use value of land or the development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It becomes even more confusing on the next page, where paragraph 7 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The classes of purposes mentioned in paragraph 5(1)(	<i>f</i>)above are the following".</p></blockquote>
We turn back to 5(1)(	<i>f</i>) giving one of the exceptions to material development, so, any change in use which falls within a class in paragraph 7 is not a change of material development. That is perfectly clear from the wording of Schedule 4. It says it is not a material development for the purpose of this Act. If we take Class B for example,
	<br><blockquote><p>"Use as an office or retail shop"</p></blockquote>
and I gather that retail shop has sometimes been said to include a licensed restaurant. It appears that if an office is turned into a licensed restaurant it would not be a change of use which is a material development for the purpose of this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How are we then to interpret Schedule 1(2) (	<i>f</i>) to which the amendment refers? It reads
	<br><blockquote><p>"any change in the use of any land, where that change constitutes development".</p></blockquote>
We are told that the specified operation is something which starts material development, so we must assume that this means material development here. If we look elsewhere in the Bill for a definition of "material development", we find that it does not include many changes set out in the classes on page 100.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether I am right in the premise that "development" means the same as "material development", I do not know. If it does not, then I am even more confused. One goes round in a further circle. At any rate, in previous legislation of this type, we have dealt only with changes of use which are a material development, and therefore can be identified as something which affects the development value and ought to bring about, set the trigger of the liability for this tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I offer a possible solution. If it is not material development, it may be such a minor development that it has no effect on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>171</span>
development value. But I am not sure that that is the answer, because we are here dealing merely with a project. According to the rest of the Bill, Schedule 1, which sets out the projects, has nothing whatever to do with the valuation of the property or the amount of development value in the property. If one starts a project of change of use, one may also have done certain acts which are not material development as such but which are then brought into the valuation of current use value and market value after that. I am merely asking for paragraph (	<i>f</i>) to be cleared up and for us not to be left in this puzzled state of having to go round and round to find out what "development", "material development" and change of use is when it is defined in so many ways in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Prime Minister himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) was mentioning a few of the Departments concerned with retailing. It would also, of course, be necessary to bring in the Scottish and Welsh Offices which have a particular interest in this
	<span class='label label-info column'>172</span>
matter. But we are particularly glad to see my hon. Friend here this afternoon, and his normal explanatory gifts have made this schedule so much clearer to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) and to the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) for the kind and warm welcome I was given. I am not sure that I can live up to the kind comments of my hon. Friend about explanations, but I shall certainly do my very best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to the invitation that my hon. Friend extends to other Ministers, I am sure they will all be delighted to join in the detailed discussions of some of the technicalities, but my hon. Friend will be aware of the pressure of time that burdens so many of my colleagues in the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I might revert to the amendment and the request by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) for a 	<i>de minimis</i> provision for the change of use, whenever anyone talks of 	<i>de minimis</i> provisions in taxation a chord of agreement is set off in all of us. We all want to make the administration of tax matters as simple as possible and to ease the burdens of the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue and free them of some of these small matters which can clog up the machinery unnecessarily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But my hon. Friend is aware, and he mentioned it himself, that, since we exempt the first £10,000, that is a very substantial 	<i>de minimis</i> provision in itself. It means that only substantial changes of use and, consequently, very substantial increases in development values are going to be taxable. He suggested that perhaps a 	<i>de minimis</i> provision of something less than 10 per cent. cubic area increase might be one such 	<i>de minimis</i> provision, but I am sure that he will be aware that where there is change under mixed office and commercial development that can be up to 10 per cent. in square footage terms in floor space before a material change is made for development land tax purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) referred to the change of use as a specified operation to decide when development has commenced under the 1974 Act. I am sure that no one is aware more than the right hon. Gentleman that the official Opposition did not take exception to that change of use being regarded as such a specified operation to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0661">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>173</span>
decide when development has been commenced. It was a reasonable view for them to take, and it is reasonable that we should take it now. It is every bit as much an increase in development values when the use of any particular building is changed than when such a building is erected, and there is every right that such a change of use should be taxable, no less than when there is development of the kind that we have been discussing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Crosby puzzled by the words in sub-paragraph (	<i>f</i>) dealing with change constituting development. He asked why that was not deemed material development. There is a simple drafting explanation which I hope the right hon. Gentleman will accept. If he does not, I shall be happy to write to him or undertake to explain it to the Committee. The wording is purely a drafting matter and does not prejudice the taxpayer because, as I am sure that he will appreciate, there can be no project unless there is some material development. Therefore, we accept the point made by the right hon. Gentleman about the necessary relationship between the project and the material development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do I understand that "development" in this context means material development? Is the Financial Secretary saying that it cannot be a specified operation unless it is one in which material development is being carried out, so that when we talk about development in this sub-paragraph we mean material development? That takes us on to the class uses which say that the change of use within a class is not material development. I presume that that is accepted by implication when one comes to the later schedules.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. My understanding is the circularity produced by this because Schedule 4 deals with material development. What we are doing in this subparagraph is making sure that the taxpayer is not prejudiced unless there is material development. I hope that my explanation meets with the right hon. Gentleman's satisfaction. If he would like to take up the definitional point further, I shall be happy to assist. But I suggest that there is agreement about what the Government intend, and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will accept my explanation</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>174</span>
	<p>6 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we are getting a degree of agreement on this matter. I am still puzzled, from the drafting point of view mentioned by the Financial Secretary, as to why in the Land Commission Act it clearly says "material development" in this context, whereas in the Bill the word "material" is left out. Will the Financial Secretary look at the subject again to see whether it would not make the matter clearer, or less open to doubt, if the word "material" were to be inserted, making the phrase "where that change constitutes material development"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This would make it clearer that the simplification of the user classes, to which I referred, applies. My right hon. Friend, too, talked about this, and it appears in the Bill, on page 100, in Schedule 4. I suggest that that would clarify the matter, but I hope that the hon. Gentleman can say that we are as one, at least in intending that they should apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can certainly give the hon. Gentleman that assurance that the taxpayer is not prejudiced because there is no project without material development, and this part of the schedule refers to the project in the way that I think he would accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of what the Financial Secretary has said, and unless, on further scrutiny, or advice from other quarters, we have further doubts, I shall not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 12, in page 70, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Provided that the person chargeable to the tax shall be entitled to elect by notice given to the Board before commencing any of the operations described in the paragraphs (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) above, which one of these operations shall be the specified operation".</p></blockquote>
I apologise for being absent from the Committee's deliberations so far, but this has been due to other duties on a Select Committee of the House. This is a reasonably simple, but fairly important amendment. For different types of development there may be different points at which the start actually takes place. The amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0662">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>175</span>
ment is to make it clear that, rather than whichever actually comes first necessarily being decisive, the taxpayer should have the right to elect which of them should be decisive. This may be essential if the site development is held up by difficulties over, for example, road bonds or services being provided by statutory undertakers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of services being provided by statutory undertakers, as my hon. Friends and hon. Members on both sides of the Committee will know, these are often not carried out by the developer at all, but are carried out by nominated sub-contractors of the statutory undertaker and are therefore not in the control of the developer. We believe that this is a reasonable amendment, giving the right of election on what is basically an important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I looked at this amendment I did see certain reasons for it, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for enlarging upon them. But the effect of it, like that so many other amendments, would be to postpone the start of the collection of the tax by electing which of the operations should mark the commencement of the project for DLT purposes. As on so many other matters—and I understand the reasons—the consequence would be a later point of charge. This, I am sure, will reflect a number of amendments yet to come covering much the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand what the hon. Gentleman is trying to do, namely, to give the developer, or those acting on his behalf, the option of choosing which of these ranges of specified operations he desires to use. As the Government have specified in this Bill a number of such choices, it might be held to be not unreasonable that it should be up to the taxpayer to decide which of these he elects to take. The trouble is, of course—and perhaps the hon. Gentleman will accept this—that a developer could well nominate one of those specified operations which, in effect, is never ultimately carried out, and it would be very difficult indeed to ensure that this was done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a need, and we are all at one on this, for clear and precise rules, and we have this in much of the legislation that went before. But if the developer himself nominates one of the specified operations on which he then proceeds to move as
	<span class='label label-info column'>176</span>
cautiously as possible, but on the others he can proceed with very great speed and efficiency, we could find ourselves in a situation where no tax would be payable because one of those specified operations was never, in fact, actually finished. This is the reason why we are unable to accept this proposal, quite apart from the other reasons that I have tried to set out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his reply. This is a difficult matter. I can see certain parts of it to which we would wish to return at a later stage. I can see ramifications, for example, where the developer does not own the land but the landowner is disadvantaged as taxpayer because the developer makes a start on the site. This, I understand, is common in commercial development, with the details of which I am not familiar, although it would not be the case in house building, with which I am.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is easiest if I take an example to illustrate what I want to say on this matter—a large development, a development of a substantial number of houses, for example, which are to be phased through a period of perhaps 10 years over an area of land. It may be of great convenience at the early stage to put in the roads in that development. If that is done, the developer—as I read the schedule as it stands—will become chargeable with the tax on the development value of the whole estate which he is to develop, not over a year but perhaps over 10 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point which the Financial Secretary has made about the choice between the four paragraphs here, and that if the developer, for example, chose the roads as the specified operation there might be no roads to build, so he might go on without his liability ever descending upon him. However, if one merely amended the amendment in a simple way—and I think, Mr. Fitch, you will allow me to show how this amendment might be effective and so meet the difficulty which the Financial Secretary saw—to give an alternative between (	<i>a</i>) on one hand and (	<i>b</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) on the other, the liability, if the developer so chose, would not fall on him until actual construction started on the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It will raise considerable problems where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0663">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>177</span>
developers of large estates wish to phase out the development over a period of years. They may be able to do that by applying for planning permission for only part of the estate, and phasing it in that way. But the developer wants some certainty of his plan for phasing, and if he has arranged that phasing with the planning authority he ought to be able to phase his projects in accordance with the commercial way of phasing the development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not only in the case of the house builder developing a large estate, but it particularly applies to trading estates, where developers are building factories, perhaps on speculation. That is surely a desirable form of speculation, and I do not say "speculation" in this case in any derogatory fashion, because the Government have encouraged the developers of industrial estates to build factories on speculation. They commonly lay out the whole of the estate, with roads and drains, and intend to build their factories over a period of time as demand may occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yet, in laying the roads on a site of many acres, they may well be charged with the tax on development value of the whole of that site at the very outset. Even though there may be postponement of the payment of that tax for a year—even though it may be spread over eight years by half-yearly instalments—it will be an inconvenience, at least, to the cash flow in the development of that estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not putting this forward as theoretical. I can give the Financial Secretary the names of developers of a trading estate who put this point to me. They see a great difficulty in continuing that development in future—"those developments", indeed, for they are developing a number of trading estates. In fact, they have been urged by the Government to build the factories as people require them, sometimes even custom built for the client. If on every occasion they are to be told that, because they are putting the roads down or the drains in for the whole of that estate, they are to be liable for the tax on the development value of the whole of that estate right away, it will be a very great burden and deterrent to them in doing exactly what the Government want them to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) gave from
	<span class='label label-info column'>178</span>
his experience and personal knowledge an example of the development of houses. I was pleased to hear that he accepted the point that was also accepted by the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) concerning the choice, which if provided to the developer might mean that certain of these projects and specified operations would have lower levels of priority as a result of the tax system. Of course, this would be an obvious distortion which neither we nor the Opposition would wish to see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member suggested an amendment to his own amendment. I am always pleased to hear of any changes, and I think I understand the main points to which he was referring. He was concerned about the very large scale projects, which going along with all the various specified operations would involve considerable cash-flow problems. I understand that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the cash-flow problems that such development would generate, one naturally expects, quite apart from the tax considerations, to see a fair degree of phasing of such an operation to ensure that there was at least some sale from part of the project before final completion. It is very rare—indeed, if it happened I should have thought it would be attributable more to bad management than to sensible planning—to proceed with the whole of an estate, whether it be private housing or commercial development, without seeing some cash-flow before the completion of a project of this size.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is this kind of phasing, which the right hon. Gentleman saw fit to accept, that phasing in itself would fit in with the development land tax provision. The projects themselves would be divided in the same way that the phasing of the projects were divided: that means, development land tax would become payable only at the beginning of the material development of each of the phases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could go further. There is no reason to say why any particular phase should not be sub-divided into various material developments. I grant that there is something to be said for doing the whole road as one operation, but it may well be that for that particular developer to see the road put in at an early stage would
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0664">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>179</span>
mean a very substantial sum of money expended against which there is no return for a long time. My experience is not as extensive as the right hon. Gentleman's, but it suggests that it is not always that one sees the roads part of the development right in the forefront.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are many cases, from an economic and commercial point of view, where it may not be right to put all the roads in right away. An even more difficult case would be if one had 100 acres, where the sewer is down one end and one wished to develop the other end, which initially may be the right place to develop. One must then put drains in the length of the 100 acres to the sewer. Consequently, one will be charged tax on the development value of the total area because one has put drains into the whole area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Though that might apply in the odd case, the expense of building a road to accommodate it might be offset by other methods of construction. However, I must bow to the detailed personal knowledge of the right hon. Gentleman in such matters. This does not affect the main case that I was making about the way in which these projects can be divided, not only for the benefit of the tax but also for the benefit of the project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman referred, and I am grateful to him for so doing, to the fact that there was no tax. As a result of this legislation, no tax will be payable on commencement. As he knows, tax on a deemed disposal will be spread over eight years or 16 half-yearly instalments, with the first year being completely free of payment and of interest. Although one can look at a wider range of developments, this is not an unreasonable arrangement, bearing in mind the kind of development that is not peculiar or has particular problems that one might be able to devise, but at least as far as the generality of development is affected, it is a reasonable attempt at a solution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I will be happy if I am wrong on this point—and the Minister will correct me if I am—but does this not mean that the chargeable person is precluded from referring the matter to the commissioners unless he can say that there was no evidence on which the Board could be satisfied? In short, that it had not exercised a discretion and that it reached its decision without any reason, logic or evidence? If the person thinks that the Board is wrong in the decision—in law or in fact—from the use of the words "the Board are satisfied" it appears that he cannot then go to the commissioners and argue that they were wrong, either on fact or in law, because the answer will be that the statute says that something shall be if the Board is satisfied on such and such a matter.

This occurs in several places and I am not sure whether these four amendments cover all the cases in which that phrase is used in Schedule 1.

In setting out a new tax of this sort, where there will undoubtedly be a number of issues between a chargeable person and the Revenue which fall to be decided, if they were then to be decided by the opinion of the Board, it would be unfair on the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It seems to me that the problem is that if the view most disadvantageous to the taxpayer is the right interpretation of the words "the Board are satisfied", it must mean inevitably that the taxpayer can only seek redress by going to the Queen's Bench Division and saying that there was no evidence upon which the decision could have been reached. In my submission, that would be a very onerous position in which to place the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anybody who has ever been involved in any form of a motion to the Queen's Bench Division knows that it is both a lengthy and expensive procedure in which inevitably the appellant has to show that there is no evidence upon which the court, against whose decision an appeal is made, could come to such a conclusion. The cards are heavily stacked against the appellant. We take the view that if the more pessimistic interpretation of these words is the right one, the taxpayer is being put in a very unfavourable position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the attention of the Committee to the concluding words of Clause 4(5), which relate to determining the realised development value accruing where apportionment is involved. They provide that the method of apportionment adopted shall be such as appears to the Board or, on an appeal, to the Commissioners concerned to be just and reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like to know why, if the Government do not wish to accept the amendments which my right hon. Friend has moved, there should be a particular difference in this case. Naturally, we hope that such an appeal would be available in all the cases concerned, and, if this is just a discrepancy between the procedure offered in different cases, we hope that consistency could be achieved by accepting the amendments moved by my right hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>182</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and the hon. Members for Melton (Mr. Latham) and for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) have pinpointed the problem. What the right hon. Gentleman says is, with respect, quite correct, as one would expect it to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I first take Amendment No. 17 with Amendments Nos. 21 and 22, and leave Amendment No. 44 to be dealt with separately, because they are slightly different. In Amendment No. 17 the words in the legislation referred to are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Board are satisfied that"</p></blockquote>
whereas in the other two amendments the words are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it appears to the Board that".</p></blockquote>
However, I am advised that, in practice, there is no difference, and that these words mean that a taxpayer could not appeal against the determination of the Board unless he went to the Queen's Bench Division, to which we would not want to send him because of the problems and difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am further advised that these words mean that the taxpayer could not appeal against the determination of the Board, even before commissioners, when questions of assessment were being debated and appealed. Therefore, these words exclude most rights of appeal, as indicated by the right hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should first explain the position under Amendment No. 17, which deals with paragraph 2 (3). We are concerned with a situation where the developer, after having given a date of notice of material development, which he has chosen and sent a notice to the Board, subsequently wishes to change that date. He writes to the Board saying, "I do not want to abide by that date. I want to start development on another date". If the Board is satisfied that that is correct in the circumstances, it will allow the later date to be the determinable date for the purpose of commencement of material development. But if the Board is not satisfied, it has the right of veto, and that right cannot be appealed against.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the other two amendments, because the same type of issue arises. These two amendments relate to two different situations. The first would be where the taxpayer gives notice of additional development, having already given notice of development, and the Board
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0666">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>183</span>
wishes to challenge that notice of additional development because, in its view, it is not additional development but a new project of development. In most cases the Board would accept the notice of additional development, but there might be cases where the Board felt that it was not additional to the original development, but was a completely new development. Again, the Board can give notice to that effect within a period of 60 days, and the Board's decision is final.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 22 refers to the alternative situation where a developer gives notice of a new development within three years of the original notice of the last development, and the Board may wish to challenge that on the basis that it is an additional development and not a new development. That position is unlikely to arise, but the Board must have these powers to safeguard the Revenue. Once again, there is no right of appeal to that determination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been considering this matter, and we are concerned about the difficulties. We have no wish to deny the taxpayer the right of appeal, but the difficulties in such a situation are to know at what point to introduce into the operation the right of appeal. It might be possible, as suggested by the right hon. Gentleman, to have the right to appeal when the Board informs the developer that it is not satisfied. At that point the developer might be able to go to a special tribunal, or to the commissioners, to deal with the matter. This has been done previously in legislation, but is not entirely satisfactory because it takes more time, creates another appelate procedure, is cumbersome, and can cost money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'> 	<i>rose—</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. Let me finish. That is one way in which it can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another, better way, which is to ensure—and we shall see to this when we look at the legislation again—that the taxpayer can challenge the determination of the Board when the assessment is raised, in accordance with the normal appeal procedures. In other words, when the taxpayer receives his assessment of tax for the development he can challenge not only the assessment but the determination of the Board in relation to these matters. That
	<span class='label label-info column'>184</span>
gives him a right to argue the case to say that the Board was wrong, when it was satisfied that something happened when it did not happen, or that a date was right when it was not. At that point it is more practical to allow the taxpayer to have the right of appeal. We think that is better than setting some kind of appellate machinery at an early stage which might be more cumbersome and cause more difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the Minister did not give way and that he expanded his argument further. The only point that passes through my mind is what advantages are there to the taxpayer in having a full right of appeal at a later stage? One would think that if the taxpayer did not have the right of appeal written in at the earlier stage—the stage which at present is effectively being denied to him—it would mean that he had to pay the money rather earlier. Perhaps I am putting this too self-confidently. I wonder whether there is a disadvantage to the taxpayer in allowing that right of appeal in relation to a later part of the procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I was not clear, but the taxpayer would not have to pay the money at a later stage. He would have to pay the money after an assessment and after all the appeal procedures had been determined. If he receives an assessment for a certain amount of money he can then appeal to the Commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall ensure in the legislation that on the appeal against that assessment the taxpayer can raise all the other matters about the assessment. He can also raise the determination of the board in regard to these matters. He has a right of appeal to the Special Commissioners or the general commissioners at the moment of assessment. Tax does not become payable until the assessment is finalised. We believe that that is a better and more practical way of dealing with the matter than setting up some special way of dealing with it at an earlier stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman is happy with that assurance, we shall look at the Bill and bring forward the necessary amendments to ensure that that is the case and that the taxpayer is not denied a right of appeal. I agree entirely that he should have a right of appeal in these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0667">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>185</span>
I now turn to Amendment No. 44 which is slightly different in that it relates to a different situation. The wording is different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is
	<br><blockquote><p>"if it appears to the Board to be appropriate".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 44 relates to what might happen if there is a variation of a particular development. There may be an additional development or a variation of a development. If there is an addition to a development, the original tax payable on the commencement of the first part of the project may have to be recomputed because of the additional development, the additional development being additional to the original project. There might have to be a recomputation of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of a variation of a development, it might turn out that a development was smaller than originally was envisaged when it was started. There might be a variation of that development and less tax may be payable at the end of the day because a smaller development was carried out. Thus there may be a situation of more tax or less being payable. In most cases of additional development more tax would be paid, although certain situations might arise where less tax was payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These words are put into paragraph 6(4)
	<br><blockquote><p>"if it appears to the Board to be appropriate"</p></blockquote>
with the intention of obviating the necessity for the Board to recalculate in detail a situation where the taxpayer might have to pay a little more tax, a pound or two possibly, as a result of an additional development. These words are included to enable the Board to forget that extra pound or two—the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) smiles—but otherwise there would be a duty upon the commissioners of Inland Revenue to collect the extra tax if the extra tax was due. These words are put in to give the Board a discretion not to collect that extra tax. I should have thought that was perfectly proper. It saves manpower. It makes it slightly less bureaucratic—something which I would have thought the Opposition would applaud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all right, and I am sure hon. Gentlemen will agree. This wording exists earlier in the Schedule, in paragraph 4 at the end of sub-paragraph (3). These words could also apply to a situation where tax was due to the taxpayer, perhaps just a pound or two. Again, as the Bill is drafted, the Board has a discretion whether to carry
	<span class='label label-info column'>186</span>
out that computation. It might involve a lot of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have decided—and I hope the hon. Gentleman will accept this assurance—that in cases where tax is due to the taxpayer, albeit a pound or two as the result of a recomputation, we should not give the Board a discretion to recompute that, but the Board would, in every case, have to do the recomputation which might take a lot of time. Since the taxpayer is entitled to the money, we think it is right that that should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I would also prefer to keep the wording in the legislation because it would obviate the necessity to do a recomputation where money was owing from the taxpayer but where, in fact, it was a small amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We would not then have to go through the whole procedure of detailed computation. We should prefer the words to remain in the legislation, but we give a clear assurance that they will not apply in relation to money owing to the taxpayer, however minute those sums might be, and on every occasion the Board will have to do a computation and pay back the money. On the other hand, if this was money owed by the taxpayer to the Revenue—especially a small amount—the Board would not have to collect that amount. These words give the Board a discretion to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the first three amendments, therefore, we shall amend the legislation to ensure that there is a right of appeal through the normal process of appeal against assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to Amendment No. 44, I give the assurance that if any tax is due back to the taxpayer, however small the amount, it will be paid and the discretion will not apply in that situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my right hon. Friend comments on the Minister's remarks, I wonder whether the Minister could clear up one small point. I listened carefully to what he said at the beginning of his speech about Amendment No. 12, during which he gave the impression—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not refer to Amendment No. 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 17, I am sorry. When talking about Amendment No. 17 the Minister gave the impression that there would have been a second exercise by the developer; that he had put
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0668">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>187</span>
forward his notice with the date on it and in some way he had changed it, or proposed to change it. That is not how I understand sub-paragraph (3). It seems to me that the Board could object, under sub-paragraph (3)(	<i>b</i>), to the original notice served under paragraph 36 of Schedule 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose for example, the developer said, "I started my site on 2nd August" and the Revenue said, "It was not 2nd August. You actually started on 10th August and you are trying to get out of eight days of tax, and the value has changed in that time." That is where the question whether there should be a right of appeal at that time arises. It is clearly a vital matter to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that the developer had his rights and the Government will see to it that there is proper appeal on an assessment notice, but that may be too late. All sorts of things may have changed in that time and the developer will want to know of any different liability at the earliest possible moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister tell me whether I am right in my assumption that under the wording of the paragraph as it stands, the Revenue could challenge the original notice given under paragraph 36 of Schedule 8? Secondly, will he think again about the earlier question and appeal on that point? After all, there may be years between the start of a site and the actual paying of tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) on this point. It is not clear to me that under sub-paragraph (3) the Board can move only when there is a new notice. It seems to apply to the original notice and that the Board has complete discretion to tell the developer that it will take another date for the commencement of the specified operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are much obliged to the Minister of State for having given such careful consideration to these amendments and for having put forward a proposal to meet them—at least, half way. The Board must be given the right to challenge something that is first within the choice of the person who will be charged to the tax and say that he has not given the right date, or that a project said to have been started on such and such a date did not start on that date and the same kind of
	<span class='label label-info column'>188</span>
point applies to the other amendments. We are clear that there should be the possibility for the Board to raise this issue with the chargeable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that there would be difficulties in giving a right of appeal in this case. There are difficulties with all appeals. Whatever conviction, decision or judgement is given, it is troublesome to appeal against it. With any form of taxation, it means a delay in collection of the tax, but in this case, unless the appeal is taken at the time the issue arises and the Board says it is satisfied with one thing or the other and comes to a decision, it may be that the whole date of assessment will be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens under this provision is that at the date of the specified operation starting a deemed disposal takes place, and therefore one has to value the current use value at that time, on the assumption that the property is disposed of immediately the specified operation starts, and is reacquired at the same moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a different date is chosen—and these dates could be a year apart—the whole assessment under the original notice may have been carried out at considerable expense not only to the person to be charged but to the Revenue in carrying out that assessment. If an appeal occurs shortly afterwards, and if the appeal is successful, the first assessment may have been purposeless. It is a great disadvantage to the taxpayer if there is to be a considerable delay between his becoming chargeable and being able to question that charge. It is a disadvantage to the taxpayer not to have this right of appeal but instead to have the proposals put forward by the Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, in a case like this, we would like to see the terms of the amendment. It may be a solution to the problem, and at least the Minister has recognised that the taxpayer should not be deprived of right of appeal, that the Board should not be dictatorial in deciding some point which affects the taxpayer's liability, and that the taxpayer should not be denied the right to question that and go to appeal, either to a special tribunal or to the Commission, although I do not see the need for a special tribunal in these cases. If the taxpayer is to be entitled to question the assessment this may be a solution, but it is not as good a solution for the taxpayer as having a proper right of appeal. However,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0669">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>189</span>
I shall be happy to look at it when we see the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come how to Amendment 44. If the Minister were one of the Commissioners, or on the Bench of the High Court, as no doubt some day he will be, I should be perfectly happy, because he has given us an assurance that this will be treated in a reasonable way. If a taxpayer is claiming back some money, the Board will compute it and pay out the money. It is all very well to give an assurance of that sort in Committee. I am not certain how the hon. Gentleman intends to carry it out. I do not know whether he will do it by means of an extra-statutory notice. This works satisfactorily in many cases, although it is often stuck up in the corridor of the Inland Revenue office and nobody knows about it unless he walks down that corridor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is carried out in some form like that, so that the Revenue and anyone skilled in taxation will know about it, that is all right. We can accept that firm assurance. It is not satisfactory, of course. Extra-statutory provisions to deal with tax matters are not satisfactory. I should like it all set out in a statute or in an order made under a statute, but I should not go to the gallows on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is important about all these amendments is that the Board could have stated a date for certain things to happen, and those certain things might be vital in the liability for tax. Suppose the taxpayer wishes to bring his development into one financial year because he is somewhere near the 	<i>tranche</i> of £150,000, or he wishes to get the advantage of £10,000 at the lower end of the scale. The date of the start of his project may be vital to whether it comes into one financial year or another. If he cannot get it into one financial year because of the dates, he will feel very aggrieved if the Board decides over his head that the date is so-and-so and therefore he cannot get the benefits under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that what the Minister suggested will turn out to be satisfactory. We shall certainly study it carefully when it is brought forward. I do not know whether he has any further point to put on Amendment No. 44. Having seen little notes pass along the Front Bench, I shall sit down before I make any request to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have nothing new
	<span class='label label-info column'>190</span>
to say, but perhaps I should deal with the point raised by the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). He is quite right. I did not mean to give the impression that only the developer could take advantage of sub-para 3(	<i>b</i>). Of course the Board could challenge a date but, in practice, that is not how it will operate, and that is not how we intend it to operate. We intend it to operate in such a way that the developer will be free, within certain limits, to choose his own date and to choose his own project. That is how we think it should operate, contrary to the operation of the betterment levy, where notices and counter-notices made it much more complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case, we hope and expect that the provision will be operated much more simply. Sub-para 3(	<i>b</i>) would help the developer more than the Revenue, because it would enable the developer to say that the date he first chose was not the right date and that he wished to choose another. But when he chooses another date there arises the question of appeal, and we have dealt with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept what the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) says, that it might be more satisfactory in some cases to have a pre-trial or pre-assessment appeal to the commissioners. On the other hand, that would depend upon how soon an assessment was raised. I understand that an assessment would be raised fairly quickly after the commencement of material development. The lapse of time must be taken into account when we look at this. If there were a long period of time we might have to think again, but at the moment I am fairly convinced that this can be dealt with through the normal machinery. However, I take on board everything that the right hon. Gentleman said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to Amendment No. 44, I do not know how the assurance would be carried into practice, whether by extra-statutory concession, or otherwise, but I assure the right hon. Gentleman that it will be operated in practice. The other alternative would be to delete the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"if it appears to the Board to be appropriate",</p></blockquote>
but that would mean that we would have to do a recomputation when more tax was owing to the taxpayer, with all the bureaucratic work involved in that operation. I am sure he will appreciate that this kind of assurance will be carried out in whatever mechanical way it is communicated to the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0670">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>191</span>
taxpayer and his advisers. In those circumstances, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for those undertakings. We shall look forward to seeing how they are put into operation in the Bill at a later stage. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 35, in page 70, line 40, leave out 'the carrying out of'.—(	<i>Mr. Dell.</i>)</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 31, in page 71, line 4, after 'granted' insert 'after 12th September 1974'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of this amendment is to remove the danger of a possible double charge to taxation by insuring that development land tax would apply only to cases where temporary planning permission had been granted after the date of the White Paper "Land", 12th September 1974. Such temporary planning permission granted before that date may have been treated as permanent planning permission under the betterment levy rules and taxed accordingly, so the renewal of temporary planning permission could give rise to a further charge to tax under DLT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I imagine that the cases concerned when this clause was drafted were expected to be things like storage areas or temporary buildings. I wonder whether it is really intended to cover notional gains resulting from the continued use of temporary buildings? At the very least, we believe that a project of material development should constitute new buildings, or a change of use of existing buildings, not the continued use of existing buildings for the same purpose. We believe there could be considerable problems of assessing valuation in such a kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to raise a question on the wording of paragraph 3(	<i>a</i>). It reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"where</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) any material development is carried out on land in accordance with planning permission granted for a limited period".</p></blockquote>
That reads as if it were the planning permis-
	<span class='label label-info column'>192</span>
sion which was for a limited period rather than the benefit of it which was designed to be restricted for a limited period. The possibility of inserting some other words such as "the planning permission granted for the use of buildings for a limited period" or something to that effect might make this clearer if that is the intention of the wording of the clause. Perhaps the Minister who replies to this could also comment on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to exempt the renewal of a planning permission granted for a limited period from giving rise to a project of material development if the original planning permission was granted on or before 12th September 1974. In other words, if planning permission has been given before 12th September 1974 for a limited period, this amendment would seek to exclude the renewal of that planning permission, the new one taking place after the operation of legislation, from the charge to development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a reasonable amendment. Representations have been made by the House-builders Federation on this and, in view of that, and as it is reasonable and sensible and gives no scope for avoidance or tax evasion, I am prepared to recommend that the Committee accept the amendment in the form in which it is drafted.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
