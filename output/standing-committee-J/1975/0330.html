	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed—[25th March]—</i>No. 5, in page 2, line 30, leave out from '(	<i>b</i>)' to end of line 31.—[	<i>Mr. Ian Stewart.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are also discussing Amendment No. 30, in page 2, line 42, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>c</i>) the market value on the date on which the project is begun does not exceed £20,000'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was in full flight when the last sitting of the Committee was adjourned. We were dealing with Amendment No. 5, and from this fairly modest, and perhaps rather technical, amendment some rather important points had emerged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the cost of collection of development land tax, the percentage of that cost of the whole amount which it is visualised will be collected, and he then gave the total he thought should be collected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I specifically set that out in that order, because it was significant that the Minister gave those details in that order. I quote from our last sitting, when the Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The total cost of operating this tax would be about £4 million a year. That includes the cost of the DLT office which we are setting up, and also the cost of valuation, which might be over and above the specific costs of the office … the cost of collecting this tax is slightly above that of income, corporation and capital gains tax".—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee J,</i> 25th March 1975; cc. 81–82.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister said that the cost would amount to 2 per cent. of the gross receipts, whereas the figure for collection of income tax, and so on, is 1.74 per cent. and the cost of collection of death duties is 2.37 per cent. Only when pressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), with a brilliant mathematical
	<span class='label label-info column'>96</span>
calculation on his feet which surpassed anything that I could possibly achieve who said that 2 per cent. and £4 million meant that the total collection was £200 million, did the Minister agree with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That seems a strange way to put the matter round. We are going to spend £4 million on the collection of a tax. We want that to be 2 per cent. of the gross receipts, so we shall collect £200 million. Perhaps I am teasing by putting it that way, but that is how it sounded from the way the Minister gave the figures. In fact the £200 million was only dragged out of him by my hon. Friend the Member for Hoveso that we might know what the gross figure was.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister must tell us a little more about this. Was he taking the first year, when he said that the cost of collection would be £4 million, which would be 2 per cent. of £200 million which it is expected to collect? I think he was probably giving some year after the first, when the process of collection had built up. How far ahead was he taking this figure, and is it an average as from the second or third or fourth year of collection of the tax? It is very important that we should know that, and whether, in calculating the £200 million, he has taken into account the tranche of £150,000, on which only 66⅔ per cent. of the development value is to be collected, not the full 80 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In short, we wish to know the amount of tax to be collected over the next three years because those are the important years. We assume that after that this tax may no longer be in existence, but we should allow the present Government a period of time for the purpose of debating this tax. I think the period of time we are concerned with is a matter of three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other point I should like to raise which arises out of the amendment, not on the question of the amount of tax, but on the assessment of major interests. What we are dealing with in this amendment is a definition of major interests and, indeed, the listing of interests which will not be major interests on which the tax will be payable on a deemed disposal. I imagine that here we are talking, particularly in paragraph (	<i>b</i>), about easements, restrictive covenants and that type of interest in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand Clause 2, it means that the owner of such an interest is assessed to the duty when the deemed disposal occurs—that is, when the project of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0621">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>97</span>
material development is started. I should be grateful if the Minister could tie this up with the provision in Schedule 1, Part II, on page 74, where, in paragraph 8(2), the property—that is, the property which is subject to the deemed disposal—is valued without consideration of these interests in the land. They are listed as easements, restrictive covenants, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning back to Clause 2, we are told that the owners of those interests will become chargeable on the development value of those interests when there is a deemed disposal. On the face of it, that seems to mean that there is some form of double taxation. Under Clause 2 the owner of the major interest—if it becomes a major interest under paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>)—will become chargeable when a project of material development starts, and in Schedule 1, Part II, the owner of, let us say, the freehold or the developer is not to take that into account in the assessment of the development value on which he becomes chargeable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure I am not right in saying that there is double taxation here, but I am hopeful that the Minister can confirm that. On the face of it, it looks as though both the owner of the I use the example of the freehold and the owner of an easement may be charged for the same right in the land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal first with the point regarding the cost of collecting this tax? We said quite clearly on Second Reading how much we think that it will cost to collect this tax. I qualified all my figures with the point, which I believe has been accepted by the Opposition, that when one is dealing with a tax involving land it is extremely difficult to come to a firm estimate of the amount of revenue that will be raised. We said that within five years we hope that it will be between £200 million and £300 million, which will be somewhat more than under the present development gains charge proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I then said that the cost of collection would be about £4 million and the extra staff required would be 200 to 300 at Middlesbrough and about 400 extra clerks to deal with valuations around the country. I gave £4 million as the cost of collection, excluding any local authority incidental costs. When the tax is more or
	<span class='label label-info column'>98</span>
less fully in operation, the percentage cost of collection will be about 2 per cent. In the early days costs will be greater because receipts will be less. I made it clear to the Committee that it will take some time for the tax to build up, but, when it does, that will be the order of percentage cost to revenue. I do not think there is anything unusual in that; it happens with all taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also tell the Committee that, with the development gains charge coming to an end, fewer people will be needed to operate the charge. We estimate that when the charge comes to an end—and there will be certain transitional and overlapping provisions—100 fewer staff will be required within the area of income tax, capital gains tax and what is now the development gains charge. The figure of 200 to 300 I gave for the increase in staff for development gains tax does not take into account that reduction of 100. As I have said, these figures are not out of line with other costs of collection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) asked how much revenue would accrue in three years' time. I would be foolish to give such an estimate, because it takes time for these matters to be decided.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's reticence about giving accurate predictions of the amount of revenue that will be raised in three or four year's time. Is he saying that costs in three or four year's time are also uncertain?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, not at all. The costs are not at all uncertain. The initial costs and later costs will not be very different because, as revenue increases, costs will stay more or less the same. The amount of work involved in tax matters is not commensurate with the amount of tax collected. One could have a small amount of tax collected, but the computations and the work involved might be considerable. Very often the work involved in collecting small amounts of tax is greater than that for large amounts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that point, but surely there is a close correlation between the number of staff and the cost of collecting the tax and the number of cases from which tax has to be collected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>99</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think I have made the position clear. I cannot go into the matter any further. I have given all the figures available, based upon our best estimates. Perhaps Members opposite should tell us how much it would cost to collect their special tax. Presumably their special tax would not be very different from ours, except that their rate might be 60 per cent., 50 per cent., or even 30 per cent., judging by their past performance. If they had a rate of 30 per cent., the cost of collection would not be any different.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman then raised a point about the interaction between Clause 2(3)(	<i>b</i>) and the basis of valuation set out in Schedule 1. He made the point that when valuation is carried out certain incumbrances are not to be taken into account. We accept that, on the face of it, there appears to be some discrepancy between the two. We have discussed this during representations and it would be best to leave this matter until we come to the schedule. I accept that there appears to be an inconsistency. There is no intention to impose a double taxation charge and if it is found, after debating the schedule, that this may be so we will put the matter right. We have had representations and we are continuing to discuss the matter. If the right hon. Gentleman is content with what I say, we will return to the matter when discussing the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two amendments would, in effect, increase tax exemption. Amendment No. 5 seeks to increase the exemption from tax in relation to all those interests in land covered by subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>). We think this goes too far. I accept entirely that certain rights of light would not be worth much. Indeed, that is why—I will give way to the hon. and learned Gentleman in a moment—we put a figure of £5,000. No doubt rights of light relating to burgage properties in Scotland are valuable, but generally those rights are not worth much. On the other hand, restrictive covenants and rights of way relating to development land can be valuable. We have put the figure at £5,000 because these valuable rights can then be brought into competition and we think that they should be taxed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not intend to interrupt the Minister, but as he has given way may I say that I think that the absurdity is raised by the fact, which perhaps the non-lawyers amongst us do not
	<span class='label label-info column'>100</span>
appreciate, that a person who lives in a property will have to pay development land tax if his neighbour develops his land. He has, what is called in Scotland, a negative servitude, or a number of negative servitudes, in that land, and one of these is the right to light. I can think of no more important or valuable characteristic—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. and learned Gentleman making a speech or asking a question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interruptions should be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certain negative servitudes may be taxed. Is aid that in most cases they will not be taxed as they are not very valuable in relation to developments. But if one person has a restrictive covenant or a right of way on adjoining land, the hon. and learned Gentleman cannot seriously say to the Committee that that valuable right should not be taxed if it exceeds a certain figure. He may disagree about the figure, but he cannot say that the restrictive covenant, which might be worth a large amount of money, should not be taxed. In most of the smaller negative or positive servitudes, which might be worth less than £5,000, there would be no problem. In most cases they would be worth less than £5,000, but there might be some, for example, a restrictive covenant, which might be worth a lot more. Subject to the exemptions of the legislation, and the £10,000 exemption, we suggest that they should be taxed. But in most cases no tax would arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 30 goes even further and seeks to exclude all interests where the value does not exceed £20,000. We think that this amendment goes too far. As a result of representations we have raised the exemption limit from £5,000 to £10,000 in the legislation. We have introduced the first tranche of 66⅔ per cent. up to £150,000. We think that this is a reasonable and generous way of dealing with the matter, and we do not agree that there should be a further £20,000 exemption. As the amendment is drafted, the £20,000 exemption would relate to every operation and every development. Both the £10,000 exemption and the slice
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>101</span>
exemption are cumulative, but as the amendment is drafted a person could get a £20,000 exemption. Every time there was a development, £20,000 would be knocked out. We think that that goes too far. We consider that the exemptions in the Bill are sufficient and that most people and organisations would accept them as such.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that basis, Mr. Fitch, I ask the Committee not to accept Amendment No. 5 or Amendment No. 30.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, at any rate, the Paymaster-General has not kept the promise made on his behalf by his Welsh colleague that he would explain to us the effect of the law of Scotland. That promise was—
	<br><blockquote><p>"I will leave the points on Scottish law"—</p></blockquote>
as it is here called—
	<br><blockquote><p>"is my right hon. Friend the Paymaster-General". —[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee J,</i> 25th March 1976; c. 80.]</p></blockquote>
I do not know if that promise was given on the authority of the Paymaster-General or whether it took him by surprise. All I can say is that the Welsh version of Scots law is so unsatisfactory that it would be of great benefit to the Committee if we could have an English version as well. Apparently we are to have an English version as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Committee should realise the principle that there are at common law rights in land, in one's neighbour's land, a principle which in Scots law is called negative servitude. If there is a right to cross another person's land, that is known as positive servitude. But negative servitude, as the hon. Member said, is a right, for instance to light. If the clause remains as drafted, it means that if I am sitting in my own house and Mr. Harry Hyams decides to put up Centre Point at the bottom of my garden, and I then have to sit for ever virtually in the dark and if it is the case, as it will be with many properties, that the value to me of being able to have light in my house as regards selling the house or living in it, is more than £5,000, because somebody else develops his property I shall have to pay tax for a diminished house of my own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If Mr. Harry Hyams were to pay the hon. and learned Gentleman £200,000 for his right of light, is the hon and learned Gentleman suggesting that he should not pay tax on that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>102</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But Mr. Harry Hyams is not going to pay me £200,000 for my right of light—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Then the hon. and learned Gentleman will not have to pay tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would not my hon. and learned Friend agree that were Mr. Harry Hyams to pay him £200,000 for his right of light, that would presumably reflect—no pun intended—the diminution in the value of his "castle" due to the loss of light that has followed from that development? On balance he would be no better or worse off in respect of the value of his asset. Therefore, there should be no question of his paying tax on the £200,000, but he would not be £200,000 better off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: But I suggest that it is important, if I read the clause correctly, that people's interests may become taxable without their receiving any funds. I ask the Paymaster-General to delineate what the Government think that subsection (2) means in respect of Scotland. What do the Government mean by the phrase "feudal property"? They must know—and I should like to know. Is burgage property included? What is non-feudal property? What is the
	<br><blockquote><p>"interest of the proprietor of the 	<i>dominium utile—"</i></p></blockquote>
I submit that it is important that these questions should be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unsatisfactory to say that, if we pass the Bill, a court will have to sort out the matter. The Government should know what they think they are saying. There is a tradition in the law, certainly in Scots law and I imagine in English law, too, that a person is not permitted to analyse what Parliament had in mind when it passed its legislation. There is a duty to read the legislation and to interpret it in law by what it says. The tradition is that one is forbidden to refer to the intention of Parliament. That being so, it is important at this stage that the Government should tell us what they mean, so that we may judge for ourselves whether what the Government say means what they intend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be obliged if the questions which I asked—they are reported in column 79 of 	<i>Hansard—</i>could be answered by the Paymaster-General, so that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>103</span>
he underwrites the promise made by his colleague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Crawford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support what the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) has said. I should like to ask him and the Paymaster-General whether they would not agree with what I said on Second Reading, that the Bill should not apply to Scotland and that the Matter is one for the Scottish Assembly as and when that Assembly is set up.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can satisfy the hon. and learned Member that a fellow Celt is probably as good a person as any to explain the ramifications of the Scots land law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me, first, put his mind at rest. We intend to tax his burgage property, whether it is valuable property or not I do not know. Burgage property, as the hon. and learned Member will know, is a form of ownership of land in Scotland. It was granted originally—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does it mean?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman should not ask questions from a sedentary position. If he does not know what it means, I will tell him. I am surprised in fact that, as an hon. and learned Gentleman, he does not know what burgage property is. I should have thought that that was one of the elementary principles of Scottish law which he would have learned with his mother's milk. but evidently he has not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Burgage property is a form of ownership of land which related to the burgh originally. It was a royal grant and it is no different from other forms of ownership of property. The hon. and learned Gentleman shakes his head, but he cannot expect me to go further than that. Perhaps he should tell me what is his version of burgage property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairburn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not that I do not know what it means, but I want to know if the Minister knows what it means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have just told the hon. and learned Gentleman that it is a grant of land, granted very often to a burgh, which was then subinfeudated by the owner of the grant to various people living within the burgh, and that is why it is
	<span class='label label-info column'>104</span>
called burgage property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me come back to the phrase 	<i>dominium utile</i> which, again, is a form of ownership of land in Scotland which basically confers almost all the rights of ownership, except that the owner of the 	<i>dominium utile</i> would have to pay some kind of rent service or payment to the owner of a superior 	<i>dominium.</i> In effect, it is the ownership of land subject to that payment of some kind of feudal due which would be owing to the owner of a superior 	<i>dominium.</i> Again, in Scotland, there was not the benefit of the Statute of Quia Emptores, as the hon. and learned Gentleman knows very well, and so the principle of subinfeudation has applied and is one reason, perhaps, why Scots land law is sometimes a little complicated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Labour Party has been trying to abolish the feudal system in Scotland for many years. One can now buy oneself out. Does the land remain feudal if one does so? Will the Minister also tell me why burgage property is not properly defined by him as land which is held direct to the Crown and, by that definition, is not feudal?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having spent two sittings of this Committee on Scots law I can see the wisdom of the proposal by certain members of my party that we should abolish feudal property in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member asked me also what was property other than feudal property, and on this I have a note. I am sure he will understand all this. Apparently property which is not feudal property in Scotland is udal land and allodial land. Udal land is land in Orkney and Shetland which has not been feudalised—they are more progressive in these matters than on the mainland of Scotland—and is enjoyed free of all burdens of services or periodical payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I explained, the owner of a 	<i>dominium utile</i> is subject to feudal payments, which is why he is not in the same position as the owner of a fee simple in English law. If the hon. and learned Gentleman has some udal or allodial land, he will know that he does not have to pay any dues to any feudal lords. Allodial land, I believe, is more or less the same and is owned outright and absolutely so, again, it is presumably not feudal property. That is why we draw the distinction between a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0625">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>105</span>
property which is other than feudal property and the contra-distinction with 	<i>dominium utile.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that satisfies the hon. and learned Gentleman, although I am sure it will not. I think I have dealt with most of the points on the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister sits down, may I question him on that point, because it is important? If that is the distinction the Government imagine they are making, then why, in a situation in which one redeems one's feuduty and is therefore the superior oneself, is that still feudal land, if no dues are owed to anyone? Secondly, as burgage property is 	<i>ipso facto</i> defined as land held direct of the Crown on which there are no dues or rights, why is that not, like udal and allodial land, exempted on the word "feudal"? I just do not understand the distinction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the hon. and learned Gentleman is not really understanding the clause. I do not think it is a question of Scots law that concerns him. The main thing here is that major interests are taxable, subject to these exemptions. I have explained what these exemptions mean, what 	<i>"dominium utile"</i> means—he obviously did not know before he came to the Committee—what "burgage property" means and, what land in Scotland can be, other than feudal property. If he is still not satisfied, I can give him a few references to books on Scots land law which no doubt would help him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to try to gather together some of the threads of discussion on the two amendments which we have considered this morning and at the last sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I begin by congratulating the Minister of State on the homework he has done since then. Certainly I found some of the wilder flights of Scots law a little difficult for a non-legal exiled Scot like myself to understand, and I wondered—it also occured to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page)—whether this udalling law in Orkney and Shetland—it sounded like "yodelling"—includes crof-
	<span class='label label-info column'>106</span>
ters' rights, if they would come under this definition. That is another of the points we ought to clear up before we leave these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Originally I took the two amendments in reverse order, taking No. 30 first, so perhaps I could begin with some comments on that. Of course we understand that the Government may have a different view from ours of the way this tax should be administered, but it is a bit rich for the hon. Gentleman to say, just because the Labour Government have brought forward a Bill in this form of such appalling complexity, that any other Government would necessarily do the same. Yet every time we table an amendment to make it a bit more simple to administer, or to exclude a few marginal items by 	<i>de minimis</i> provisions, the Government put up a stone wall and want none of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said at our last sitting—this is at columns 85–86 of the 	<i>Official Report—</i>that if a market value exemption of £20,000 was to be allowed, then added to the £10,000 exemption this would give a total figure of £30,000. But that is not so. If the market value of £20,000 applies, then unless the property had no current use value at all the development gain would be a much lesser figure than £20,000. I generously suggested to the Government that we were not absolutely fixed on a figure of £20,000, but we wanted to raise the subject. I said we might go for a figure of £19,500. My right hon. Friend was much more generous than that, so we have come down to £10,000 or £15,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is one of principle. In order to reduce a large number of small deals which may otherwise have to go through all the processes of valuation, we feel that it would be sensible to introduce a 	<i>de minimis</i> provision in relation to market value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has perfectly reasonably pointed out that this could lead to problems of splitting up property, and indeed I conceded that in moving the amendment, because we on this side recognise the problems. We are not trying to do anything unreasonable. All we are proposing is that the cost of administration of the Bill when enacted could be reduced if a further category of exemption relating to small market value was included in the provisions, so that all the business of producing two valuations in each case under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>107</span>
the deemed disposal procedure could be avoided in such instances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether these should be cumulative, and therefore there could be a higher figure, or non-cumulative with a lower figure, we would leave to the Government. As a matter of principle we feel that there should be an exemption of this kind in the Bill. That is our purpose in tabling the amendment. We accept that it would need certain consequential changes, but we do not accept that they need be complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think we have had a satisfactory answer from the Government on Amendment No. 5. It is an attempt to reduce the time, energy and cost involved in deemed disposals. I emphasise that because, in an interjection a few minutes ago, the Minister of State argued that, if Mr. Hyams—that legendary figure in all our discussions—were to pay my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) a large sum of money for infringing the light of his property it would be right for it to be taxed. Perhaps it should be taxed if money changes hands. But the point about deemed disposals is that money does not change hands and the owner of the easement, the right of way, the way leave, or whatever it may be that is a restrictive covenant, will not receive cash out of which to pay the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We ask the Minister again: how can an unexercised restrictive covenant give rise to that sort of valuation? How can a right of way which is not enforced or infringed give rise to a tax change of this kind? If it is bought out there is an actual charge but, if not, how can the owner benefit financially at all?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said last week that such a right
	<br><blockquote><p>"could be very valuable in relation to a development of building land. We do not see why owners of these very valuable rights—common, ordinary rights—should be allowed any exemption over and above what is in the Bill … A restrictive covenant worth £100,000 or more would be completely</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>exempt"—[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee J;</i> 25th March 1976, c. 87.]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>—that is, if my amendment were carried.</p>
	<p>But it would not be worth £100,000 unless it applied and restricted the specific development to which the project of material development related. How could it? It may be that a right of way which is not infringed by that particular development might subsist in the hands of a long-term owner like a City livery company for centuries, and which might apply at some future date to a subsequent structure on the property.</p>
	<p>The Minister has failed to give a practical example of what he has in mind. We propose something that will not produce any windfall gains to anybody. By definition, under a deemed disposal, no money will change hands.</p>
	<p>If the Bill goes forward as at present worded, every time some easement or right of way is involved it will be necessary to go through all the processes of notional valuation, both for current use value and for market value, to establish whether it is worth £4,500 or £5,500 and whether it is caught under the provisions of the Bill. I shall not persist, because I hope that the Minister will explain what he means. We believe that a deemed disposal for this notional interest in land is quite different from an actual disposal in which consideration passes in the form of cash. In those circumstances, one knows the market value. But as the Bill stands, there is no means of distinguishing that. We believe that it would simplify the working of the Bill if the figure of £5,000 could be forgotten and interest in a restrictive covenant or an easement could give rise to tax only if money actually passed and a value was established.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 8, in page 3, line 5, leave out 'fifty' and insert '20'.</p>
	<p>No. 9, in page 3, line 14, leave out 'fifty' and insert '20'.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All these amendments relate to the reversion on a lease, and the value of the reversion depends upon the length of the lease. Whether that reversion is a major or minor interest depends on the length of the lease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to reduce the 50 years to 20 years on the basis that if one has a reversion after as long as 50 years there is little value in that reversion arising out of the development of the property. If it is 20 years, I concede that there is a likely value in that reversion and, therefore, likely development value if there is a deemed disposal of the leasehold interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To a great extent it is a matter of opinion where the point falls. I should have thought that the surveyors' and valuers' opinions at the present time is that it would be an interest worth considering as a substantial interest only if the reversion is after 20 years, but that, once one goes beyond that, there is little value in the reversion and, therefore, it could be removed as a major interest which has to be assessed and on which the owner becomes chargeable on the deemed proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one minor point on the amendments. They all relate to a different phrase used in the Bill as drafted. In the phrase to which Amendment No. 6 refers the wording used is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"does not exceed 50 years".</p></blockquote>
In the phrase to which Amendment No. 8 refers it is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"of less than fifty years".</p></blockquote>
"Does not exceed" and "of less than" are not the same thing. In the third case, to
	<span class='label label-info column'>110</span>
which Amendment No. 9 refers, there is a different phrase altogether. That says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a term exceeding fifty years".</p></blockquote>
Apart from the fact that the draftsman in one part of the Bill uses the figure 50 and in another part uses the word "fifty", and I thought there should be some consistency in that at least, there is not consistency in the phrases used to describe the period of 50 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have not attempted to amend those phrases, because I am not sure which the draftsman, or the Government, meant in drawing up the clause. When one turns to the very useful Explanatory Notes which I suspect were copied from the Department's instructions to Parliamentary Counsel, undoubtedly the Department left Counsel in great doubt here by saying that subsection (5)—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Prescribes that certain leases are to be treated as granted for terms of less than 50 years."</p></blockquote>
So we are not given very much of a clue as to what is intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple point. We think that a value in a reversion should not be treated as a major interest unless it falls into possession within 20 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to support my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), for two reasons. The first relates to the cost of collection. My right hon. Friend pointed out that interests on reversion longer than 20 years are likely to have pretty small value resulting from any redevelopment, and the costs of assessing the tax on such interests will be disproportionate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second and more important point is that I am sure that the Government would not wish to do anything to discourage redevelopment. There is a strong argument that the whole approach of the tax is such as to do just that. But perhaps we could try to minimise the discouragement in any way possible. One way would be accept the amendment or, if the Government came back and said 25 years, I am sure that my right hon. Friend would not quarrel with that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty for the occupier on a long lease is that, if he believes that economic use of the buildings is poor and that it would be advantageous to redevelop all or part of the premises—I am thinking particularly of industrial or commercial premises—and he seeks the agreement of his landlord, he will find, if we leave in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>111</span>
50 years, that in a large number of cases the landlord is concerned. The landlord may be an institutional or charitable body. Whereas perhaps the landlord will be able to get an increase in rent, it will not be of much help to him if he has to pay a sizeable capital sum in tax at the time that the redevelopment commences. When the landlord looks at his institutional cash flow, he will find that he is out of pocket in year one, and possibly for a number of years, until the increased rent which he can reasonably demand meets the tax payment for which he is asked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, this is likely to lead to the landlord asking for a much larger increase in rent for giving permission to the redevelopment. A further complication is that negotiations between the landlord and the tenant will have to take place before the level of the tax has been determined.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I support my right hon. Friend in his argument for 20 years in this case. Unless we have a reduction we shall have a more costly tax to collect and there will be complications in landlord and tenant relationships which will discourage necessary redevelopment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. Could you give me some guidance at this stage? On earlier amendments several hon. Members have raised the question of administrative costs. I did not do so as I did not know how far it was possible to raise the matter without your stirring in your chair. Would you indicate whether you will take a reasonably broad view on the Question "That Clause 2 stand part of the Bill"? If so, I wish to raise the matter then. If, however, you feel that discussion on the clause has proceeded far enough, I may wish to catch your eye at an earlier stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are other amendments to be taken on the clause and I think that I have taken a very liberal attitute to the debate generally so far.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) rightly said that the amendment dealt with the problem of whether the reversion on a 50-year lease should be in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal with his two specific questions. He referred to the figuring at the top of page 3. He asked if 50 should not be
	<span class='label label-info column'>112</span>
written as "fifty" rather than the figure "50". I understand that in the Bill when enacted it will be written as "fifty". I hope that the right hon. Gentleman is happy on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point the right hon. Gentleman raised was that in the first line on page 3 it is stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>… the lease does not exceed 50 years;"</p></blockquote>
and that later it states
	<br><blockquote><p>"for terms of less than fifty years".</p></blockquote>
If the lease does not exceed 50 years, it is for a term of less than 50 years, and there is no inconsistency, although on the surface it may appear so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the main point made quite fairly by the right hon. Gentleman, that it is a matter of opinion as to where one draws the line in relation to the length of the lease. He said he thought that a lease of less than 50 years would have very little value these days, and that possibly this was the generally accepted view in the valuation business. I would not dissent wholly from that, it is difficult to arrive at a proper figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has always been thought that with leases which exceed 50 years the reversion in such cases would be worth very little, but below 50 years the value of the reversion increases, although I would accept that it does not increase rapidly until the figure goes down to 30 or 25, As one goes below 50 there is a gradual increase in the reversion, but above 50 there is very little value in most cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that 50 is not universally accepted as the right figure. I also take the point made by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) about the difficulty with a deemed disposal that might arise through a reversion, and the need, if we keep it at 50, to bring more people into the net, as it were or to see what their interest would be. Again, a lease of 49 years would be worth very little in terms of development value in most cases, although there might be one or two instances where that was not so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am quite prepared to accept what has been said in the Committee—namely, that a figure other than 50 might be better. I do not wish to make any commitment, but we will certainly discuss the matter again with the bodies concerned to see whether it might not be fairer to introduce a lower figure. I want to make clear that I am not making a commitment, but we will look again at it genuinely, accepting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>113</span>
what has been said, to see whether it might not be right to lower the figure from 50. I do not think we will be able to go to 20 years, but we might be able to accept a figure somewhere in between. Therefore, I hope the right hon. Gentleman will accept that we are not dogmatic about this. We accept that there are problems and we shall try to deal with them after consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said. If he is again consulting professional bodies and his own advisers in Government offices on this, we also would like to consider it again with those who have advised us on a figure of 20. I would also hold to a figure of 20 while saying that I will certainly take further advice, as will my colleagues, about whether we can come to some compromise. But I am extremely grateful to the Minister for what he has said, and on the assurances he has given, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 7, in page 3, line 4, leave out subsection (5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be less than gracious of me to be ungrateful to the Minister for his commitment on the last amendment, and I should hate to push him back upon his intentions. But subsection (5) has obviously less relevance the lower the figure in subsection (4) and the preceding subsections. I am anxious to discover on what basis the Government think it right to make an arbitrary definition which is differently applied according to the different legislation in Northern Ireland, and, I take it, according to English common law, and certainly common law in Scotland? I take it that the Government have in mind particularly leasehold property rather than agricultural land, and buildings rather than land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to remember that the concept of leasehold property is not a practice in Scotland, therefore, in all leases determinable on death—I take it that that means terminable on death and not determinable; I do not know why the word "determinable" has been chosen—
	<span class='label label-info column'>114</span>
why, in leases in any of the three categories which can be determined by the life or lives of a person or persons, should it be arbitrarily assumed to be of a lease for less than 50 years or whatever will be the figure?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I take the case of agricultural land, and another important matter—the Minister shook his head on the previous amendment—a crofter's rights, which may terminate on the death of the crofter. The Minister did not seem to think that the subject would be included under the previous subsection. I do not entirely understand why it should not be. What would be the situation in respect of agricultural land and crofters' rights? I cannot enlarge upon the matter until I have heard what the Government say, and their justification for arbitrarily saying that a lease shall be treated as granted for less than 50 years if it is terminable on death. I ask the Minister to give an explanation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may briefly outline the reasons for subsection (5) and the background to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once it was decided to draw a distinction between major interests and those not major in terms of reversion, and that a figure of 50 years—I accept there may be arguments about the figure—was the right figure to choose, because on a lease that exceeds 50 years the reversion is worth little by common consent, we were faced with the problem of dealing with life leases. These are not common only to the law of Scotland. As the hon. and learned Gentleman knows, they have existed in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England and Wales, as well as in Ireland. The apparent complexity of subsection (5) is due to the different treatment of leases for life in the three constituent countries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In England and Wales a lease for life is now treated, as the result of the Law of Property Act 1925, as a lease for 90 years, determinable by notice given by the landlord or tenant. We did not consider it right to leave the position different in respect of leases for life. Taking England and Wales, a lease for life would not, for the purposes of the legislation, be treated as a 90-year lease, but would be deemed to be a 50-year lease and then a major interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should not expect leases for life to last longer than 50 years, although there might be arguments on that score. If we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>115</span>
did not choose a figure such as that proposed, we should become involved in all sorts of actuarial calculations on length of life, which would make the Bill even more complicated than it is. We considered that the best way to deal with the matter was to equate one with the other and say that in most cases a lease for life would not be likely to extend more than 50 years. There might be cases in which it did, but a certain amount of certainty is needed in land and taxation matters. That is why 50 years was chosen. I shall return to the question of what happens if we reduce the figure below 50 years as a result of what I said on the previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have spelt out for Scotland that a lease is determinable on the death of any person. I understand that the word "terminable" would be adequate, but I am told that "determinable" would be better understood in Scotland. That is the advice we have from the Scottish parly draftsmen. Therefore, the provision says that a lease of land determinable on death would be converted into a major interest as a lease of less than 50 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first part of the subsection deals with Northern Ireland, where there were perpetually renewable leases. These are converted into fee farm grants which, in effect, are fee samples with payment of rent or service to the owner of the reversion. That equates the position, so that in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and in England these leases for the purpose of the legislation are treated as a lease of less than 50 years becoming then a major interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we reduce the figure below 50 years, because of what I said on the previous amendment, we are in difficulty. I accept that it would be the Government's difficulty. Do we then use the lower figure for a lease for life? If we accepted the figure of 20 years, it might be said that the lease for life for the purpose of the legislation could not be reduced to 20 years. That is a consequential problem that would arise if we reduced the figure. There is nothing sinister in the provision. We have merely tried to equate a lease for life with the reality of the situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The laws of Northern Ireland, Scotland, and England and Wales are different. That is why we have spelled out the provisions for each. But if we change the figure of 50 years in respect of the previous amend-
	<span class='label label-info column'>116</span>
ment, we shall have to think again about this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I make a serious suggestion to the Government on the progress of the Committee in relation to the amendment and to future amendments? I suggest that it would be of considerable value if the Government asked the Lord Advocate to attend the proceedings, which I believe is possible under the rules of the House. I suggest this course in all seriousness, not to waste the Committee's time. My hon and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) is a distinguished Scottish lawyer and, rightly, he is picking up numerous points relating to Scottish law which are entitled to detailed answers in respect of the Bill's application to Scotland.

The Minister of State is a distinguished Welsh tax counsel. Clearly he can answer the first series of question posed by my hon. and learned Friend, particularly if he comes armed with a brief. But if my hon. and learned Friend puts further questions, plainly the hon. Gentleman is not equipped to deal with them. He is not trained to do so—he would be the first to admit that. The Minister could say only that he would write to my hon. and learned Friend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be worth the Government's while asking the Lord Advocate to attend the Committee. We are writing into the law of Scotland important new law provisions, and it is right that they should be properly examined by the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to be in the presence of the Lord Advocate, and I should be more than delighted if he were to join the Englishman and the Welshman on the Front Bench. We should then have full representation, even though the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford), representing the Scottish National Party, is so rarely with us. That is almost inevitable, as he appears to take no serious interest in the law of Scotland, which has been one of the few things which has kept Scotland in a state whereby the existence of Scottish Nationalists is possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister for his remarks, but my initial reaction—it was probably the hon' Gentleman's, too— is that in the event of there being any change in subsection (4), subsection (5) would have to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>117</span>
re-drafted: let us take three score and ten as the lifespan and 21 as being the age at which, for certain purposes at any rate in Scotland, one begins to enter the 	<i>quadriennium utile</i> which I know the hon. Member will understand. That is a useful thing if the Minister does not know what it means. It is the four-year period of one's life when one can enter into contracts and get out of them if they do not suit one, but stay in them if they do. Very few people know about it except lawyers and we do not disclose these secrets to our clients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think subsection (5) would have to be redrafted because 50 years is a sensible equivalent of a life interest and any lesser period would not be. Given that the Minister has undertaken to look at subsection (4) and the period there, and at subsection (5), as being dependent on it, and understanding that he would feel it necessary to requalify subsection (5) if subsection (4) was altered, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The words relate to the lease for life which the clause says is
	<br><blockquote><p>"determinable by notice … at a time after the death of the lessor or any other person".</p></blockquote>
The next sub-paragraph (	<i>c</i>), referring to a lease of land in Scotland, says that it is
	<br><blockquote><p>"determinable on the death of any person".</p></blockquote>
There is, perhaps, a discrepancy here in the phraseology which I suggest is not quite correct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Minister will be considering subsection (5) carefully with his consideration of subsection (4) and it may be completely redrafted. I am, therefore, merely calling attention to the point which could be taken into consideration in the redrafting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is too restrictive to say that the notice which could be given under a lease for life would take effect at a time after the death of the lessor. I believe that it could take effect at the time of the death and, in order to explore the point and call the Minister's attention to it, I suggested the words "by reference to" instead of the words "at a time after". I cannot quote any firm authority for using those words,
	<span class='label label-info column'>118</span>

are taken from Section 149(6) of the Law of Property Act 1925. That subsection converts leases for life of this kind into a lease for 90 years determinable by notice then given by either side after the death. The words have been taken from that legislation and are words which the courts understand, because they have been pronounced upon in the past and lawyers and people dealing with these matters are familiar with them. I am not convinced that the wording which the right hon. Gentleman seeks to substitute is superior. I think the present wording is better because it is clearer and hallowed in the sense that it is in the property legislation. We think that the present wording is better, but, in the light of what the right hon. Gentleman has said, we are happy to look at it again. It is a drafting point and if we find that the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 33, in page 3, line 25, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7) Nothing in this section shall apply to house-builders registered with the National House Builders Council'.</p></blockquote>
This is an amendment of great importance. It deals with the position of private householders and their relationship to the deemed disposal procedure. The purpose of the amendment, whether rightly drafted or not, is to say that private housebuilders shall be outside the deemed disposal procedure and that they will not have to pay development land tax at the time when they begin their estates. The Paymaster-General will know that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>119</span>
private housebuilders registered with the National House-building Council means, in effect, all private housebuilders except for an insignificant percentage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are asking for advance payments on a notional gain which might or might not be realised. If the point of taxation remains as drafted in the Bill as the commencement of material development, many developers, particularly those on larger sites—I have already declared my interest as a director of Lovell Homes, which firm builds several hundred houses a year—will seriously have to consider the viability of a good number of schemes. At a point in time when such developers actually have to increase their borrowing to pay for roads, sewers, work in progress, and so on, they will be asked to pay a tax which will cause them to incur even heavier financial liability. The cost of such an exercise may well be too risky to undertake and may well result in fewer houses for sale and a corresponding increase in house prices in a restricted market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point of great importance to me as a builder is that payment at the outset of material development makes no allowances for changes in the market—drying-up of mortgage funds, material and labour costs increases, and so on—nor does it deal with the volatile and flexible nature of the house-building industry. I cannot stress too strongly that taxation at the end of material development, be that defined as a detailed phase of a project or the whole scheme, is absolutely vital if the industry is to flourish. It is also vital from the valuation viewpoint and I shall say something of that in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is difficult to understand what will be achieved by a deemed disposal by the method outlined in the Bill as drafted. Payments, it is intended, will be delayed and paid in instalments by builders who will then have to try to arrange their project size so that payments should not become due before part of the project yields some return from the sale of houses. That is, in practice, what they would have to do, despite the difficulties I have described. Exempting housebuilders from the payment on deemed disposal, as the amendment suggests, will not lead to any smaller receipts in tax or later receipts in tax by the Revenue. The administrative gain to the Revenue and to the industry in having to assist in this administration
	<span class='label label-info column'>120</span>
will obviously be immense. If house-builders paid only on actual disposal as opposed to a deemed disposal the loss of tax would be nil, but the administrative difficulties would be saved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the important question of valuation of deemed disposals. It is because of these complications, apart from other matters which I have already mentioned, that we have put down these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Everybody in house-building is extremely concerned about the use of the device of deemed disposal at the commencement of development as the opportunity for a district valuer to determine the market price of the land for the purposes of assessing the liability to tax. I have already indicated the strong feeling in the industry about the division of the business operation into a land and a building element and their separate assessment for tax. My concern about the possible implications of this measure is heightened by the doubts that I have about the system within which the district valuer has to work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present system does not enable the district valuer to have full knowledge of all the factors which influence the market price of land. The returns, for the purpose of stamp duty, to the right hon. Gentleman's Department, provide the basic raw data but give only prices and acreages, which are inevitably in arrears. Therefore, in a rising market the valuations are low and on a falling market they tend to place higher values on land than the free market would allow. Given that the direct evidence of transactions in the market is normally the preferred basis of valuation, house builders are concerned—as, indeed, am I, as I believe the Committee should be—that they do not have equality of access to information with which to contest the valuations of the district valuer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, where a builder is able to produce examples of land transactions he will provide evidence to support his view of price, setting out those factors relating to the cost of building on the site, which would determine his view of what the market price should be. Where there is sufficient volume of open market transactions under normal market conditions, the numerical superiority the district valuer has in support of his valuations can be counted only by the number of transactions which are known to the builder and to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>121</span>
his professional advisers. They can argue their case on the basis of the considerations which will determine whether prices are comparable which they seek to use in support of their view. By setting out two different approaches a reasonable compromise can be achieved and usually is achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the present situation is not normal and has not been for a couple of years. At present, as the right hon. Gentleman knows, the market is operating at an extremely low level. The asking price of land from land vendors in some cases is still reflecting the stupidly inflated expectations of 1971 and 1972 rather than a sober appraisal of the present situation. In many cases, land coming forward for the builder has a residual value of nil at present, although land owners are still asking high prices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the implementation of the Community Land Act, there is likely to be an attenuated market, as was clear from the Public Expenditure White Paper, even if there is increased market activity. The normal open market situation does not prevail at present and the forces which would normally operate to keep the district valuer's prices reasonably in line with the market are not present. In those circumstances, the normal comparables are nonexistent or inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the alternative? The alternative available to district valuers in these circumstances is the use of residual valuaions. The Housebuilders Federation has made representations to the right hon. Gentleman about this. It is concerned that district valuers are failing to make use of the option of residual valuations and it believes that in the present and projected market situation residual valuations will be the only reasonable method of assessing market value. In reality the so-called direct evidence of district valuers in assessing the price of land comes from a secondhand presentation of the market situation by builders and others who will have paid out what they regard as the residual value. Residual values are, in any case, the only true reflection of the inherent characteristics of any particular site and those factors which most influence builders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whilst district valuers continue, in a difficult market, to use unrealistic comparables which do not reflect the
	<span class='label label-info column'>122</span>
knowledge a builder has of site costs and the final market for houses, builders will obviously regard with the greatest apprehension the situation in the Bill of deemed disposals and valuation at the start of the work. This matter has been argued at some length by the Federation with the Revenue. It is certainly not satisfied with the answers it has received so far and it is apprehensive of the whole situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to consider the matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to put a specific question to the right hon. Gentleman. It is a question which has been put to me and I should be grateful for his answer. If the right hon. Gentleman is unable to answer it now, perhaps he will write to me later. Within the general deemed disposal situation outlined in Clause 2, what is the actual position in the event of a house builder disposing of part of the land undeveloped, or of his disposing of the whole of the residue? Is the entitlement to deferment of payment retained and apportioned in the event of a part disposal? When the new owner commences his part of the development, is this a new project—a new deemed disposal attracting its own period to deferment? I would be grateful for guidance on the matter and appreciate that the right hon. Gentleman may not be able to answer that today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a complicated matter and I make no apology for having dealt with it at some length. It is of the greatest importance to the house-building industry. I cannot stress too strongly the importance of changing the present situation for the assessment of house builders. It is a highly geared industry. At present the tax is likely to accrue when the gearing is increased rather than decreased, when cash flow from sales is not yet materialising and when the builder is at his most vulnerable from the point of view of commercial viability. Many of us are having to re-assess our sites to consider the phasing of them in the light of this tax, which is leading to much abortive and tedious work, preventing us from getting on with the proper job of building homes for people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been long discussions on this matter. They have not yet come to a satisfactory conclusion, and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will be able to say that the building industry is in a quite different position to the land vendor and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0634">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>123</span>
that he will be able to meet this point by accepting the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster-General [Mr. Edmund Dell]</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) asked me a question and suggested that I should write to him to provide the answer. That will be necessary as I was unable to handle all the details of the question as he put it to me. In any case, it seemed that it might be an attempt to predetermine a lot of the material in Schedule 8. However, I will look at the question and see what answer I can give him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also discussed the question whether his amendment was correctly drafted to achieve the object he had in mind. The amendment, as drafted, would go well beyond what he has in mind. Indeed, I suspect that one of the difficulties with that sort of amendment, even if one accepts the principle, is that as drafted it would exempt more than house builders, properly so-called, from the charge on the commencement of development. A person who is a member of the National Housebuilders Council may register a single house or a number of houses with the Council. It would seem, therefore, that under the amendment the developer who was not primarily a householder could, by registering one house with the Council, gain exemption from development land tax on all his other developments which were not house-building. The amendment is not correctly drafted on that point. But, even if we were to accept the principle, I do not see how we could get over the type of difficulty I have illustrated by saying that the amendment does not really meet the point. I do not know how one could meet the point without creating a large loophole in the whole operation of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The housebuilder will frequently have acquired his land, including the development value, to the extent—and I believe that will be to a considerable extent—that the whole question will not arise. We are considering cases when there may be a development land tax liability, and that is only a proportion of the number of situations with which we are faced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's argument was interesting in that he applied it to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>124</span>
situation of deemed disposals. He did not say that land in the possession of house builders should always be exempt from development land tax. He was arguing that development land tax should only arise when there was an actual disposal, not a deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one accepts that there should be a liability on house builders in respect of development land tax, the question narrows itself down to whether that liability should arise in the case of a deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see in principle why a house builder should be exempt on the occasion of a deemed disposal. Admittedly, there are difficulties. The hon. Gentleman referred to certain difficulties in valuation and, if he is correct, these are implicit in the situation anyhow. I hope that the difficulties in valuation to which he refers can be surmounted; it is important that they should be. I accept those difficulties, but we have put in the Bill provisions to meet them. Those are the spreading provisions, which are very generous as compared, for example, with those in respect of development gains charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is the delay for 12 months; there is then the possibility of spreading over eight years, or 16 half years. It is to meet the kind of difficulty to which the hon. Gentleman refers that we have made the spreading provisions so generous. To follow the course suggested would create loopholes and difficulties of definition which could make the administration of this legislation much more difficult. Therefore, I hope that the Committee will accept that the Government have recognised this problem by including the spreading mechanism—in other words, by lightening substantially the burden of development land tax on housebuilders. That is the way we have chosen to meet the problems. I think it is the best way to deal with the matter. It avoids the danger of loopholes, and I hope the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his reply. I cannot say that I found it satisfactory in content, though naturally it was courteous in tone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman drew an assumption from my speech. He thought that because I had referred solely to deemed disposal, it must follow that I accepted that there should be a liability
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>125</span>
for actual disposals on house builders—or, rather, that I had not made the point that there should not be a liability for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would make two points in reply to that proposition. The first is that this is a clause about deemed disposals. Therefore, I thought that if I talked about actual disposals, I might get into trouble with you, Mr. Fitch, but that is by the way. Perhaps my back is broad enough to bear your strictures, and my tongue blithe enough to avoid them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I agree that where a house builder buys land and resells it in what is a speculative operation—which happens from time to time when a house builder acquires a site from another builder and finds that it is no longer viable or when another builder with a next-door site wants to amalgamate the two to have a bigger development, so he sells it on—it seems perfectly proper that development land tax should be payable, because that housebuilder is there acting as a land vendor, which is not his normal function.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I was arguing was that with the creation of a tax at point of deemed disposal, which is our old friend the trench digging operation—on which we can go back certainly to the 1967 Land Commission Act, and, arguably, to the 1947 Act; although I was not sufficiently old to be involved in the debates in the House at that time, but I have read some of them—we get all the absurdities which we shall doubtless come to when we talk about Schedule 1. I well remember at the time of the Land Commission Act, in order to avoid the trench exercise, solicitors would go with photographers to building sites, the photographer would take a picture of a spade being put into the ground, an affidavit would be drawn up saying, "This is a picture of a trench being dug on such and such a date, signed by Messrs Sue, Grabbit and Run, Solicitors", in order to avoid the date 6th April 1967, which was the operative date for that particular occasion— [	<i>Interruption</i>] I shall not pick up what my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said 	<i>sotto voce:</i> Perhaps he may wish to help the Committee in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These difficulties arise, and I think the building industry will be very disappointed at the right hon. Gentleman's reply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>126</span>
I appreciate that in my speech I was dealing with complex matters. I was talking fairly quickly and at one stage I was speaking copiously from notes, but I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will wish to read what I have said and consider the point about residual valuations. However, I feel it would be wrong to leave the matter there and at this stage I do not feel able to withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to support my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) on this amendment, but I do so with two reservations. First, it is an amendment dealing only with deemed disposal. We shall talk about actual disposal at a future date, but my hon. Friend has a very sound case on deemed disposal—namely, that the house builder should be exempt. I acknowledge that many complications are involved. There would have to be a number of provisions to avoid avoidance, if I may so put it, and the matter needs hedging round with precautions. Nevertheless, I think that there was a strong case for saying that the house builder should not be caught for the tax on a deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point on which I support my hon. Friend is based on expediency rather than logic. The Paymaster-General asked why in principle, should a house builder be exempt from the tax on a deemed disposal. I would not argue that matter in principle. There are a good many other people who deserve to be exempt from the tax on deemed disposal. But we have a particular need at present not to deter house building. I argue the question on a matter of expediency. If we can make matters easier in the payment of this tax, if one is dealing with deemed disposal only, it will eventually be paid and will relieve the inconvenience and in some cases hardship, particularly on the smaller builder, in paying this tax at the early stages of development. I think it right that we should make that exemption in the Bill itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One imagines varying cases of deemed disposal applying to the development of an estate for dwelling houses. It may be that the land is part of the land bank of a house builder, and that he is paying this development land tax on the basis of an increase in the value of land which he has kept as a land bank. In that case, he is the land owner in the same way as any land owner
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>127</span>
who disposes of his land to a builder for immediate development. But it is his land bank—his raw material—and it is wrong of us, in applying a tax of this kind, to deter him or cause him to hesitate even in progress with the development of an estate for dwelling houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the other case that one can envisage, the housebuilder may have something that is far less of an interest in the land than the freehold. It may not be part of his freehold land bank; he may not have the very major interest in the land. I presume that he could be proceeding under a building contract through some kind of option on the land or some leasehold interest. But certainly he may not have the full interest in the land and may not be actually blameworthy in Government eyes for the increase in value of the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been said so many times that an increase in value ought to go not to the individual but to the community. But let us consider the chargeable person who is not this criminal of a landowner who happens to have held land which has increased in value, but is taking an interest merely to enable development to take place. If that person finds that at the stage of deemed disposal his liability starts—even if he is given eight years to pay instalments—it is still a deterrent and an inconvenience to him by disturbing the cash flow which he had hoped to put into the development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that further consideration will be given to my hon. Friend's amendment. It is not in full form as it stands for inclusion in the Bill. But that does not justify us in failing to show the feeling of the Opposition. I hope that my hon. Friend will press this matter to a Division if the Government give no undertaking to reconsider it seriously in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that you and the Committee will forgive me for not having been present during the whole of the argument put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), but I think that he will concede that I have heard the substance of his argument before and have discussed it with him privately on a number of occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend's argument that the housebuilders should be given a special position under the development land tax is one which he has put forward before
	<span class='label label-info column'>128</span>
and one which was used by our hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) on Second Reading. It was said that there was a strong case for treating the housebuilders under the ordinary company tax provisions because the increase in land value which is being taxed is not for them just a matter of good luck. It is the result of the constant operation of their professional skill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that I find myself highly sceptical about that argument and the argument that I know my hon. Friend puts forward with great sincerity. It is difficult to see why in logic a special position should be accorded to housebuilders under the development land tax. I accept thst the system of delayed payment helps the housebuilders to some extent, but if the housebuilders find that they cannot operate under the present levels of development land tax that is an argument for reducing the level of development land tax generally. It is a substantial argument which would support our view that 80 per cent is too high and that we should have either a 60 per cent. or a 52 per cent. level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I submit that it is not an argument for giving the housebuilders a special position. If Parliament and the nation decide that the profits which arise, as I would argue, from the two factors, namely, if the granting of planning permission and the incidence of inflation are to be taxed at a special level, it is right that all persons who find themselves in receipt of those profits should pay tax on the same level. I cannot understand the argument that there are some people who are speculators who are wicked people and some people who are honest traders who are good people. It has always seemed to me that speculation was a necessary part of a market economy. I see no distinction in principle between the chap who says that he will buy a farm beside, say, West Bromwich, Bristol, or any other conurbation in the anticipation that in the future that farm may be taken for some form of urban development, and the person who decides to form a building company and a land bank with the same objectives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is morally reprehensible to speculate in land, I submit that it is equally morally reprehensible whether it is done by an individual or by a corporate body. Because
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>129</span>
an individual speculates I cannot see why it should become morally bad or morally good, but when a collection of individuals speculate does the very process of collectivising themselves make it morally better? Taken to its logical extreme, the argument is that the individual may not do something which the State may do. It is perhaps the argument put forward by the Nazi war criminals. They said "Yes, we would argue it is perfectly all right for the State to do this, but we concede that individuals should not do it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see no distinction here between the position of the individual speculator and that of the housebuilder. Both are carrying out the same activity. In logic, I cannot see why we should argue that one person or organisation should be taxed at different levels from corporate bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the argument that my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) puts forward that there is something wrong with a windfall profit because it incorporates an element of good luck. Unless one believes in the allocation of wealth by the State, we would surely have to concede that the incidence of wealth is largely a matter of luck. Indeed, it is because it is largely a matter of luck that it becomes bearable. The inequalities of wealth become bearable. Otherwise we would all have to concede that the ablest people were the richest and the poorest people were the most stupid. We all know that that is not the case. It is because of the oddities, the luck, and the inequalities of life that we are all prepared to accept the vast disparities that there are between us in terms of wealth.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

that can be controlled. I suspect that I would not be misrepresenting his views in saying that I understood that he believed in the allocation of wealth by the State. I do not believe in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. This is interesting and fascinating but it is out of order. I think that we are discussing the philosophy of collectivism 	<i>versus</i> individualism, and we have gone away from the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am drawn into that diversion by the argument that so-called windfall gains should be taxed at a higher and punitive level because they arise as a result of luck. I am simply arguing that luck in a free society is an inevitable part of the way in which people happen to have wealth. I see no reason for the incidence of luck being a cause for increased taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman introduce into his considerations something that would help us, in relation not merely to his interesting argument at present, but to the position of the Opposition generally? Can he say at exactly what percentage point tax becomes punitive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter of judgment. I argued earlier in the Committee that there was no magic in 52 per cent. or in 60 per cent. but that, as a matter of judgment, we believed that 80 per cent. was too high. From our knowledge of ordinary human beings and of people selling land—those are not mutually exclusive categories—we felt that the probability was that 80 per cent. was too high. I do not use the word "punitive". I try to avoid using it because I believe that all taxation should be primarily in order to collect revenue and should not be used as some form of punishment or fine. Indeed, I would be wholly opposed to the idea of looking at this kind of legislation as being some way of punishing speculators. The philosophy behind this tax surely must be that this is an activity and a section of the community that has wealth, and that therefore, we tax it on the basis that those who have the broadest backs should carry the heaviest burden, not on the basis of in any way punishing them for speculation, or indeed for the good luck of having made the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I am highly sceptical of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>131</span>
argument that where the housebuilders speculate through a land bank, they are any better than the individual who speculates privately. I cannot in logic see the distinction, which must be the starting point for my hon. Friend's proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I reply to the subsequent debate? The right hon. Gentleman said that perhaps his amendment was not in the proper form in which it might be put into the Bill. I do not usually raise such matters as a substantive argument against an amendment, but in this case it does seem to go to the heart of the matter. I know of no way that this amendment could be drawn, even if one accepted the principle. It seems odd that we should write into our legislation an exemption from tax arising from registration with a private body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) went to the heart of the matter. He rebuked me to some extent for referring to matters of principle and went on to refer to matters of practice, to which I shall come in a moment. But the right hon. Gentleman is perfectly right. In principle, there is no reason for the exemption which is suggested here. If the danger to which the hon. Member for Melton drew attention existed, the right way would be to reduce the rate of tax, not make the exemption which is here proposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I intervened in the hon. Gentleman's speech only because he himself used, uncharacteristically, the word "punitive". I thought that his attitude was becoming uncharacteristic of his normal objective approach to these matters. This is not a punitive tax. It is a determination by Parliament—if Parliament passes the legislation—that a certain proportion of development value should return to the community. It is not a punishment or a fine but a tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman based his argument on expediency rather than logic, in other words, not on principle, but on practice—namely, the need not to deter house-building. He gave the example of a land owner who might take an interest in the development of his land and in respect of whom a liability might arise on deemed disposal. I can only repeat that we have recognised the problem in the provisions of our legislation. We have introduced spreading arrangements. I remind the
	<span class='label label-info column'>132</span>
Committee, as we are now on matters of practice rather than principle, that the White Paper day exemption in Clause 16 in respect of stock-in-trade will mean that there will be no develpoment land tax on existing land banks of builders. There again, as a matter of practice, to avoid the dangers to which hon. Gentlemen have drawn attention, we have made an exemption. I think we have gone far enough in that direction and we should stand in this connection on the Bill as it is. The amendment is not properly drafted. I doubt whether it could be properly drafted. In any case, as it is a matter of principle and practice, we should stand where we are.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the love-in between the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen). It is for my hon. Friend to express his views in any way he wishes. I know that he sees no distinction between the operations of a builder and those of a land vendor. I do see such a difference. It was recognised in development gains tax, for example, which assessed the individual sale at income tax rates and assessed the builder for corporation tax rates. There have been other precedents in the past of special provisions being written into legislation to take account of the housebuilder and his stock in trade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was said that a builder was assessed at corporation tax rates only if he was a company and that if he was an individual he was assessed at the top income tax rate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister of State's point immediately. The majority of builders are companies, but if they are sole traders they would be assessed at income tax rates. But as a matter of hard fact the majority of housebuilders registered with the National House Building Council are companies rather than private individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman said that the amendment is defective. That may well be so. It is not uncommon for Oppositions to move amendments which are defective in form. They are trying to express on the Amendment Paper the feelings they have on a particular issue. The right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that if the amendment is accepted by the Govern-

	<span class='label label-info column'>133</span>
ment, in principle, they can then put it in their own form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not normally raise this question at all. I only said that in this case I do not see how it could be done, even if the Government wanted to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman has such a mean opinion of the abilities of parliamentary draftsmen. They have managed to produce quite remarkable things in this Bill, even relating to 	<i>dominium utile.</i> I fail to believe that the parliamentary draftsmen would not have been able to meet this point if the right hon. Gentleman had so told them. But if the right hon. Gentleman says that they cannot meet this point I must look to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), who is better than any parliamentary draftsman when it comes to drafting amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I may have the attention of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West for a moment, I should like to say that the building of houses is an extremely important social duty for which people expect to make profits. There at least I would agree with him. I should not like it to be thought, either by those who read our record or those who listen to our discussions, that the normal procedure in house-building is to buy a farm on the outskirts of West Bromwich, to sit on it for 20 years and then to make a huge speculative gain. That is not the normal procedure. It is not the way builders operate. The right hon. Gentleman knows this to be so. One of the points he made in resisting the amendment was that the majority of land has been bought by developers already at market value, with planning permission perhaps, and therefore would not be eligible for tax. The right hon. Gentleman made that point in his earlier submissions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that sometimes builders buy farms, but it is not true that the normal system is for them to have huge land</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If that is so, they will not pay much tax. Only when people have large gains as a consequence of buying at a low current use value and selling, or using, the land at a much higher level of value will they pay the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My argument is not based on whether the practice is widespread within the building industry. All I say is that where an individual and a building company make exactly the same type of profit they should bear the same type of tax. I do not know how often builders make this sort of profit, but when they do I maintain that they should bear the same amount of tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not follow my hon. Friend on the question of a matter of luck.

Friend would pause for a moment to consider the matter, I am sure that he would realise that to be true.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Despite the altercation and the opinions expressed by the Opposition on the previous amendment, the Opposition can take some satisfaction from the debates on the amendments to Clause 2. First, in proposing an amendment to the first line of the clause we achieved the removal of an anomaly in the Bill. Secondly, we won a vote on the question of taking costs into account against the consideration applicable in "deemed disposal". Thirdly, we were given a valuable undertaking that further consideration would be given to the question of the reduction in the number of reversions which would be treated as major interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fourthly, we were given an undertaking that the Government would reconsider subsection (5), and we were on such good terms with the Government that when the Minister said he would like to look at the amendment again, we were able to assure him that he was right, that we accepted his explanation and therefore there would be no need to look at the amendment again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have reached a pitch of co-operation, even on Clause 2. I hope that it will continue in the rest of the debates on the Bill. Those debates are likely to last, I fear, for a considerable time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask a question about the practical operation of the proposed law. The Paymaster-General said that to look on the practical side we must turn to later clauses and schedules. Clause 16 tells us how Clause 2 will operate on land banks. Administration is dealt with in the schedules. But the Clause 2 is based on certain impractical matters—in particular on the project of material development, which in the form in which it appears in the Bill has already been ridiculed and brought into contempt in previous legislation. From a practical point of view, I should have thought that further thought might have been given to the basis of the incidence of tax on deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have difficulty in trying to envisage how Clause 2 will work in practice. How will the owner of one of the major interests, which is not a freehold interest yet is chargeable under Clause 2, know about the deemed disposal? So far as I can see, nowhere in the Bill is there any need for
	<span class='label label-info column'>136</span>
the first, or main chargeable person, to tell anyone else with any interest in the land, anything about the project of material development, about when it is to start, and so on. It is true that under later provisions in the Bill he has to give notice about the project to the Board of Inland Revenue, but having swept into Clause 2 all sorts of what I should call minor interests which by definition become major interests, and having said that all the people owning these so-called major interests will become liable on a deemed disposal, there seems to be no way of keeping them informed or of giving them a chance to object at any stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision will cause the Inland Revenue a great deal of difficulty in collection. We might imagine one of the owners of these interests with which we dealt in Clause 2 not knowing anything about the start of a project of material development or about the fact that there is a deemed disposal. A year or so after it has all happened, he may receive a notice of assessment and a demand for payment of the tax. There is a problem in this respect, not only for the individual owner of an interest knowing when he becomes liable, but from the point of view of the Board of Inland Revenue. How will it know about the interests? The person who started the development may honestly set out in his notice to the Board that he thinks that these other interests in the property exist, but will he know them all? Will he know about all the restrictive covenants? He is under an obligation to know, but he may be unaware of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The owner of the interest may have a comparatively minor interest in the property, perhaps under a building contract, and he does not know all the interests, the owners of which may become chargeable under the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these remarks I am dealing with the practical matters which arise, both for the Board and for the owners of interests who become chargeable under the provision. Some of those problems may be solved later in the Bill. I shall not say at this stage that I have read every single word of the schedules, but I have tried to digest them, particularly with the aid of the helpful book of Explanatory Notes. I may have missed one or two points, but if I can be given some assurance on the practical side of the operation of Clause 2 I shall be much happier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>137</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said earlier that when we came to "clause stand part", because Clause 2 is concerned to some extent with the very heart of the Bill—the whole concept of deemed disposal—I should want to take up the question, which was raised at some length at our last sitting, about the administrative costs of the exercise and their comparison with the administrative costs and revenue under development gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have established a number of facts the Minister's reply—first, that the costs of collection of the development land tax will be £4 million a year; secondly, that there will be a staff in Middlesbrough of between 200 and 300 people; and, thirdly, that there will be an addition to the staff of the valuation offices throughout the country of about 400 people. Those three pieces of information were given by the Minister of State at our last sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that the revenue from the tax will be between £200 million and £300 million. I want to ask a series of questions as to how these calculations have been made, because I believe them to be pretty general and, frankly, based largely on guesswork.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 9th December 1974 I had occasion to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"how many assessments have been made to date in respect of development gains tax under the Finance Act 1974; and what is the total yield from that tax to date."</p></blockquote>
The present Financial Secretary to the Treasury replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The information is not available, but the numbers and amounts so far assessed cannot be significant."</p></blockquote>
On the same day I asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer:
	<br><blockquote><p>"how many civil servants are engaged wholly or mainly in the administration of the development gains tax; and what is the approximate annual cost to public funds of their activities, both in terms of salaries and administrative overheads."</p></blockquote>
The Financial Secretary replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Work on the development gains tax is integrated with the other work in the Inland Revenue offices concerned, and, apart from one or two people in the head offices, no one is wholly or mainly engaged on it. It is estimated that at the present time the equivalent of about 25 full-time staff are employed on development gains tax throughout the Department, at an approximate annual salary cost of £107,000—with the inclusion of administrative overheads, about £176,000."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 9th December, 1974; Vol. 883, cc. 42–43.]</p></blockquote>
That was on the 9th December 1974. Time passes, and on 12th June 1975 I
	<span class='label label-info column'>138</span>
asked the same questions again. The reply I received from the Financial Secretary was:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I would refer the hon. Member to my answers on 9th December last"—</p></blockquote>
thereby implying that the figures for revenue, which were "not significant" in the words of the Minister, were still true. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The annual salary cost, which relates solely to the Inland Revenue, is now estimated at about £215,000 with the inclusion of administrative overheads."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 12th June 1975; Vol. 893, c. 239.]</p></blockquote>
Thus, between 9th December 1974 and 12th June 1975, the revenue from development gains tax remained insignificant and the staff remained at about 25 costing £215,000 a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 17th October 1975 I pursued the matter further and this time I was answered by the Minister of State, who is with us this morning. He pointed out, firstly, that
	<br><blockquote><p>"no assessments were made before June 1975".</p></blockquote>
He went on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>"… since such assessments to tax are necessarily made a considerable time after the transactions concerned it is too soon to estimate with any degree of reliability how much tax will eventually be assessed and collected for 1973–74, and how many of the eventual assessments will relate to first letting or occupation. To date, the annual administrative costs have been very small".—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 17th October 1975; Vol. 897, c. 836.]</p></blockquote>
We know that they were small, because the Minister told us earlier that they were £215,000. A number of other detailed statements were made by the hon. Gentleman on that day with which I shall not worry the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What arises from those Questions about the yield of tax is, first, that the amount of development gains tax received so far was insignificant, and secondly that the number of civil servants involved and their administrative costs was fairly small—25 civil servants and £215,000. I am not saying that that would necessarily always be the case. It might grow as the work load grew. Nevertheless, it was certainly by any possible criterion of a different order from the £2 million and the 200 to 300 at Middlesbrough which we are promised under the development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second question I wish to raise is that of the revenue from the tax itself. As the hon. Gentleman said on Second Reading—
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0642">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>139</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"we hope that the yield will be between £200 million and £300 million."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 15th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 1059.]</p></blockquote>
Calculations of that sort can come only on the basis of an assessment by the Treasury of the value of land over the next few years. There is no other way. It is assessing some 80 per cent. of some hypothetical figure of land which it is making some attempt to calculate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To try to assess what that might be, I went back to the debates on the Community Land Bill in which several members of the Committee took part, and I looked at an Answer which was given to me on 27th March, 1975 by the Minister for Planning and Local Government. I asked him how he worked out the figures in the Financial Memorandum to the Community Land Bill, which talked about local authorities selling off the land they had acquired at an annual rate of £800 million to £900 million in England and Scotland and £50 million to £55 million in Wales, and how at the same time he calculated that the acquisition cost would be £300 million to £400 million in England and Scotland and £12 million in Wales. The hon. Member said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"These are broad estimates based on the amounts of land for private development likely to be publicly acquired each year eventually when the land scheme is in full operation—that is, after the second appointed day—to which have been applied estimated average current use and full market values for new land and redeveloped sites at present-day values. The relevant figures using broad averages covering all parts of the country and land for all types of development are:</p></blockquote>

Those were specific figures given on 27th March, 1975. They seem to bear relatively little relation to what the land market actually showed at that time, and indeed they still do. On 21st April, therefore, I asked the Minister for Planning and Local Government what the basis
	<span class='label label-info column'>140</span>
was of his calculation that the average price of building land for new development at that time was £20,000 an acre and the average price of farm land was £1,000 an acre. I asked him also what was the period of time on which the calculations were based. It will be obvious to the Committee that, if the right hon. Gentleman and, indeed, the Minister of State, had done his calculations for the yield of the tax on the basis of the price of land in, say, 1972–73, which might well have been the latest returns open to the Treasury at that time, it was quite different from the position now and from that in April 1975.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What was the right hon. Gentleman's reply? It was not as full or as detailed as one might have hoped with all the resources at his disposal. He replied that he made his calculation on the basis of
	<br><blockquote><p>"A broad assessment of recent average values for all types of land over the country as a whole." 	<i>—Official Report,</i> 21st April 1975; Vol. 890, c. 210.]</p></blockquote>
It was obvious to me that that was no good either, so I then asked another even more nagging question. On 24th April I asked the Secretary of State for the Environment
	<br><blockquote><p>"why he is not prepared to state the number of transactions on which his calculations… were based.</p></blockquote>
He replied:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This is not how the figures were arrived at."— [	<i>Official Report,</i> 24th April 1975; Vol. 890, c. 355.]</p></blockquote>
We do not know, therefore, how the figures were calculated. We do not know on which period they were based. We do not know what the sample was. All we know is that figures have been put forward and, presumably, have been recalculated for the basis of the Bill to receive a revenue potential of £200 million a year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe that those figures are accurate. First, I do not believe that the figures of £20,000 an acre for redevelopment and £1,000 an acre for farmland bear any relation to reality and, secondly, as the Community Land Act spreads its tentacles over development, the likelihood will be that, far from land prices rising and, therefore, the revenue from tax rising, more and more land will pass into the local authorities which will buy at development value and the proceeds to the revenue will be negligible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I made these points in Committee on the Community Land Bill the hon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0643">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>141</span>
Gentleman who was then Under-Secretary of State for Wales, and who is now the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs—the hon. Member for Merthyr Tydfil (Mr. Rowlands)—said, referring to my challenge on the calculations:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We shall see who is right, because calculations in the financial memorandum of any Bills which plan for the future are subject to all kinds of imponderables. We contend that these are reasonable figures; they are not plucked out of the air; they are based on all the advice available to the Government from valuations and from averages." —[	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee G,</i> 17th June 1975; cc. 1146–1147.]</p></blockquote>
What advice? On what periods? From how large a sample? With what real knowledge of the housing and land market? In particular, with what real knowledge of the housing and land market in the future, operating under the Community Land Act, not operating as in the past? There will be a situation where, as even the White Paper on Public Expenditure said, the amounts of administrative costs and the amounts of buying-in price of land is likely to be extremely expensive to the Government.

All I can see so far from the researches which I have made and the answers which have been given to the House and to the Committee is that, first, development land tax will involve more civil servants than development gains tax; secondly, administrative costs will be substantially higher; and, thirdly, the figure of yield has not so far been adequately explained to the Committee and, I believe, it has not properly been worked out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It gives me great pleasure to support my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). We have often discussed the likely movement in land prices in the future, but I regret that I do not wholly agree with him that land prices will come down.

The first proposals for the Community Land Bill, as it was, as put forward by the Minister for Town and Country Planning, were very much in keeping with the philosophy of the hon. Member for Cannock (Mr. Roberts)—the State was to become the monopoly provider of all development land. But what is interesting about the battle we fought along this Committee corridor is that we created a two-tier market in land. While I think it is right to say that as regards land acquired by the State it may be that the price will go
	<span class='label label-info column'>142</span>
down, the number of exceptions and exemptions that we fought for and, to some extent, gained, will mean that in fact the second free tier of land will go up in price. Therefore, I believe that we have, as usual, got the worst of all worlds. We do not have the free market in land that I should like. We do not have the "no market" in land allocated by the State which the hon. Member for Cannock wants. We have an unhappy compromise, and in my view because of the two-tier state of the land market we shall see that the free tier will go up quite a lot.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I thank the hon. Gentleman in advance for the support that he will give me in opposing further exemptions from the tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I am hoping to join my hon. Friend in making further exemptions so that we have not merely a two-tier but probably a three-, four- or five-tier market in land, and so mess the market around and distort it that even those in favour of total allocation of land by the State reach the conclusion that the present compromise is unsupportable.

I agree with my hon. Friend in the way in which he deals with the problem of assessing the cost of collection of the tax. He has displayed his formidable intelligence and industry in ferreting out from the Ministers some information about this. I am still uncertain about the cost of collection. The Minister of State will remember that last time we met I asked about these matters and he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I said that the total cost would be about £4 million, which include that of … the valuation office."</p></blockquote>
I wondered whether there were a mistake.
Was it
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"valuation office"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
or "offices".
	<br><blockquote><p>"I said that the eventual staff in Middlesbrough would be about 200 or 300. I understand that, in the valuation offices throughout the country there will need to be extra clerical staff of about 400."— [	<i>Official Report, Standing Committee J,</i> Thursday 25th March 1976; c. 89.]</p></blockquote>
I would like to be clear. Is the £4 million the cost of the Middlesbrough palace or is it the cost of the Middlesbrough palace with the 300 courtiers plus the 400 that are to be recruited by the local authority?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making heavy weather of this. I said
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0644">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>143</span>
clearly that the costs will be £4 million. That includes Middlesbrough plus the local valuation offices. The 400 clerical staff will have to be at the valuation offices and the 200 to 300 staff will be in Middlesbrough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry. That is how I understood the reply. When I read the 	<i>Official Report</i> I noticed that it said "the people in the valuation office" and I wondered whether that was a mistake. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making this clear to the Committee.

My final point is that the cost is also borne by the taxpayer. It is becoming increasingly obvious that the taxpayer is now being made the tax collector. Whether it be for VAT, PAYE, more and more of the administrative costs of tax collection are being shuffled from the State on to the citizen. When one sees new legislation being introduced, it is not enough to say this is what the cost will be to the State. We should like to think that some proper calculation of the cost to the taxpayer
	<span class='label label-info column'>144</span>
has been made by those who seek to impose this tax upon our fellow citizens. For instance, we should like to know what the extra cost on each individual house will be for the privilege of calculating by the builder the cost of his liability for development land tax. We should like to know in broad terms what this will cost taxpayers generally—whether they are housebuilders or private individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
