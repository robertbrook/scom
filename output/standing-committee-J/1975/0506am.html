<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 317, in page 27, line 7, after 'section', insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'including dead rents payable under a mineral lease or agreement'.</p></blockquote>
May I say, Mr. Costain, what a pleasure it is to have you in the Chair? One of the many delights of this Committee is that we have had a tour of the Committee corridor and also a wide and distinguished selection of Chairmen guiding our deliberations.<br><br>
The attraction of the amendment to me is that it enables me to start by encouraging the Minister by declaring the depth of my ignorance, which I am sure is at least the equivalent of other hon. Members and right hon. Members, in confessing a great deal of misunderstanding or lack of understanding on exactly what a dead rent is. Not following the Minister's good example when he was handed a brief and refused to read it out because he did not understand it, I shall actually read out the brief that I have.<br><br>
The brief says that this is a probing amendment to ensure that a dead rent—a minimum rent—can be included as a mineral royalty. From the wording it seems there is a danger that this may not be so, which would lead to the anomaly that, where mineral rights were granted allowing minimum rents to be merged with royalties, DLT might be payable, whereas where the rights were granted subject to royalties only these are excluded from calculations of development value and no DLT is payable.<br><br>
I feel sure that the Minister is equipped with a brief of similar clarity and will be able to answer the points.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I add my congratulations, Mr. Costain, on your coming
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 946</span>
to our Committee and assisting us with this splendid tax which we are introducing.<br><br>
Let me reassure the hon. Gentleman that dead rents will not be caught under this legislation. I understand that a dead rent is a fixed rent which is payable when minerals are not worked in any year but which normally is allowed as a deduction from royalties when working recommences.<br><br>
I am told that the meaning of mineral royalties under Section 29(6) of the Finance Act 1970 has been expanded by the provisions of paragraph 2 of the Mineral Royalties (Tax) Regulations 1971, Statutory Instrument 1971, No. 1035. So we are concerned with two statutory provisions. Section 29(6) of the Finance Act 1970 deals with the taxation of royalties which are treated partly as income and partly as capital because obviously the workings are a wasting asset, and for that reason it would not be fair to tax them all as income.<br><br>
The provisions of Section 29(6) have been expanded by the 1971 regulations to which I made reference. I am therefore told that everybody who is interested in these matters can be assured that any dead rent, or a certain rent, which I believe is also a term which is sometimes used instead of that of "dead rent", or a minimum rent or other rent of a like nature will be regarded as a mineral royalty by virtue of the Regulations.<br><br>
Again, the fear expressed by the hon. Gentleman was that a dead rent would be chargeable in fact when minerals were not worked, but since they will be included as mineral royalties, and they are included under that definition, I can give him the assurance that he seeks that dead rents will not be taxed differently from mineral royalties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for enlarging mine, and I think possibly the Committee's understanding of the nature of a dead rent it is, as so explained, fairly clear, that the expression "minimum rent" means the fall-back rent in the event of a mineral working or quarrying proceeding, and I am sure the industry will be grateful for the reassurance that that will be treated as a royalty, even if no workings have taken place in that year. Therefore, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1078">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 947</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the Minister would help us with one point about Clause 17. The first four subsections are quite intelligible, the first two dealing with deemed disposal and the next two, as I understand it, dealing with disposals which are not deemed disposals. When we reach subsection (5) on the grant of a lease, the note is brief in the yellow book. I should be grateful if the Minister could give us a little further explanation of what happens upon the grant of a lease. Subsection (5) is not all that easy to understand. It is a rather substantial subsection, and I imagine that it will apply on a good many occasions, because mineral workings are so often dealt with on the basis of a lease.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are one or two points on this clause, on which we have so far had the shortest debate of any on this Bill.<br><br>
A point that has been raised by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is with regard to the word "variations" as it appears in this clause in subsection (4). The Institution queries it and says that it takes the words to refer to an appeal to the Court of Appeal or to the House of Lords from a decision by the Lands Tribunal rather than an appeal to the Lands Tribunal. An indication of whether this assumption is correct would be welcome. I hope that the Minister will be able to give that indication.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry—did the hon. Gentleman refer to subparagraph (4) of the clause?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I am just looking for the exact places where it appears. It seems that the Royal Institution may have referred to the wrong subsection, as I cannot see the words in that subsection. Perhaps we could come back to that point.<br><br>
The other point I should like to make is that the Law Society of Scotland—this is a point which I am sure will be of interest to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn)—has said that it is concerned that Clause 17 will adversely affect the quarrying of sand and gravel industries, whether the interest in land is held by individuals, partnerships or companies.<br><br>
This is a somewhat surprising comment from the Law Society of Scotland, because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 948</span>
it was not accompanied by similar observations from the CBI or other groups interested in this activity. I suspect that the reason was the precedent set in Section 29 of the Finance Act 1970 and, indeed, the treatment under development gains tax of dividing the mineral royalty fifty-fifty as regards income and capital.<br><br>
I should like the Minister to consider whether this is the proper question. We are not dealing with a tax on income or capital—and we are all familiar with the difficulties that can arise when one tries to draw a line in that rather grey area. We are dealing with a tax on a specific form of gain—I like to use the word "betterment"—which is the gain arising from the decisions of the community, if I may use a word which is rather in vogue nowadays, with regard to permission to carry out development.<br><br>
It can be argued that the extraction of minerals or quarrying is not development in the way that people would normally understand that word. It is not development in the context of carrying out construction work on land which will result in buildings being located in areas and having a function which the local planning authority will wish to control and, because it has the right to control, will be able to determine what are known as windfall increments in value. It is a different form of operation that we are bringing into the net of development land tax under this clause.<br><br>
If one looks ahead to that unhappy and, I hope, avoidable time when the rate of tax creeps up to 80 per cent. on all gains over the exemption limits—and in due course, so we are told, to 100 per cent.—we shall be faced with a considerable deterrent to the selling of royalties or land with mineral rights. The fifty-fifty division will at that time result in a tax of 100 per cent. on one half and a capital gains tax—if we are talking about an individual, currently 30 per cent.—on the other half. My mathematics leads me to calculate that this would be an overall tax rate of 65 per cent.<br><br>
The Minister is required to believe, by reason of what he has already said in other clauses of the Bill, that a tax rate of 65 per cent. is not a deterrent to somebody to sell. That is an arguable contention. Bearing in mind the importance to this country of making the best use of our mineral resources—and, indeed,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1079">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 949</span>
of our farm resources—and the adverse effect on the balance of payments that increased imports of commodities can have, particularly at a time when sterling is weak and commodity prices may be against us and terms of trade are less favourable than we have been accustomed to, we should pause for a moment to consider whether, as one moves up the rate of tax, we shall not run into a considerable problem in the area of minerals and quarrying.<br><br>
Finally, I draw the Minister's attention to the problems that will arise on the part sale of a royalty. Is there anything here that would deter what I understand is quite a common practice of people selling part of the royalties in relation to the extraction of minerals or quarrying and retaining a rent interest in the other half. Will not that result in a rather complicated operation of tax? It seems to me that there would be difficulties in having a one-third of royalties, which one then divided into fifty-fifty with regard to the imposition of this tax, and a retained interest as well.<br><br>
It could be argued that the sold interest of 50 per cent., or less of the total interest, was the capital part of the total transaction and the retained interest was the income part. That would make the proposed method of treating the disclosure of proceeds for this tax somewhat anomalous, and I should be grateful if the Minister would consider that point as well.</span></p>
<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have a very important matter of principle in the difference between development of land in the sense that, I think it was Archimedes who said—"Give me a place to stand and I will move the Earth."<br><br>
Essentially, we are taxing the development of land because it is a place on which to put a house or an office. When we tax it for the winning of minerals, essentially it is not a location which increases in value, because one wants to place something there and it has to be put somewhere; it is actually a raw material. It is rather like saying that one would tax land upon which one grew wheat because the land is being used as a material in an industrial operation.<br><br>
In using the land for that purpose it is quite outwith the scope and intention of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 950</span>
a development tax which is intended to remove from the beneficiary the value of something which is put upon it because someone wishes to use part of the earth's surface to put something on it.<br><br>
It is important that the Government should understand that, in applying development tax to an industry in which the use of the land happens to be involved just as it is in Parliament, they are departing from the principle of the Act and engaging in a dangerous operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important and somewhat complicated clause, because mineral rights do not, like options in partnerships, fit easily into the scheme of things, as the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) mentioned. We are concerned with an asset which is neither clearly a capital asset nor clearly an income asset. It is somewhere in between, and this has always been, and will always be the difficulty due to the inherent nature of working minerals. We have attempted to recognise the special position of mineral rights in the legislation—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Attempted but failed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I think we have attempted to do so justly in recognising their special nature, because, as has been rightly pointed out, on a deemed disposal on a working and winning of mineral there will be no charge at all. In fact, the charge is a 50 per cent. charge on a sale or a lease as the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) mentioned. It is a charge on 50 per cent.<br><br>
That is reasonably fair. It shows how much importance we attach to the working and winning of minerals and, indeed, as time goes on, if it is seen that the legislation hampers this kind of development, I have no doubt at all that the matter will be kept under review and it will only make sense to do so. This has happened in the past: when it has been seen that previous legislation has hampered mineral development, Governments of both parties have been fairly rapid in changing the rules because of the importance to this country of mineral extraction.<br><br>
Although one cannot give assurances as to what happens in the future under other Governments or Ministers, I have no doubt that, because of the importance
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1080">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 951</span>
of minerals, the matter will be kept under review. But we think that at the moment we have arrived at a reasonable compromise.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hove asked about a part sale of royalties. He is right in that there will be a calculation of the granted and the retained interest, and I should not like to say that it will be a simple calculation. In practice, m some cases, it may be very complicated. But I will certainly look at the point the hon. Gentleman raised to see whether the complications that could arise might in any way inhibit this fairly common form of commercial exploitation of minerals. I cannot give an undertaking to change anything, but I will look at the point to see whether there is a problem here.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) asked me about subsection (5), which deals with leases. Perhaps I can make it clearer than do the Explanatory Notes. That subsection makes the necessary adaptations to the rule given in subsection (4) where the disposal is made in the form of a lease. Subsection (5) is concerned with a lease and not with the disposal of a freehold.<br><br>
In subsection (5), the non-mineral part of the consideration—which has to be found for the purposes of the clause—is found by reference to a notional lease which would not permit the land held under the lease to be used for winning or working minerals, but would permit its use for any other purpose which is either authorised by planning permission or for which planning permission might reasonably be expected to be obtained. The planning assumptions are necessary in order to provide a valuation basis for the notional lease.<br><br>
So we have a notional hypothetical lease, assuming that permission would not be given for winning and working minerals, which enables us to get the value of any other benefit in respect of planning permission, and which is not a benefit arising as the result of the winning or working of minerals. I hope that that explanation clarifies the matter for the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the lease to be actuarially valued as a capital sum, or is it to be treated on its annual let; because the lease may be a periodical one? Is it to be actuarially assessed as a total?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 952</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, it will be assessed actuarially as a total, taking into account the rent payable under the lease. It will not just be the rent; all the other factors will be taken into account and a capital sum arrived at as being the value of the lease, and actuarial factors will be taken into account.<br><br>
It will be revalued in the same way, of course, as leases are valued under other parts of this legislation. It is simply that we have a hypothetical lease in order to obtain the split between the mineral part and the non-mineral benefit that might possibly also accrue under any planning permission given for the land.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One has to add on subsection (6), where it is purely and simply a mineral lease, merely the grant of the right to work the minerals. There is then no question of the valuation. It is taken purely as a mineral licence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, subsection (6) is concerned only with mineral royalties, or royalties paid under licences.<br><br>
The point raised by the hon. Member for Hove with regard to variations—or was it valuations? I cannot remember which it was. The hon. Gentleman was raising a point on how appeals will be resolved. Perhaps I could check the <i>Hansard</i> report to see what he said about that and see whether I could write to him to clarify the position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I can solve that point, in that the Royal Institution at that time was referring to the White Paper, to the old draft Bill, and to the Clause 17 in that, which in fact relates to group companies in the White blue Paper.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, and not for the first time. I think that probably answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that we are all grateful to the Minister, particularly the industry which is well-represented in Wales, I believe, for his remark that if it appears at any time that the operation of this tax, particularly if we do get the higher rate, is hampering the winning and working of minerals, the matter can be kept under review. I think the Minister even used the words "speedily correct it". I am also grateful to him for agreeing to look at the complications
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1081">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 953</span>
that are likely to arise on royalties as well, to see whether there is anything that could be done to simplify this matter.</span></p>

EXEMPTION FOR PROJECTS BEGUN WITHIN TWO YEARS OF ACQUISITION OF LAND</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 197, in page 27, line 37, after 'reacquisition' insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'or within such longer period as appears to the Board or, on an appeal, to the Commissioners concerned to be just and reasonable'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we will take Amendment No. 352, in page 28, line 15, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'(4) Where an application under paragraph (<i>b</i>) of subsection (3) above is made not less than four months before the expiration of the period referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (2) above this section shall have effect as if the period mentioned in the said paragraph (<i>a</i>) were a reference to a period ending three months after the date on which the notification referred to in subsection (3) above is given to the owner if such a period would end later than that referred to in the said paragraph (<i>a</i>).'</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The ochre book notes to this clause are remarkably poor. There is a disparity between the length of the notes and the length of the clause. This slightly regrettable omission in the Explanatory Notes is why this clause is necessary.<br><br>
It is to be welcomed that there is to be a class of transactions which will not give rise to the need even to assess whether development land tax is payable. One assumes, without any direct guidance on this, that the two-year interval has been assumed to be a reasonable one not to run into the assessment of DLT on something which will turn out to be an inflationary gain. If the deemed disposal, or the start of a material development, had taken place immediately after the acquisition there would not have been any development value to be taxed. If a change in values has given rise to the appearance of a development value within two years, that should be ignored.<br><br>
If I am right in my assumption as to the reasonable purposes of the clause—they
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 954</span>
are ones which I welcome—it would seem that the inclusion of words such as appear in the amendment would be very fair. I have in mind particularly the not unfamiliar case where a developer may be ready, willing and able to start the development, whether residential or of any other type, and where for good reasons the planning authority may ask him to hold back until a later date because of an event, probably under its control, has occurred. That sort of situation is usually amicably resolved, if there is certainty about the dale when a start can be made.<br><br>
It would seem unreasonable if in those circumstances one were to run into the assessment for development land tax, whereas a start within a two-year period would not have given rise to such assessment.<br><br>
Equally, it is within our memory, even on as sunny and warm a spring day as this, that there are occasions when frost and snow abide for us for weeks at a time. I remember one major contractor with a name not unlike that of our Chairman being held up from a job in connection with a company with a name not unlike mine, for six whole weeks in the spring of 1962, when there was a very long continuous period of frost and snow. I can imagine some rather artificial events taking place if one had a material development due to start when one was edging towards the expiry of the two-year period and there was still about 3 ft. of snow on the ground. One would be hacking through the perma frost to ensure that the development took place within the two-year period.<br><br>
There is also the possibility that a local authority would behave fractionally unreasonably. It might be held to be a criticising local authority. It might occasionally happen that the administrative procedures had got into a bit of a tangle. There may even have been a local authority election, which would have caused some delay, because local authority committees do not tend to sit in that run-up period, as we are aware on this day.<br><br>
I suggest, therefore, that it is reasonable to have an escape clause which would allow this period to be extended for a reasonable period. I hope that this reasonable amendment will appeal to a reasonable Minister and find some acceptance.</span></p>

<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) said that he assumed that the two-year period was chosen as a reasonable one. The two-year period we are talking about is the period that is allowed to the developer; if he acts within that period, he will be free from payment of development land tax.<br><br>
Amendment No. 197 seeks to provide for a period longer than two years at the discretion of the Board. Granting the Board such discretionary powers would cause great difficulty in defining the circumstances in which such discretion could be held to be justified, and there would be the further administrative complications of having to examine deemed disposals in this way.<br><br>
A statutory rule is better not only for the operation of the tax, but also for the developer himself. What the developer wants is some degree of certainty. Provided that the purchaser paid the full market value for the land, the legislation gives him the certainty that, provided that he acts within the two-year period, he is exempt from the tax. This is of considerable importance to him.<br><br>
It is also of value to the developer as well as the Inland Revenue—I grant our interest here as well—that the administrative and valuation work which can be very considerable, is removed in respect of these relatively small amounts of development land tax which might be chargeable on the increase in the valuation over those two years. The line has to be drawn somewhere and one can always criticise where it is drawn. It is a compromise between savings in administrative work, on the one hand, and the loss of DLT revenue, on the other. I think two years is a not unreasonable compromise.<br><br>
The problem about Amendment No. 197 is that it would provide uncertainty for the developer. He will not know, as he will following the introduction of the legislation, where he stands.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can see the line of argument that the Minister is following. He says that the developer will not know. Surely the developer would be in no less certainty with regard to the two years if the amendment were accepted. That is not changed. What would change would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 956</span>
be the possibility of an extension of the period if that seemed reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the way that the legislation is framed the developer can tell with pretty great certainty that, if he has paid the full market value, there will be no development land tax payable by him. That is a very high level of certainty. It is only where there might be doubt as to whether it is an arm's length transaction, or something like that, that there may be some doubt whether the tax is payable. Once discretion is given to the Board, that level of certainty no longer applies. There are avoidance problems here of a kind I shall be happy to go into if required. Not only is the matter important on its own, but it interacts with the problem I have mentioned and makes it even more complicated to deal with by requiring further measures to allow for the problems of avoidance.<br><br>
Amendment No. 352 allows for an application to the Board, under the procedure, four months before the end of the two-year period and says that, as long as the project starts within three months after the Board's notification, it will also be exempt from development land tax. Clearly, this will produce a Premium on delay. We shall come to amendments dealing with this matter later but, in certain cases, it could be to the advantage of the developer when he is asked a number of questions requiring a follow-up not to expedite the provision of information that he would be required to produce in order to substantiate his claim. A delay that was to the advantage of the individual, which he could influence himself, would provide further problems in the administration of the tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am a little puzzled as to why the hon. Gentleman should think that the delay would be an advantage to the developer. If a developer is able to proceed, and if he is not held up by extraneous events or his own lack of preparedness in times like these, when building costs regularly seem to go up sharply and interest rates on capital already committed are high, most developers want to get on with the job. They do not want to delay for their own purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are many cases, as the hon. Gentleman knows, where
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1083">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 957</span>
delay is natural in itself. But we are here talking about a delay of three months after notification by the Board before development land tax becomes payable. Clearly, the combination of these two factors could be very strong indeed—such factors which the developer himself could influence by means open to him. I see the problems the hon. Gentleman correctly understands, but, for those reasons, I do not think that I can recommend the Committee to accept either of these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course, one appreciates that whenever the Commissioners or the Board are given a discretion there is difficulty in showing when that discretion should be used. But here we are dealing with a case of the development not giving rise to any significant amount of realised development value. That is the first condition, as it were, of the relief which can be claimed within the two years.<br><br>
The other point about it is that Amendment No. 197, which we have proposed, uses the words:
<br><blockquote><p>"or within such longer period as appears to the Board…"</p></blockquote>
It necessarily follows from that, and, if it is thought necessary to put it in I am sure my hon. Friend would agree that it should be based on a hardship claim by the developer.<br><br>
Elsewhere in the Bill there are cases in which there would be relief if hardship were shown; it is the whole basis of payments by instalments later in the Bill. In many tax provisions relief is given at the discretion of the Board or the Commissioners where hardship is shown.<br><br>
One does not need to lay down elaborate rules for the exercise of the discretion. The Financial Secretary used the argument that, if we give a discretion to the Board, we must lay down rules concerning that discretion. Surely that is just what one does not do in giving a discretion. It is a discretion in the Board's opinion; hardship is proved and relief should be given.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary made heavy weather of this matter. It is not as if there are no other provisions in which the Board is given discretion to give relief in the case of hardship. I may, perhaps, be arguing on the basis of hardship when that is not in the amendment, but clearly the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 958</span>
amendment is aimed at cases where, because it is outside the control of the developer, hardship falls on him through his not being able to start his project within the two years. I have always felt, wherever one puts a period of this sort in legislation, that there should be an escape clause so that the axe does not fall at midnight of the particular day that one puts in the legislation. There should be a discretion here when through certain causes, and in frequent cases acts of God, it is impossible to start a project. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) said, the weather could be impossible for the start of a project and it should be possible for the Board to exercise its discretion in favour of the person chargeable.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my right hon. Friend. Indeed I feel that his remarks about the need for discretion can be verified by consideration of the manner in which the Inland Revenue actually operates. I feel that there would be unparalleled difficulties if no discretion were to be given on any issue to any officers or tax inspectors in the operation of any of the aspects of taxation. It is well known that a great deal of discretion and wisdom has to be used to make any system of taxation workable at all.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend says, there are always disadvantages when one has hard lines drawn and no let-out clause, whether it be acts of God or not. God always gets blamed for the weather when it is bad. He can perhaps take some credit when it is good. Other things, too, are definitely beyond control.<br><br>
As an example of the point I made earlier, I recall not so long ago that Sainsbury's were to develop a supermarket in conjunction with a local authority in an expanding town, and we put it to the authority that its servicing arrangements for the shopping in the immediate vicinity were wrong because it required service vehicles to cross pedestrian routes unnecessarily. The authority did not agree, so we proceeded with the acquisition and planning; and then we had local government reorganisation. Let us leave aside the merits or demerits of local government reorganisation. The end result was that in its infinite wisdom the new local authority looked at the plans and decided that they were all wrong. It took the point that we had already made and asked us
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1084">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 959</span>
not to start because it wanted to have another look at the servicing arrangements because they required vehicles to cross pedestrian routes.<br><br>
Naturally, we stopped and waited while the local authority decided in fact that we could get into the area behind the high street area where the expanded shop was coming by knocking down a very small amount of property which was of no great significance and creating much better servicing arrangements. In fact, it made quite a considerable difference to the layout of the store and to the servicing of the store, and a long delay resulted.<br><br>
If there were no let-out clause, there would be all sorts of difficulties. Local authorities would have to revoke planning permissions and I can see that ill-will would creep in. A great deal can be said for a discretionary provision which, as my right hon. Friend says would be just and reasonable.<br><br>
I can see that there would be circumstances when perhaps the local authority and development together would say that it wanted to think again about something, and could the Board allow another six months for it to be looked at under Clause 18 without throwing the whole thing back into a DLT calculation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am asked to apply discretion to the collection of taxes. This is extremely dangerous ground indeed. The history of discretion is that it is operated in certain areas, particularly in collection, matters of distraint, and so on, where established rules have been laid down and over the years precedents have built up. What we have done here by legislation is to provide an advantage to those who within two years of a purchase commenced a project of development. The two years is an exemption allowed to meet the particular problem to which the hon. Gentleman referred. Instead of giving a two-year exemption, one could have given the Board the power to release the developers from the obligation to pay development land tax. Instead of saying that this should be a two-year period, one could say "Where you have a good case, or where there are great problems, instead of giving you a two-year period we have discretion to give you this particular relief". Civil servants have considerable amounts of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 960</span>
discretion, but one can find ways of avoiding its necessity by means of rules that are clear and fair. I believe that this is a better way to proceed. The two-year period is intended to deal with precisely the particular problems to which the hon. Gentleman referred.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
I suppose that, for clarity, the amount of discretion, which it would be dangerous to continue to increase without limiting our tax system, is one point that we have to bear in mind, but I find myself reluctantly unconvinced by the argument which has so far been put forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sydney Irving</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that there are arguments on both sides. I can see the validity of the point made by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), but I hope that he was not referring to the authority to which I belong in his reference to difficulties about getting the legs crossed over traffic circulation.<br><br>
As one who has been involved during the past year or two in endeavouring to speed up local authority processes and to get planning consents concluded as quickly as possible, I believe that there is also an argument for saying that if there is a two-year period it will assist those lethargic authorities to get on with the work of determining the applications more quickly than perhaps some of them have done in the past.<br><br>
There is a tendency for applications to get into the pipeline and not to emerge as quickly as they could if the authority were really determined to go as fast as it could. Therefore, while there are arguments on both sides, this will act as a stimulus and be beneficial to developers such as the hon. Member for Hove in getting the kind of consents which they want and in ensuring that local authorities do not waste any time in the process of determining applications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Dartford (Mr. Irving) for his assistance on this amendment. However, I think that it perhaps does not apply. What we are dealing with here is a development within a two-year period, and we are trying to extend that two-year period at the discretion of the Board when there has been no significant amount of development. If the developer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1085">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 961</span>
within that two-year period applies for planning permission on property which had not had planning permission at the beginning of the two years, he would be substantially increasing the value of the property. Therefore, I do not think he could claim relief under Clause 18 on the grounds that the amount of increase was insignificant.<br><br>
This supports even further the argument that we have been putting forward in favour of this clause. It is a very narrow position. The developer would have to show that although it applies to property which he acquired at any time it had not increased in value to any significant extent. At the beginning of the two years he would apply for clearance under subsection (3), so the Board would know all about it. It is not a question of springing it on the Board at the end of the two-year period and saying "I cannot start a project because, for some reason, something has cropped up which makes it impossible".<br><br>
Previously I used the word "hardship" all through my argument. I think hardship follows from the words "just and reasonable" which are in the amendment. To say that it is not possible for the Board to decide what is just and reasonable shoots a hole in the Bill as drafted, because those same words are used in Clause 4(5), not by means of an amendment which the Opposition introduced into the Bill, but in the Bill as drafted. We have therefore chosen the accepted words "just and reasonable". We have chosen a process of discretion which is given to the Board in many tax cases.<br><br>
We have chosen a narrow case where the chargeable person seeking relief will have to bring himself within other rules in the subsection, such as there not being a significant amount of increase. I therefore press the Financial Secretary to think yet again about this. He said that he was not convinced. I am not sure that my rambling words will succeed in convincing him, but if they put any doubt into his mind as to whether he is right, perhaps he could hold out some hope to us that this will be considered again.<br><br>
It is a point which has been put to us with some strength. The Federation of British Industry, The Law Society and the accountants' bodies are all keen that there should be this discretion. The argument is that the chargeable person wants certainty. If he is to be relieved of the certainty of paying the tax at a certain
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 962</span>
time, I do not think he will complain about the flexibility in the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's approach to these arguments.<br><br>
May I refer to the matter raised by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) when he was discussing what was just and reasonable? He pointed out the problems that could make for a lengthier period of decision-making in this matter than might otherwise have been generally accepted. I understand that there may be problems—weather conditions, financial difficulties, and so on.<br><br>
I find it difficult to understand how one could define "just and reasonable" in those terms. Would it have been just and reasonable if the developer had certain financial problems? Would it be just and reasonable if there were conditions about which there was a great deal of subjectivity? These are problems that I foresee.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman rightly pointed to the fact that we use the words "just and reasonable" in Clause 4. There we are considering questions of apportionment which require rather less precision because there are other intangible factors involved. We selected the period of two years to take into account precisely the problems that were mentioned by the hon. Member for Hove, and the right hon. Member for Crosby. (Mr. Page).<br><br>
The period of two years is a much easier way of meeting those problems. Right at the outset, in moving this amendment, the hon. Member for Hove understood that and pointed out that it was an arbitrary figure. He was right about that. If it is a question of looking at the matter in the light of what has so far been said and to reconsider whether two years might meet all the cases, I have no fixed view on many of these aspects which concern the actual detailed operation of the legislation. I would certainly be prepared to see whether the arbitrary figure of two years is the right one, and that I will willingly do. But I should have thought that this was the best way to proceed, both for the reasons I have given and because it gives us an opportunity to take into account certain other comments and representations that might yet be made.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 963</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has opened up a little crack of encouragement that he is at least sympathetic to the point and has raised the problem of how to define "just and reasonable". As my right hon. Friend pointed out, the words were taken from the Bill anyway, so we will always have problems of defining what is just and reasonable. But, in the light of what the Financial Secretary said, it would be appropriate to take away the amendment and consider whether we can devise a formula that would perhaps restrict the right to apply for an extension to circumstances such as, for example, where there is a joint application by the planning authority and the developer, and see whether we can come back at a later stage with an amendment somewhat more restricted that would find favour with the Financial Secretary. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 198, in page 27, line 45, after 'above', insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'an amount shall be significant if it is more than 10 per cent. of the owner's cost of acquisition or such larger amount as appears to the Board or, on an appeal, to the Commissioners concerned to be just and reasonable, and'.</p></blockquote>
This is the moment when one wishes for what I call "instant <i>Hansard</i>". I am sure that it will not be too long before the wonders of technology will enable us to be passed as we come to the next amendment the full text of the debate on the previous one. I should like to use the words of the departing Financial Secretary, because here we are going completely the other way in trying to give some certainty as to whether the Board has the relevant discretion. Clause 18 gives the Board the power to decide how much development value is significant before it allows an exemption under the terms of the clause.<br><br>
The amendment introduces the minimum development value below which the Board could not hold that development had taken place unless an increase value was "significant", and removes some of the uncertainty.<br><br>
I took a few jottings of what the Financial Secretary said and it looks as though the Minister has taken some, too. Once discretions are given to the Board, he said—and for clarity it was better to have a certain period—it was dangerous to continue to increase the amount of discretion in our tax system.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 964</span>
With the subtlety and skill which the Government Front Bench are using in bludgeoning through this grasping legislation, they have switched from one wing to the other so that the Financial Secretary will not only not answer the amendment, but has actually left the Committee Room, to avoid any embarrassment. I am sure that had the Minister of State been that much more alert he would have remained out of the room until the amendment which sought to provide flexibility had been completed so that he could come in and argue the other way round on the amendment which tries to improve certainty. But I look forward with interest to his reaction to the amendment.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, this is a different amendment from the previous one but, as always, I hope that we shall show him that Treasury Ministers are entirely consistent in what they say and that there is little discrepancy between the way in which they deal with one amendment and another.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary said, there is considerable danger involved in giving too much discretion to any Government Department in relation to the administration of the law, whether taxation laws or any other laws. Where possible, legislation should try to reduce the discretion to a reasonable balance.<br><br>
Lawyers get very excited about such matters and, thinking as lawyers, want to give no discretion at all. They want everything clearly set down in statute, but in practice it is just not possible to operate in that way.<br><br>
Sometimes it is fairer to the taxpayer that there should be a discretion rather than a hard-and-fast rule. It happens in fixing dates, for instance. When dates are fixed in legislation, there is always the hard case. It is sometimes better for everybody concerned that there should be a discretion, and I do not think anyone would accuse the Board of Inland Revenue of having abused any discretion it has been given. Accountants and people who deal with the Inland Revenue I think generally agree that when the Board has a discretion it is exercised fairly. I accept entirely that it is not always clear why certain decisions have been taken or
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1087">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 965</span>
the reasons for doing so, and in a perfect world it would be better not done in this way.<br><br>
I confess that I have considerable sympathy with the points behind Amendment No. 198, though not necessarily with the figuring or the second part of the amendment which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"such larger amount as appears to the Board or, on an appeal, to the Commissioners concerned to be just and reasonable."</p></blockquote>
The person who drafted the amendment is creating the same kind of difficulty as we are creating, if there is difficulty, in the legislation.<br><br>
I take the point that we have here a situation where the Board decides what is significant and what is not significant in a situation where its decision is crucial and important. If the Board decides that the development value is not significant, no tax is paid. If it decides that it is significant, tax will be paid. The object of the clause is to exclude tax where the development takes place within two years and where, if the development took place immediately the property was bought, there would be no development value.<br><br>
Most situations will be dealt with quite simply and there will be no tax to be paid, because in cases where the full price, or a price close to the full price, has been paid for the land if development were carried out immediately afterwards there would be no development land tax to be paid as the betterment element would have been included in the cost of acquisition, bearing in mind the extra 10 per cent. There might be cases where some tax would be paid and the object of the legislation is to try to exclude the less significant cases.<br><br>
I am in some difficulty, because I can see the force of the argument, but I should have thought that a figure of 10 per cent., even if one were to concede that it is better to have a figure, would be too high. We are adding 10 per cent. to the cost of acquisition, anyway, and the cases we are concerned with here would be cases where the base value was computed on the basis of the cost of acquisition. I should have thought that most cases would involve a builder buying land—a green field site possibly. If he developed the land immediately, he would pay no tax. We are adding 10 per cent. to the cost of acquisition, which is a fairly large uplift. Here we could be adding another 10 per cent. We could be adding
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 966</span>
20 per cent. to the cost of acquisition if the amendment were accepted.<br><br>
Although I recognise the difficulty and am prepared to look at it again to see whether we can put in a percentage instead of the word "significant", I would not be prepared to accept a percentage as high as 10 per cent., because I think it is too high. I take the point about the word "significant" and that perhaps it would be better to deal with the matter on the basis of some percentage—</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I was saying, I recognise that it is not entirely satisfactory that the Board, albeit that it would be very fair, can decide whether an amount is significant and I am prepared to look at the matter again to see if we could have a percentage figure so that everybody knows exactly where they stand.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are grateful to the Minister for recognising that he was on the horns of a dilemma and in danger of blowing hot and cold over these two amendments. We were absolutely consistent in the last amendment as compared with this one. We want a basic figure, in the last amendment two years and in this case 10 per cent., with a discretion added to relieve those cases where it would be unjust and unreasonable to apply a fixed figure. I do not know whether Mr. Potash or Mr. Perlmutter will explain to me whether there was any precedent for the words "significant amount".</span></p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S <i>attention having been called to the fact that seven Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seven Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was about to use some classical allusions, but perhaps it is better if I do not. I was going on to discuss Cox and Box, Jekyll and Hyde, Scylla and Charybdis and all the other pairs I could think of, to show that the Government really were blowing hot and cold on these two amendments.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1088">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 967</span>
I asked what was the precedent for the use of the word "significant". Significant as compared with what? Significant in percentage? It said a "significant amount" in the Bill as drafted, but it must be relative to something. One halfpenny is a significant amount, but I imagine that would not be the case when one comes to interpret this clause.<br><br>
We thought that a percentage figure was at least of some value as a basic figure instead of using a particular amount. I suppose one could say "A tax liability of £1,000, or such larger amount as the Board may consider just and reasonable." But the "significant" must be relative to the transaction and, therefore, a percentage seems to be the right way to judge it.<br><br>
We are grateful to the Minister for saying that he will look at this matter again. I am sure that my hon. Friend is not wedded to the figure of 10 per cent., but it seems a reasonable amount. I hope that, if the Minister looks favourably on the principle of this amendment, he will not reduce it to too low an amount so that we have to argue it all over again.<br><br>
There is value in the principle of having a basic figure in the form of a percentage and then giving a discretion to the Board. We are completely consistent in our arguments, and I look forward to seeing at a later stage what the Minister proposes in this respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am doubly grateful to the Minister for providing me with some appropriate quotations for the occasion when we return to various provisions. I think he said it was sometimes fairer to have discretion, and he reminded us that the Inland Revenue never abuses the discretion which it is given. Next time we argue the point, I shall ask to have him on my side because he puts those points so eloquently.<br><br>
On the more substantial issue we are, grateful that the Minister is prepared to look at the matter again.<br><br>
I should like to remind the Minister that valuation is perhaps an art as much as a science, and that the best valuers seldom agree on the value of property. There is an element of art and a considerable element of judgment involved. The Minister referred to the full price having been paid. In normal circumstances the price paid is taken to be the amount of value. Unless special circumstance apply,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 968</span>
that is the best evidence of value that one can have. Therefore, normally one would assume that the price paid by the developer was the full price at the time. Clearly, the Minister may have in mind the possibility of certain subterfuges for avoidance purposes, but normally the price paid is the best evidence of value. There is a strong case for avoiding giving valuers too much work.<br><br>
Members of the Select Committee on Wealth Tax were very much reminded of the problems that face skilled valuers following the extra work thrown upon them by recent legislation. We want to avoid referring to two sets of valuers. There are probably cases where there is little doubt about the validity of the price paid. Therefore, I very much support my right hon. Friend when he said the percentage was the right approach. I hope that when he looks at this measure again, if considering an alternative figure, he will keep it as a percentage. Even if large sums of money are involved, a calculation of 2 or 3 per cent. could involve a figure of £20,000 or £30,000. The valuation is only within a percentage limit. The developer will have committed very large sums of money and large amounts of interest will have built up. The other point that must be borne in mind is the fact that interest rates are not likely to get down to the Dalton 2½ per cent. for some while and therefore there is considerable expense in holding land for development.<br><br>
We are grateful to the Minister for being prepared to look at this matter again, and I hope that he will bear in mind the percentage figure. In view of what he has said, I beg leave to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 196, in page 28, line 12, after 'shall', insert 'within thirty days thereafter'.<br><br>
We are continuing on this amendment to deal with the question of certainty of discretion. In this particular instance the clause says:
<br><blockquote><p>"the Board shall notify the owner whether, if the project were to be begun forthwith, they would or would not be satisfied that the conditions in subsection (2) above would be fulfilled…"</p></blockquote>

I am not suggesting that the Board would unnecessarily delay a matter, but the time factor is critical. Therefore, it is reasonable that the Board should be required to behave in a manner which recognises the critical timing of the situation.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Dartford (Mr. Irving), apropos an earlier amendment, said that he felt that there was something to be said for including a time element because it provided a stimulus for those local authorities, which were a little slower in the conduct of their affairs, to get on with the matter. I suggest to the Government that the inclusion of the words suggested in this amendment would provide a stimulus to the Board to get on with the matter. It should not be difficult to determine and, bearing in mind that the developer may be in a total state of suspended animation while he is waiting for a clearance from the Board, few developments can bear extra costs. Therefore, I anticipate that it will be very necessary in many cases for the developer to know that he has a clearance under this provision before he can put in train the sequence of events which are necessary for the development action to be carried out.<br><br>
The developer will be reluctant to commit himself to increased professional fees by the development of a detailed design or by asking the quantity surveyor to prepare a bill of quantities which in itself involves a fee in excess of 1 per cent. That may not seem a great deal of money, but if one is paying 2 per cent. to a quantity surveyor on a £2 million contract it involves a good deal of money. The developer does not want to involve himself in that sort of expenditure without a clearance. Therefore, it is reasonable that we ask the Board to carry out its functions with reasonable speed.<br><br>
Therefore, I take it that this amendment will be acceptable—or perhaps the Minister will say that the period should be 35 or 40 days. I am not laying down any special number of days, but I do feel that there should be a reasonable time limit on the Board and that the matter should not be left in a state of uncertainty for a developer when he may or may not obtain the clearance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would require the Board to give notification under subsection (3) within 30 days. We are here dealing with the owner of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 970</span>
interest and his application for a clearance for exemption from paying development land tax within the two-year period.<br><br>
The difficulty in furnishing the certainty which the hon. Gentleman requests—and accept that we are continuing the same debate in part that a reply will be given within 30 days or any other period—relates to the problem of achieving a degree of consistency in the time required to deal with these applications.<br><br>
There is a wide range of types of application. Some can be dealt with by return of post but others involve very much more complicated matters. There are those of a very large size indeed where, in view of the nature of the project it is obviously unreasonable to put in an application 30 days before the end of the two-year period. The vast majority of cases would be dealt with expeditiously.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman referred to various problems that might arise. There are the problems of valuation which may be required in certain cases, and problems where additional information—even background information—may be required. It is very hard to lay down a time limit in this way. I went into this matter myself because I accept that it is an important point and agree that some projects could be harmed if there were to be any delay in the general administration of the scheme.<br><br>
Applications made within the two year period will be afforded a high degree of priority, and some of them will take only a few days to process. I am aware that this matter is being taken very seriously because of the points made by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury). I do not think that we can go in such a direction, but certainly future Ministers, and the Inland Revenue, will continue to stand by what they have admitted is the high degree of priority to be given to applications of this kind. What we say here must help to reinforce that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is satisfactory to hear the Financial Secretary say that the Board will treat these cases with high priority. Indeed, if a matter reaches the top officials this will undoubtedly be so. But sometimes the process gets baulked at the lower echelons of official. I should like to see some direction in the Bill to the Board to deal with them in this form.<br><br>
If there is delay, the developer will in some cases be in difficulty. He must judge
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1090">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 971</span>
whether he should go ahead with the development within two years and whether he should seek the relief afforded by those two years—or if he thinks he will not be given that relief, if the Board thinks that the amount will be more than an insignificant amount and refuses him relief, he might not embark on the project at that stage. If there is no point in his doing so, he can sit back and wait for a little longer, but he will be almost entirely dependent on the time that the Board takes to answer his request for a clearance.<br><br>
The difficulty in dealing with this amendment is that there is no sanction. What happens if the Board does not reply within the period of time stated in the amendment? Are we to say that the developer will get the relief simply because the Board has not replied to a clearance? It would be very difficult to say that. Therefore, it is to some extent purposeless to put in a time. But I do not believe that it is purposeless when some direction is given to the Board in a statute to deal with a matter in an expeditious way.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) said that he did not abide by a suggestion of a period of 30 days. If some direction were given in the statute obliging the Board to give its answer with expedition, it would be much fairer—to use the phrase used previously, more "just and reasonable"—to the chargeable person if that were put into the statute.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me take up what my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said. If a period of 30 days is too difficult because of the reasons given by the Financial Secretary about the varying nature of the applications that will come forward, perhaps one could consider the inclusion of some words, which will be enshrined in the statute somewhere, such as "as soon as is reasonably practicable" or the word "possible". As the provision stands, there is no pressure on the Board at all to notify the owner within a specific time period.<br><br>
I think I am right in saying that the Board in exercising its functions under this legislation would be subject to scrutiny by the Parliamentary Commissioner. It seems to me that if we were to include some appropriate phrase the Parliamentary Commissioner would have something to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 972</span>
get his teeth into if the Board were to drag its feet unreasonably in exercising its responsibilities. I cannot see, as the clause is worded, that anybody could hold that there were maladministration if the Board took a very long time and said "We are sorry but we have not been able to get any more staff, it is a holiday period, the matter is complicated and the valuer concerned has just had 'flu". All sorts of excuses could be advanced which could be allowed to delay matters, unless somebody got some effort going to produce an answer as fast as reasonably practicable.<br><br>
Therefore, I hope that the Financial Secretary might be able to consider, even if the amendment as worded is not acceptable to him, whether there would not be some formula, however mild and modest, which would give an aggrieved developer something to which to attach his argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The difficulty here—and I think both the hon. Gentleman and his right hon. Friend have seen it—is that there could be the wholly exceptional case of a kind that we cannot foresee, but with which the legislation has to deal. In such a case a time limit is incredibly difficult to accept. In so far as one can lay an obligation on the Inland Revenue to proceed as expeditiously as possible, or as soon as is reasonably practicable, my understanding is that those directives are already binding on the Inland Revenue in its general work.<br><br>
I should have thought the best way to reinforce this matter would be to have a declaration by me in this Committee, which might add something to what was already there. Under the ordinary statutes, the Board of Inland Revenue has traditions enjoining it to perform its statutory function expeditiously. However, I am always pleased to try, wherever possible, to speed up matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary referred to the Board being under a general statutory obligation to carry out its responsibility expeditiously. If this is so—and I am sure he is right because I am a veritable amateur in the complex field of taxation—it may answer the point. It seems to me that this is a case where, if there were unnecessary delay, an aggrieved developer might well feel that it is a matter which should go before the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1091">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 973</span>
Parliamentary Commissioner and a matter in which he should consider whether it constituted anything which could be held to be maladministration. If a general direction to the Board existed and could be used at this point, it might meet the requirement.<br><br>
However, if after considering the matter, one considers that it is not sufficiently clear and that it would be right to bring in to the clause at this point some appropriate form of wording, perhaps we could come back on that at a later stage. In view of what the Financial Secretary has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>12 noon</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 353, in page 28, line 15, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'(4) If the information supplied to the Board at the time of the application under subsection (3) above is insufficient to enable the Board to state whether or not they would be satisfied in accordance with that subsection they shall ask the owner of the interest for such further information as they may require in accordance with subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of the said subsection (3) and the furnishing of such additional information shall be treated as having been made under the said subsection (3).'</p></blockquote>
The purpose of this amendment is related to the previous amendment. We are again concerned that the developer should get his answer from the Board as expeditiously as possible. This is a probing amendment to make sure that if the Board on receiving an application from the developer for clearance under this section feels that it lacks sufficient information to make a judgment as to whether the proposed development would qualify for exemption under the provisions of the section, it can say to the applicant, "Could we please have further information on points A, B and C?", or whatever they are, and will not just refuse application on the grounds that it has not enough information to give an affirmative reply.<br><br>
I am advised that when Section 488 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 was introduced, most people assumed that if clearance were sought under that section and the Inland Revenue needed more information in order to reach a decision, the Revenue would be able to ask for it in the same way as under the clearance procedure in Section 464.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 974</span>
I understand that the Revenue takes a contrary view—namely, that if the taxpayer is not sufficiently prescient to guess what information is needed and cannot provide it when he applies for clearance, the Revenue cannot ask for more information but is bound to refuse clearance.<br><br>
We wish to establish in this amendment that if there is a lack of information at any point, the Revenue would go back and ask for additional information and would not just refuse the application. When the developer then asked the reason for refusal, he would be told that he had not provided all the information necessary for clearance. He would then provide additional information to press the application.<br><br>
That would be thoroughly unsatisfactory and burdensome on the administration. Perhaps I should make it clear that, in a sense, this is a probing amendment. I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to assure the Committee that the Board will ask for more information and will not merely refuse the application.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes his position clear. This concerns the developer who wants to carry out the development within the two-year period, and the information he is required to provide in the application he puts before the Inland Revenue.<br><br>
If the information is inadequate, he is concerned—and I can understand his concern—that the application should not be rejected out of hand, but that the Inland Revenue should ask the person concerned for the further information which has been omitted.<br><br>
I accept the purpose of the amendment. I could go much further and say that it is the intention of the Board to proceed in just this way, and that if further information is required it will be considered as part of the original application when it is received.<br><br>
It is better to put the matter in this way, rather than trying to put it in exact terms in the legislation. I think this meets precisely the point concerned. Many of these procedures start on the basis of the original practice which is confirmed through usage. That is probably the best way to proceed, and I think is in line with other provisions of a similar kind.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1092">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 975</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If every member of the Board of Inland Revenue and all its underlings were perfect, ideal and gods almighty, instead of their being human beings, we should be satisfied with what the Financial Secretary said. But there are cases where, through human perversity, error, obstinacy, determination, or whatever it may be, some official will chuck out a first claim for clearance, saying that as he has not the necessary information.<br><br>
I should like to see this matter set out in the Bill as the amendment provides, putting an obligation on the Board to see that, if full information is not provided, there is a request for the further information.<br><br>
After all, we are starting on something new here—namely, a provision which may be of great benefit to developers but which will be used frequently for those who are developing within this period of two years. Indeed, there is no doubt that a practice will build up in due course. One will know what the Board requires, but there may be confusion in the first period of time when the practice has not developed. Hardship will result if any member of the Inland Revenue throws out one of these applications simply because it has not sufficient information.<br><br>
There is no reason why we should not put these four or five lines in the Bill as it will not increase its size. For a Bill of this type it is not very large. I would rather have another 30 pages in the Bill if it would make matters more clear.<br><br>
I am eager that the person who is a developer—the person whom we want to encourage to continue with developing—to take the relief which will be given if he is entitled to it. It would be unfair to put him into difficulties because someone in the Inland Revenue is obstinate and will not tell him what is wanted.<br><br>
Perhaps I ought not to give the Financial Secretary an escape from this, having put so forcefully that I want this matter set out in the Bill. I hesitate to say this in the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), but if the Financial Secretary were to give an undertaking that he will issue, immediately the Bill receives Royal Assent, a statement of practice on extra statutory directions, my hon. Friend might be satisfied. But if this provision is not to go into the Bill, we must have an assurance that there will be a statement of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 976</span>
practice right away, rather than to wait for it to be developed.<br><br>
We cannot let subsection (6) operate so that at some later date a generous member of the Inland Revenue will say "I have not got the information I want, but I will let the application through". What happens when later it is said that insufficient information was given at the time of the application?<br><br>
In order to meet the position of an obstinate member or of a generous member of the Inland Revenue, we want this type of amendment to be incorporated in the clause. I hope that the Financial Secretary will give the Committee some further assurances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The existence of subsection (6) is rather important in this context. If something were let through and a clearance were invalidated because of lack of information, the implications for the developer could be very serious.<br><br>
We were all reassured to hear the Financial Secretary say clearly that it was the intention that the Board should act in this way and ask for more information. I rarely disagree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, but I was horrified at the thought of another 30 pages tacked on to the 165 pages which we are already required to have in this Bill in what we thought was a relatively simple matter of taxing betterment gain. Perhaps he requires a 15 per cent. discretion.<br><br>
Luckily, we are not concerned with 30 pages, not even 39. But we are concerned with—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The 39 articles?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must avoid being lured down that path.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It would be out of order.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment tries to make clear that it is in the statute that the Board shall behave in the way that the Financial Secretary suggested it should. Some of us have reservations about extra-statutory directions.<br><br>
However, we are here concerned with a new tax which will be largely administered by staff deployed there for this purpose. Would there be some advantage in including this sort of provision to make it clear that in this particular matter from this particular office, matters would be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1093">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 977</span>
dealt with in this way, and that it would be a requirement that the Board should go back for information whenever such is required in order for them to give a clearance.<br><br>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will consider the case we have advanced, and particularly what my right hon. Friend said on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is right for the hon. Member for Hove and the Committee to probe the intentions of the legislation.<br><br>
I am not sure that every aspect of the provision ought to find its way into the Act. If it did, I think we should find very much more than the additional 30 pages referred to. There is all the practice that is built up by the Inland Revenue, and the mass of documentation that goes to the various offices where the application of the tax is carried out. If this were all to find its way into legislation it would be very much more indigestible than it is now.<br><br>
I might set at rest the worries that have been expressed by the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen). We are not here talking about an extra-statutory concession. We are discussing what the actual practice of the Inland Revenue will be. There are many aspects of practice—the kinds of form the Inland Revenue produces, the questions that that Department will ask, and things of that kind, which could form parts of monster Bills. Any aspect of that practice is the legitimate subject for a probing investigation by any member of this Committee.<br><br>
That is one aspect of practice. I can give an assurance that the practice will be as I have described. I will go further and give an assurance that clear instructions will be sent out to the staff of the DLT office on this point. If we were to try to spell out every single transaction which our officers carry out with the public, we would find the legislation growing to an indefinite extent in a way that we would not find convenient.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman made his point very well. I can say that it is fully accepted that further instructions should go out stating the manner in which this matter should be dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's assurance, which he gave so clearly, and for which we are grateful, that instructions
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 978</span>
will be sent out on this point, although I would have marginally preferred that it should have been within the statute, and as I appreciate what he said about the legislation becoming too unwieldy if we try to cover every point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 354, in page 29, line 2, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(7) For the purpose of subsection (3) above a person who has entered into a contract, whether conditional or unconditional, to acquire an interest in land shall be treated as being an owner of that interest.'</p></blockquote>
This is the last amendment on this clause and appropriately it seeks to add something to the end of it.<br><br>
The purpose of the amendment is self-explanatory. It is to some extent a probing amendment, because I am not absolutely clear whether the clause as drafted covers the provisions of the amendment. What we are trying to establish is that somebody who has entered into a conditional contract, as well as someone who has entered into an unconditional contract, is in a position to apply to the board for clearance under the terms of this section.<br><br>
When there is a development land tax on the Statute Book, it is probable that a large proportion of developments will proceed only after clearance has been obtained under this clause. I expect that it will become almost normal practice for developers to obtain clearance under these provisions and to commence their work within two years. The critical nature of that two-year period is something to which we might return on "clause stand part."<br><br>
Clearly, it would be helpful, particularly when one bears in mind the length of time it takes for the sequence of activities to get a material development started, for a potential developer to be able to apply to the Board for clearance as soon as possible. The tax position under this legislation will certainly be one of the critical factors in determining whether a development will take place. It would seem sensible that it should be possible to avoid the completion of a contract if it appears that the proposed development would not obtain clearance under these provisions.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1094">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 979</span>
Therefore, the amendment is intended to ensure that a developer could enter into a contract with a vendor that would be completed upon clearance being granted by the Board under the terms of the Bill, so that when he completes the contract he will be in a position to know that, if he can start the development within the two years, he will have no liability for development land tax, given that the development proposed still conforms with the conditions of the clause and the development is under way within two years.<br><br>
In view of what has been said about allowing earlier applications, and particularly in view of what the Financial Secretary rightly said about the time that will be required at some period to give clearance on the complicated cases, and the fact that he has been unable to accept the 30-day limit for the Board to give its answer, it follows that there will be occasions when there will be longer periods before the Board is able to give its answer. Thirty days is still some 4 per cent. of the total available period and, if we stretch it out to twice that, we are up to 8 per cent. or 9 per cent. of the avialable period within which the development has to start. That seems to be using up a large proportion of the two year discretion in obtaining the clearance from the Board.<br><br>
There is every indication that the earlier the application can go in, the better for all concerned. If the application can go in—</span></p>
<p>The Chairman's <i>attention having been called to the fact that seven Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seven Members being present the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was saying, in conclusion, that we must be sure that the applicant, even if he is possessed only of a conditional contract of his interest in the land, is still able to apply to the Board for clearance under this clause.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman drew distinctions between a conditional and an unconditional contract. Such a contract is one to acquire, where all that is left to be done is for a buyer to pay the price and for a conveyance to be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 980</span>
executed. That is what I consider to be an unconditional contract, and is an interest in land under this legislation anyway.<br><br>
In clause 45 "an interest in land" is defined and the clause deals with the right to acquire, which is conditional on the other person's ability to grant the estate or interest in question.<br><br>
In other words, where the only condition is the condition that the other party should give good title, then it is what I take it the hon. Gentleman means—it is an unconditional contract. The owner of that interest can make the necessary application to the Board and be within the provisions of Clause 18.<br><br>
The problem is in relation to what is normally known as a conditional contract in the sense that there may be other conditions to be fulfilled before the sale goes through, and one condition very often is that planning permission should have been obtained. It is not unusual for land to be sold on condition that planning permission should be obtained. That is a conditional contract, and my advice is that that conditional contract is not an interest in land, for purposes of the legislation, until the condition is satisfied, when it becomes an unconditional contract in this language.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to secure that a conditional contract should enable the owner of that contract to apply for what is loosely called "a clearance" under Clause 18, whereby the Inland Revenue would then be obliged to tell him that, if he goes through with the deal and develops within two years, he will pay no tax. That is, what we are required to do basically<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman's argument was most persuasive on the face of it, but if he thinks about it a bit longer—I mean no disrespect—he will see that it could lead to great difficulties, because Clause 18 is not a clearance procedure. We may talk about it as a clearance, but it is not a general clearance for transactions. In the income tax legislation there is provision for a clearance. There are anti-avoidance provisions for clearance where one would write in explaining what is intended and asking for clearance—the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South - West (Mr. Budgen) would possibly take exception to that kind of procedure—and the Revenue either clears it or does not, and gives no reasons very often, depending on the form of legislation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1095">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 981</span>
Clause 18 is not a clearance procedure in that way. I am not making a debating point, but Clause 18 says that if a person acquires land and develops it within two years no tax will be charged if the amount to be charged is insignificant. We discussed the meaning, or lack of meaning, of the word "significant" earlier. That is a perfectly sensible way of dealing with things, because the man has actually acquired the land. If we were to go further along the way desired by the hon. Gentleman, the Inland Revenue, the Board and the people in the middle would be brought into a multitude of transactions. In every case, before the sale went through, they would be required to give a clearance and everything would be held up until that clearance was given.<br><br>
Clause 18 would change character completely. There would be far more work to be done for a start, and it is not meant to operate in that way. That may not be a satisfactory way to reply, but the sale might not go through, the condition might not be fulfilled, and then another application would be made in relation to another conditional contract.<br><br>
I suggest, therefore, that this would create far more uncertainty, far more administrative work and would not meet the point which we are trying to meet, which is that we can give clearance where an actual purchase has taken place, where a person has decided to buy the land and go ahead with the development but wants to know whether he will have to pay tax.<br><br>
That is the sort of situation with which we are concerned. We do not want to take it further—to a hypothetical situation very often, to the point where there is a conditional contract on the conditional planning permission, which might not happen for years, and the Board is asked to form a judgment on a situation which may not be completed. Quite often the condition might not be fulfilled, and permission not be granted.<br><br>
That would change Clause 18 for the worse, in my opinion, because we would then need a real clearance situation and we do not want to impose that additional administrative burden in that situation. I see the hon. Gentleman's point, but I cannot go along with him.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister has so narrowed down the effect of Clause 18. I have used the word
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 982</span>
"clearance" all the way through our debates on this clause, and thought I was right to do so. I wish that it was a clearance clause.<br><br>
I am sure I should be called to order at once if I were being tedious and repetitious but this morning we seem to have got into a pattern of my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) moving, the Minister replying, and my getting up to complain about the Minister's reply. But I hope that I am putting a new gloss on to the debate. Certainly I sought to do so in this case where I was convinced that we were dealing with a clearance clause, which was to help people intending to develop, and so that they did not have to go through the process of becoming owners of an interest in land before they could obtain some information from the Board as to whether there would be payable tax.<br><br>
The Minister said that this would give an enormous amount of extra work. This will be of great advantage to those who may eventually be charged with or relieved from tax, and it is not the sort of work that does not go on in other spheres when one is about to purchase "developable"—if that is a good word—property. This goes on every day with local authorities when those intending to purchase property make a planning application to see whether they will be able to develop it.<br><br>
This is on exactly the same principle. If those under conditional contract—let us say, a contract to complete the purchase—have planning permission and are extending it that little bit further with the assistance of the Board of Inland Revenue, if they have planning permission they are not going to be charged. In those cases it would not apply very much, because if they do not have planning permission when they enter into this contract and get it later, it will probably take it outside the sphere of being a significant amount of increase in the value of development.<br><br>
There will not be that many cases. I imagine the process might well be that the contract would be conditional upon the purchaser's trying to ascertain whether, if he goes ahead with development at once—the words in the clause are—"if the project were to be begun forthwith"—he would be liable to tax. This may mean all the difference in the question of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1096">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 983</span>
development—whether or not he goes ahead.<br><br>
It also meets, to some extent, the case which we argued on a previous amendment, that two years is a short period of time if these applications can be made at the time when the prospective developer is still under contract to purchase. It will give more leeway, and possibly relief, to those seeking to get the benefit of Clause 18.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
If the Government have decided to put Clause 18 in the Bill at all, and have decided that it is right to give relief on development within two years of acquisition if there is no substantial payment of tax arising, I ask the Minister not to be niggling over it. Let him give that relief wherever it is reasonable to give it and treat the clause as a form of clearance and not cut it down as he did in his speech.<br><br>
The Minister disappointed me. I thought we had gone a long way in our previous discussions on the clause. I appreciate that Ministers have not given away very much, but at least I thought that we had impressed them on the use of the clause to the proposed developer and that one ought not to put a lot of tripwires in the way of getting relief from it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I continue the pattern we seem to have developed this morning. My right hon. Friend says that he rises very often to express dissatisfaction with the Minister's reply and on this occasion he quite rightly expressed more dissatisfaction than on any of the earlier amendments. I usually rise after my right hon. Friend to give my reaction to the Minister's reply and fully support what my right hon. Friend has said. Like him, I found the Minister's reply the most disappointing we have had from the Government.<br><br>
As my right hon. Friend said, we have been treating this clause as a clearance clause. The Minister said he was not making a semantic point in saying that it was not a clearance procedure, but in a sense he was making a semantic point. I think, too, that the developers would regard this as a clearance procedure and a procedure intended to avoid unnecessary work on their side which, inevitably, would avoid unnecessary work for the Board.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 984</span>
The Minister's argument against accepting this point seemed to rest on the idea that it would make more work for the Board. I am very dubious whether he has a valid point here. Obviously, it would raise the possibility of work being done by the Board at an earlier stage in the process of a development than if this process were not to be allowed. But the great advantage seems to be that, if one entered into a contract which was conditional upon clearance from the Board, one is able to establish at the time before the contract becomes unconditional that the price being paid is the full price.<br><br>
One of the main areas of possible argument between the Board and developers will be whether the base price, the price paid for acquisition, was the full price reflecting development value at that time.<br><br>
As I said earlier, valuation is, in part, an art and there is a great deal of judgment involved in it. In my experience, if one is to get the greatest measure of agreement on a valuation problem as between different valuers, it is easier to do so when one is looking at the situation at the time of the valuation. The further away from the date about which one is concerned for valuation and at which one tries to hold the argument, the more scope there is for disagreement as to the comparables which would be most relevant as to the exact state of the market for that particular type of property, the number of potential purchasers or the absence of such purchasers to explain perhaps why house prices seemed rather low. Therefore, it seems to me that, far from involving more work to be done by the Board if this amendment were to be accepted, it is likely to involve less work, because it is not just the number of valuations or applications that will determine the work of the Board, but the complications in determining those applications. If one is able to settle the argument—as I say, I think it is going to be the main cause of argument—relating to whether a clearance should be given, the point will be whether the price to be paid is a full price at the time that it is about to be paid. Those concerned will ask themselves "If we go ahead and complete this contract and make it unconditional and move to completion at the price of £100,000, or whatever it is, is that to be accepted by the Board as being the full price?" This will be of great
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1097">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 985</span>
assistance to the development industry, particularly in house building. I can see that here one will have more occasions when the developer will be thinking If that is accepted as the full price and the whole operation stacks up in this financial way, that is something I can proceed with, and the vendor will be saying that that is the price at which he will sell.<br><br>
If one goes to the Board with a contract conditional on part clearance and gets a clearance at that price, that will be fine; one will have expedited the arrangements. But let us suppose that the Board comes back. It inevitably will come back, because this is not just a matter of the interpretation of the rules and regulations that are in the Bill; it is not just interpretation of the tax law, but it will also be a matter of interpretation, a matter involving considerable judgment, by the valuers. The Board's valuer may come back and say that the price seems rather strange to him and he cannot understand how £100,000 can be put in as the full price. He may think that he cannot accept that and the developer's valuer, who is an expert member I am sure, of the Royal Institution constantly referred to by the Minister of State, if he is a chartered surveyor, will say that he thinks it is a full price and might show three similar deals of which he has knowledge at that price. The developer's valuer might say that the market is very peculiar at the moment. There will be a discussion and perhaps there will be occasions when the Board will say it has considered the matter and perhaps £110,000 would be a price which one would accept as full price to give clearance under this legislation. Then the vendor will go back to the potential developer, look at his figures and see whether the deal will stand the extra 10 per cent. on the land cost and might not have the usual difficulty in persuading the vendor to take the other £10,000.<br><br>
But it will be possible to settle the matter at the time when the evidence is there on which judgment has to be based and when it would be easiest for the Board's valuers to reach an agreement with the applicant's valuers as to whether this is a matter which could be granted clearance. I support my right hon. Friend in the disappointment he expressed with the Minister's reply, which seemed seriously to diminish the value of the clause in minimising the obstacles to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 986</span>
development which are inherent in a tax of this nature.<br><br>
To secure that clearance should be obtained, and the deal be done for the purpose of land development at a full price and go ahead with the minimum of delay and the minimum of uncertainty, I ask the Minister to look at this again. I do not think that he was suggesting that there was any legal obstacle or any special reason why this amendment should not be accepted, other than the fact that it would involve too many applications to the Board and give them more work to do.<br><br>
The final minor point that I should like to make is that, as the Minister of State rightly says, the words "or unconditional" in the amendment are superfluous. They are almost explanatory words drawing the difference between a conditional and an unconditional contract. As Clause 45 makes clear, an unconditional contract is an interest in land for the purposes of the Bill. Therefore, we do not need those words. It is a conditional contract. As my right hon. Friend rightly said, it is the conditional contract which is conditional upon planning and clearance under Clause 18 of the development land tax with which we are most concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may try to amplify my earlier explanation, which seems to have caused some difficulty. I will withdraw the word "clearance", if that makes it easier, or I will say that this is a different type of clearance from other clearances. The point that I was trying to make was that this is different. The hon. Gentleman asked me if there was any legal reason. I will come to a reason which, although not a legal reason, comes close to being one. He said that he could see no reason why we could not accept this amendment.<br><br>
We are concerned here with acquisition of an interest in land. The right hon. Gentleman referred to two years: he said that two years might not be sufficient and that it should, perhaps, be longer than two years. Once we get into the area of conditional contracts we are no longer talking about acquisition of interest in land. For the purposes of this legislation, a conditional contract is not an acquisition of interest in land.<br><br>
Therefore, this clause is drafted on the basis that if within two years the developer commenced the development, and if it is within two years of acquiring the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1098">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 987</span>
interest in land, he will get the clearance. But when we import into the clause the notion of the conditional contract, which is never in the legislation treated as an interest in land, we are going much further and changing the basis of the clause.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman met the point when he talked about within two years of acquisition. This means two years of acquisition of an interest in land, and not two years of an acquisition of something which is not an interest in land. The whole basis of the clause is that one assumes immediately after the acquisition of that interest an immediate deemed disposal. For purposes of the clause one assumes at that point of time that immediately the developer acquired his interest in land he then starts a project of material development. One has to assume that, and, having assumed that, if at that point of time there would not have been any development gain no tax is payable.<br><br>
But if we import into the clause the notion of acquiring something which is not an interest in land, how can we then assume immediately after the acquisition of the interest a deemed disposal of it? It does not make any sense at all. A developer cannot, in the very nature of things, develop when all he has is a conditional contract, which does not give him a right even to go on to the land because planning permission has not been given. How can one assume at that point of time a deemed disposal and say that within two years if there is not going to be any tax no tax is repayable? It is impossible to do that kind of calculation or make that kind of assumption.<br><br>
We are talking about two different things. We are talking about acquiring a contract which is not within the legislation at all. That is the point that I was trying to make. We are dealing with a completely different animal because the whole basis of the clause is that one assumes immediately after the developer acquires the asset, which enables him to develop the land, that development will take place. If on that assumption there is no tax payable, there will be no tax payable if he does not develop within two years of that point in time.<br><br>
However, when we start relating the two years to the conditional contract then we are in an entirely different situation. We cannot make that kind of assumption, because it makes no sense. If
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 988</span>
I enter into a contract to buy land on condition that planning permission shall be given, and I buy that land and I enter into that contract on that condition; how can I assume at that point in time that a deemed disposal will take place? How can I ever reach any meaningful figures as to what any development land tax may be at that time? I do not know—development might not take place. There are no values to work on. That is my difficulty. I am sorry that I did not make it clear at the beginning. I am sure that members of the Committee appreciate the difficulty of making that kind of assumption, in relation to a contract which has no meaning, for the purposes of this legislation.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman talked about a conditional contract, and a conditional grant in planning permission. I accept entirely that this is the way in which these things are done. One enters into a contract on condition. However, the amendment does not talk about that point. I am not criticising the amendment, because I do not think it can be done. It does not just talk about a contract conditional on granting planning permission. It talks about conditional contracts, and a contract can be conditional for all sorts of reasons: Contracts contain a number of conditions. They are not all simple contracts where the property can be conveyed six weeks afterwards.<br><br>
So we are dealing, not only with that kind of case, but with a whole range of conditions. That problem, added to what I have suggested, would make acceptance of the amendment extremely difficult, and I do not see how it could operate within the basis of Clause 18.<br><br>
I could not honestly tell the Committee that I would give the matter serious consideration, for the hon. Gentleman may have more arguments and tell me that what I said was not a problem. If he does that, I will consider again what he says.</span></p>
<p>12.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted with the Minister's speech, as he disclosed that he had completely misunderstood our amendment. But I am sure that when he does understand it, he will accept it.<br><br>
The amendment has nothing to do with two years' acquisition it would not alter the clause in that respect. It has nothing whatever to do with the date of acquisition. It is purely a procedural amendment. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1099">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 989</span>
Bill says that an application can be made only by the owner of an interest in land. Even when the owner makes that application, the Board will have a hypothetical case, because it has to give its notification on the basis that the projects begins forthwith. So the Board already has to deal with that hypothetical situation.<br><br>
The situation is no more hypothetical than if a person who, for the moment, is not the owner of the interest in land, says "I am going to become the owner forthwith. I am going to start this project forthwith. To that extent, I come within the clause, but have not got the ownership at that time. "It is purely procedural; unless he gets the ownership, unless he begins the project right away, he does not get the relief under the clause.<br><br>
We only want to be able to get over this technicality—that the application must be made by someone who has already completed his purchase. We want to provide the procedural ease of making this application.<br><br>
If the Board, by this means, will have a longer period for consideration, it will be better for both sides. The applicant will not have made the outlay of purchasing the land and then finding that he will not get relief under Clause 18, and the Board will be able to consider the position even before the transfer of the property has taken place.<br><br>
I want to stress that this is a procedural point. It does not alter the provisions of the clause, except on this one aspect of the case, that there may be more applications which do not go through to the intended project. I ask the Minister to help the producer to some extent by putting the services of the Inland Revenue at the services of the man who is about to buy the property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I, too, am delighted at the Minister's reply. Instead of being what seemed to me an unreasonable reply, like his first one, it seemed to advance a good reason why he found difficulty about accepting the amendment. As I hope that I am a reasonable man, I am hopeful that there could be the possibility of agreement on this.<br><br>
The Minister's worry seems to be that, if there is a conditional contract, the conditions are not specified in the amendment. There could be conditions relating to the carrying out by other parties of works
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 990</span>
which would affect the project or the viability of the development of the project. There could be conditions affecting something altogether extraneous to the normal course of land development—the pound to recover a certain value against the dollar, the Tories to win the next Election or some other good news could be required as one of the conditions for the contract.<br><br>
The Minister did not make it absolutely clear, but reading between the lines I think that what follows is that there could be certain conditions attaching to a contract which could make the valuation of the deemed disposal required for the purposes of the clause very different. One could have a conditional contract and, if a clearance were being granted under the clause, one would have to assume a deemed disposal of something which someone did not have. One would have to make assumptions which are not specified.<br><br>
The obvious answer to this would be to say that one would have to assume for the purposes of the calculation that all the conditions had been satisfied. That in itself is probably not sufficient, because it would perhaps not be clear in certain cases what would be the consequences of the conditions being satisfied and it would certainly make the valuation problem more difficult if one were having to make a lot of wide-ranging assumptions about certain matters in order to determine the valuation.<br><br>
A possible way of meeting the difficulty, and one which I hope will appeal to the Minister, because it is important for the avoidance of uncertainty, administrative complications and delay that we find a way round the obstacle, is to look for a formula whereby, for the purposes of the clause only, and I stress that because it is not suggested that a conditional contract becomes an interest in land under—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's amendment says that and very clearly.<br><br>
The amendment says:
<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of subsection (3) above",</p></blockquote>
which is the procedure section, not the merit section.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for making the point. It is already there, but I was trying to amplify the purpose of the amendment. For the purpose solely of this clause, a contract that was conditional upon
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1100">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 991</span>
nothing other than the granting of planning permission and clearance under this clause might refute the reasons for refusal advanced by the Minister in his second speech and which basically were fair reasons. It seems to me that, if one limited the conditions that could be attached to a contract to those two conditions, then there would not be the problems of the valuation of the deemed disposal to which the Minister referred. If we were able to devise a formula which stated that only conditions relating to the granting of planning permission and clearance under the clause were permissible, I wonder whether that would meet the Minister's argument and enable us to arrive at an amendment to meet the very important point we are arguing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue the debate but it is an important point that the hon. Gentleman has raised. I take his point. He says one could have a conditional contract that was conditional just on the planning permission. He asked whether that would meet my argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: And a formula.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think it would. Although I should like to say—that it would, I do not think that it would. The point I made about conditions in the contract was only one part of the argument.<br><br>
The other part of the argument, and my difficulty at the moment, is that I do not agree with the right hon. Gentleman or the hon. Gentleman that this is a procedural technical matter. The right hon. Gentleman said that it was just a matter of procedure to enable applications to be made. I cannot see how it helps anyone to assume a hypothetical sale or hypothetical deemed disposal at a point of time in respect of a piece of land for which planning permission has been given.<br><br>
One has to assume that planning permission would be given, because, if permission is not given, it will not help those who have applied for clearance. The hon. Gentleman wants to know what will happen if there is planning permission. There is then a further assumption. One has to assume that at that point in time, in respect of that piece of land for which
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 992</span>
there is no planning permission, when the contract is entered into, planning permission will be given, and the assumptions have to be followed right through. Without doing that, I do not see how we could help the developer. We are entering upon assumptions and formulae.<br><br>
Perhaps I have not understood the amendment correctly. The right hon. Gentleman may be right. It may be a technical procedural matter and I have not understood it. In view of the high regard in which I hold the right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Gentleman, and in view of the fact that they have obviously had representations on this matter, I am prepared to consider it on the basis that if it is purely a technical procedural matter, we may be able to do something, but if it goes into the substance of the clause I shall not be able to meet them.<br><br>
Further, it would create considerably more work; and staffing costs have to be taken into account. However, subject to those two points, namely, staff costs and formulae, I am happy to look at it again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's undertaking to look at it. I am concerned that the points he made are conditional upon this contract.<br><br>
To deal with the question of staff costs first, I should like him to bear in mind a point that I made earlier, namely, that if the valuation complexities can be got out of the way at the earliest point, when there is likely to be less difficulty and one is not looking back to the previous year and wondering what the circumstances were then, the amount of time spent will be reduced, even if there are a few more cases to be looked at.<br><br>
On the other point, the hon. Gentleman still seemed to be concerned that, even if there was a condition relating to the grant of planning permission, assumptions had to be made which would make valuation very difficult. I do not think that is so or that a simple straightforward condition saying that planning permission be granted for development specified would present any difficulties for the valuers. That is the sort of assumption they have to make, anyhow, when buying land. They have to consider what development would be permissible on the land, because that must be considered in the valuation.<br><br>
I suggest that we arrive at a variation of this amendment which would allow a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1101">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 993</span>
contract that would be conditional on two sorts of conditions to qualify under this clause. The two conditions are, first, planning permission and, secondly, clearance under the terms of the clause.<br><br>
I hope the Minister will find it possible to do that. In the light of what he has said, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
