INTERACTION OF DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX WITH OTHER TAXES</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule, as amended, be the Sixth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We had a long discussion on Thursday on the technical aspects of the interaction of taxes. I have been reading the OFFICIAL REPORT to pick out the various points where the Minister showed his generosity and his warm heart and also to consider some of the comments from his ice-cool brain. I should like to refer to one or two points. In two cases they straddle Clause 33 and Schedule 6 and we had amendments down in both places, so I hope that it is in order to deal with these even though the main debate took place under Clause 33.<br><br>
The first relates to Amendment No. 215 to Clause 33 and Amendment No. 274 to Schedule 6, and the discussion we had about Section 81. I do not want to refer to this at length or to go into the arguments again, but after some consultations I am advised that the representations which were made about this had underlying them genuine non-avoidance cases even though they may not have been put in this way to the Revenue. I hope, therefore, that this can be reconsidered.<br><br>
The second point is the more important one. It concerns the discussions that we had on Amendment No. 380 to Clause 33 and Amendment No. 390 to Schedule 6. These were the amendments dealing with Section 488 and the possibility of interaction with development land tax. We saw dangers that the accumulation of taxes might lead to a charge at a very high rate. The Minister gave us some assurance that it would not normally be the case that the Revenue would seek to press an assessment under
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1280</span>
Section 488 if it could be shown that development land tax had applied to the underlying transaction, or at least not to aggregate the two. However, I think that there are still some points of doubt about this.<br><br>
The Minister said this:
<br><blockquote><p>"On the first point, therefore—the transfer of land—the position is that the tax would be deductible in computing the Case VI charge under Schedule D."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee J,</i> 13th May 1976; c. 1221.]</p></blockquote>
He went on to make further comments about this in columns 1223 and 1224, concluding that "There is no problem"—an attractive way of summing up the situation, but I wonder whether it is precisely true.<br><br>
The difficulty seems to arise in that the Bill provides generally that development land tax is not allowable as a deduction against other taxes. The reference, I think, is Clause 33(2). This may have been a slip of the tongue and perhaps the Minister was actually referring to that part of the value to which development land tax applied. I am not sure. He may have been referring to chargeable realised development value on which development land tax was charged. It may be that he meant exactly what he said, but if I understand it correctly this would be the only case in the Bill where development land tax itself was to be treated as a specific deduction for the case of other taxes.<br><br>
Clause 33(2) relates to profits or gains, and there might be something in the definition which deals with that point. In column 1223 the Minister quoted a part of Section 488 dealing with profits or gains under Case I of Schedule D, and he later cross-referenced that to the computation of tax under Case VI of Schedule D. That illustrates the fact that we need precise guidance. Even if we cannot have a specific relief against Section 488, we need to know exactly what we are talking about.<br><br>
My next point relates to Amendment No. 265 to Schedule 6. In moving that amendment I referred to cases where there was interaction between development land tax and development gains charge. The Minister answered the point by referring to provisions in Clause 35 regarding current use value as a means, in practice, of ensuring that in one of the cases I mentioned there would not be a tax both to development gains charge
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1257">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1281</span>
and development land tax on the same increment in value. That was a satisfactory answer. However, the Minister made this important comment:
<br><blockquote><p>"Perhaps I should add that the Schedule 6 offset against the chargeable gain will, first of all, go against the development gain element—there will be a top slice relief first."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee J,</i> 13th May 1976; c. 1240.]</p></blockquote>
The Minister then elaborated on that.<br><br>
I was not able from reading the Bill to find exactly where this was provided. It is not clear to me, and it would be of assistance to know whether this is a provision of the Bill as it stands or whether it is a gloss on the method of interpretation which the Minister has given to us. If the latter, it is important that it should be formalised so that it is well understod that in cases relating to Clause 36, as well as to Clause 35, there is a proper provision for offset. The Committee would be grateful for further elucidation on that point from the Minister.<br><br>
I do not want to go further than that on the detailed points. We raised a number of topics on which we were disappointed, but, equally, we found that the Government's thinking had moved towards our own on a number of others.<br><br>
However, I want to make one very important point which has run as something of a theme through our discussions. The rates of the development land tax make it so much more important that we carefully define the boundaries of the tax for the purposes of interaction with others. Where one is dealing with taxes at lower rates, even capital gains tax and corporation tax, the difference is not great. Here we are dealing with taxes where two-thirds of the total value is the lowest rate at which the tax will be applied, where 80 per cent. is the standard rate, and it is expected to rise to 100 per cent.<br><br>
Therefore, all the areas of doubt and all the precedents which have been called in aid from the operation of other taxes need to be looked at again because of the higher rates at which this tax will be assessed. Our discussions last Thursday on advance corporation tax illustrated that there comes a point where one cannot go on repeating the provisions which have been applicable in other cases. If one reduces the amount of corporation
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1282</span>
tax payable by a whole sector of companies, the ACT provisions will bear more hard on those companies as a result of the introduction of this tax than was presumably intended at the outset. A similar case could be made in relation to Section 488.<br><br>
One final question. No doubt the Treasury has carefully considered this. Are there any points at which the adjustments to capital transfer tax contained in the Finance Bill affect either the operation or the detail—or even the general principles—of the development land tax, so far as the two taxes interact? It would be helpful to have a comment from the Minister on that even if the comment is, as I hope, that we need not be concerned about the consequences of the changes in the capital transfer tax which are now proposed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first point was on Section 81. I am advised that the Inland Revenue was told, or the accountants specially suggested, that there could be genuine cases that would be caught under Section 81. However, my information is that they have not yet produced specific cases of that kind. If they do, we shall look at the matter, to see whether we can avoid catching genuine cases.<br><br>
I was then asked about the question of deducting liability under Section 488 from the DLT liability. I am bound to say that there is a slight problem here. The argument I adduced in Committee was that, because of the "just and reasonable" apportionment in Section 488, the DLT paid would be taken into account in computing Section 488 tax. Indeed, that would override the provision in the clause that generally there shall be no deduction from other taxes in respect of DLT. Section 488 talks specifically about computing on the basis of what is just and reasonable. I recognise that there is some difficulty here. It will probably work out all right in practice, but it is not entirely clear from the words of the two sections that this result would strictly be achieved. I accept that that is not an entirely satisfactory situation, and I shall certainly look at that point again.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made a valid point on the amendment earlier on in relation to Section 488, in that the reason for some provisions now relating to the taxation of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1258">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1283</span>
property—I must choose my words carefully—may to some extent have disappeared because of the introduction of this tax. The legislation was drawn up piecemeal to avoid various loopholes in an age when we had capital gains tax and a tax on profits, and there was the grey area in between. Section 488 and other sections were meant to stop those loopholes. We now have this Bill, and it might seem logical that the other sections should be less important.<br><br>
The difficulty is that there are still different rates of tax. We have a rate of 66⅔ per cent. under DLT up to £150,000, and the top rates of income tax are higher, so one could not forget all the other sections and deal only with DLT. Moreover, the rates may be different in future.<br><br>
I take the hon. Gentleman's point that some provisions which at one time were vital may not now be vital because of interaction with DLT. We shall look at that general point.<br><br>
The third point that the hon. Gentleman made related to Amendment No. 265—the top slice relief against development gains charge. I am advised that it is not necessary to have any specific provision, as the relief operates in that way, anyway. The calculation of a development gain by way of deducting something from the chargeable gain is the way in which the relief works. If we reduce the chargeable gain by the DLT slice, that automatically reduces the development gain. In other words, it goes automatically against the development gain and is a deduction from the development gain.<br><br>
I put a gloss on that by saying that it is a top slice relief. It is not a top slice relief in the sense that it is written into the Bill as a top slice relief, but if the development gain is charged at 83 per cent. the effect is that it is a top slice relief because it is a relief against that higher liability tax. I am advised that it is not necessary for the legislation to provide for that, because it works like that automatically.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I think that deals with the three points that the hon. Gentleman made. Unfortunately, the schedule is complicated because of the involvement of other taxes, but we have sought to ensure that there will be no double taxation relief for taxpayers who, no doubt, will feel aggrieved at paying a higher rate of tax
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1284</span>
and development land tax. At least, there will be no question of their paying two lots of taxes on the same gain. But, because of the plethora of taxes we have, it is inevitable that the schedule is complicated. We shall keep the matter under review, and if there are any anomalies or difficulties we shall seek to put them right.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman asked me whether there was anything relating to this in the Finance Bill. I am advised that there is nothing in the Finance Bill in relation to development land tax, although there is a small provision in relation to development gains charge. That equates the position for development gains charge with development land tax in relation to the slice exemption. We discussed this subject previously. The £10,000 exemption here is a slice exemption, which was not the case with development gains charge. We think that the slice exemption is a better way of dealing with the matter, and the Finance Bill contains provision to bring the development gains charge into line with DLT.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his explanation, and also for his admission that it is necessary to have a further look at the Section 488 problem. I do not expect an answer now, but I should be grateful if he would write to me to amplify and give a reference for his comments that the Bill already provides offset in the case which I raised on Amendment No. 265. There were three cases which I mentioned, of which the second was a "no gain, no loss disposal", and the third concerned a development which
<br><blockquote><p>"started before the appointed day for the purposes of development land tax, under outline planning permission, and then detailed planning permission is obtained after the appointed day".—[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee J,</i> 13th May, 1976; c. 1237.]</p></blockquote>
As the Minister has taken advice on this matter, no doubt it is true that the way the Bill works in relation to Clause 36 situations already provides the offset which I have asked for. But in doing the calculations, it has not been easy to satisfy oneself that that is so. I shall be grateful if the Minister could give the point of reference and an explanation.</span></p>

Clause 34</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TERMINATION OF TAX ON DEVELOPMENT GAINS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 180, in page 53, leave out lines 19 to 29.<br><br>
I move the amendment in a spirit of great co-operation and helpfulness. The intention of the amendment is to simplify, certainly for an individual taxpayer, what could be an extremely complicated situation in trying to work out those limited—perhaps in practice, not so limited for the next few years—circumstances in which he has to pay DGT as opposed to DLT. It could turn out to be an immensely complicated matter for an ordinary person to fathom, particularly as the wording of the Bill stands at present.<br><br>
I should make it clear, first, that under the subsection which the amendment seeks to remove, if a deemed disposal has been made before the appointed day, the subsequent disposal after the appointed day will be subject to DGT. That is our reading of the meaning of this subsection.<br><br>
I want to make two points. First, since a subsequent disposal would, if the subsection were removed, be subject to DLT, in our minds there is no need to confuse the issue by continuing the DGT provisions. However, there is a more fundamental point here to which, if I can catch your eye later on, Mr. Crawshaw, we shall return. It is a philosophical point. DGT was never meant to apply in a deemed disposal situation. Indeed, I think that a basic difference between DLT and DGT in a very fundamental philosophical situation is that DGT was meant to apply to a real gain situation and not to a hypothetical gain situation. Therefore, on grounds of consistency with previous legislation, we would argue that DGT should not apply in a deemed disposal situation. The amendment seeks to make this difficult piece of legislation simpler for those who are to be the victims.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is to some extent a probing amendment to ensure that in cases where there is a disposal after the appointed day the rules are not so complicated that there could be two lots of taxes, although interaction relief might apply.<br><br>
I can ssure that hon. Gentleman that the purpose of Clause 34, and indeed of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1286</span>
other clauses, is to charge to development gains charge various gains that accrue after the appointed day which would not be charged to development land tax and on which, if we did not continue with development gains charge proposals for a transitional period, there would be no charge to tax at all. In some such cases there might be a conditional contract, and the rules regarding conditional contracts are treated differently. The definition is different for development land tax purposes than for capital gains tax purposes.<br><br>
For example, for development land tax a conditional contract which is conditional only on completion and payment of the purchase price, is treated as an interest in land acquired at the moment of the conditional contract. For the purposes of DLT, any such acquisition which occurs before the appointed day is outside the DLT rules. On the other hand, for capital gains tax rules—and, indeed, for development gains charge rules, which follow the capital gains tax rules—conditional contracts are not treated in the same way.<br><br>
If we were to abolish development gains charge in relation to everything that happened after the appointed day, there could have been a pre-appointed day situation which was exempt from development land tax in a conditional contract situation, but under the capital gains tax rules that would throw up a gain later after the appointed day. Without a development gains charge, that gain would be charged to capital gains tax, although it would have been a development gain, because the development gains charge would not apply.<br><br>
It is to cover such a situation in the main that these complicated clauses are there. I admit that I find them complicated. They are not to impose two lots of tax in relation to what happens after the appointed day. However, there are some cases where there will not be a DLT charge, but without the development gains charge there would be no charge at all, except, possibly, a capital gains charge in relation to what happened after the appointed day. These clauses are intended to deal with that kind of situation.<br><br>
I do not know if that explanation will satisfy the hon. Gentleman. I am sorry that it is so complicated, but I can assure him that there is no question of two lots of tax being paid or that it is necessary to have interaction relief. We are dealing
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1260">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1287</span>
with situations where there will be no DLT and we have to preserve the development gains charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not possible to understand Clause 34(2) without looking at Clause 44(6). The two are interrelated. Clause 44(6) defines that the conditional contract for the purposes of DLT shall be taken as having been unconditional—that is, it is put forward by the Revenue that the date the contract becomes binding is the disposal date. That is the general procedure throughout the Bill.<br><br>
In the circumstances I find it hard to understand why there should be the exception in this case. Given that the conditional contract is treated as biting for the purposes of the tax at the moment of disposal, I am unable to understand why there is a special exemption in Clause 34(2).<br><br>
The equity of this matter is not clear. Some taxpayers will be advantaged by it and some will be disadvantaged. For example, a taxpayer who is liable to income tax and therefore to development gains tax will find himself slightly worse off under these provisions, if he is paying tax at the full rate of 83 per cent., than he would if he were charged development land tax if the exemption under Clause 34(2) did not exist. On the other hand, a builder or a company which is chargeable not to development gains but only to corporation tax rates would be substantially worse off if the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) to delete this provision were accepted, and the exemption for the purposes of development gains tax would be overturned.<br><br>
There is no easy answer to this question. I am at a loss to understand why this specific change has been made here, given that throughout the rest of the Bill the Revenue has initiated the concept of the date of a contract becoming binding at disposal date. Under Clause 44(6), on the disposal of an interest in land under a conditional contract entered into before 13th September 1974, the contract is to be treated as if it had never been conditional—that is, that it had been finalised at the moment of the contract being entered into. That would be a ludicrous situation from the point of view of the purposes of acquiring land because the purpose of a conditional contract is to enable both the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1288</span>
vendor and the purchaser to pull out if the condition is not satisfied—that is, if planning permission is not obtained.<br><br>
My hon. Friend is right to raise this matter, but on balance it is probably better to let the Bill stand as it is.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has given an explanation of the purpose of the clause. I have two questions for him, against the background that we recognise that transitional provisions in taxation, like transitional provisions in other matters, often cause complications. I hope that he will agree that the Revenue should bend over backwards to ensure fairness in these circumstances.<br><br>
If the intention is as the Minister says—and I am sure it is—that one pays one tax or the other, is there not an easier way of making this clear than that which he has found so far in the Bill? Secondly, with the background that we ought to try to be as fair as possible to the taxpayer during these transitional provisions, would it not be possible to consider a provision whereby where there was a contract on one side of the appointed day and a completion on the other—whether that contract be binding or conditional—the taxpayer could choose which set of provisions under which to be taxed? As my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has pointed out some would be disadvantaged one way and some would be disadvantaged the other.<br><br>
We are reassured by the Minister's constant references to the geniality and generosity of the Revenue. I wonder whether he would prove that point by allowing the taxpayer to choose under which provisions he should be taxed in these few transitional cases which are awkward to place in one set or the other.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) gave an excellent explanation of the clause, better than that which I gave. He referred to Clause 44(6), which deals with the awful difficulty of conditional contracts. This is where the problem may seem to arise. But under development land tax legislation a conditional contract which is not really conditional, except that it is conditional upon conveyance and the money being paid, is treated as an interest in land for DLT purposes. However, if it is acquired before the appointed day DLT does not apply.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1261">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1289</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has spoken of a conditional contract which is not really conditional because it is conditional only upon conveyance, or completion and payment of the money. Surely that is not a conditional contract under any normal usage of the term?</span></p>
<p>11 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what the normal usage is in this kind of situation. Let us call it not a conditional contract but a contract conditional upon payment of purchase price. [<i>Interruption.</i>] There are rumblings from The Law Society—I shall give way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: One cannot call a contract conditional merely because it is conditional on completion. It is itself a fully whole, entire contract—a contract to complete. It is conditional only if one can set it aside through some fact arising.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is quite right. The draftsman in Clause 44 draws a distinction, and I apologise to the Committee for getting it wrong.<br><br>
We are concerned here with contracts for the acquisition of land. If there is an acquisition and disposal of land, that is the end of the matter for the purpose of DLT. The rule could be different in the case of development gains charge, and it is to preserve that charge in relation to something that happened before the appointed day that the clause has been introduced. If there is a disposal after the appointed day and development gains charge has been abolished there will be no charge to tax except to capital gains tax. The clause was introduced to preserve that kind of charge. It is transitional, complicated and difficult but it is not intended that two lots of tax will be charged. It is merely to cover the kind of case that straddles the appointed day in relation to development gains charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take the point that we are talking not about double taxation but about something geared to a particular problem—the conditional contract—which will, because it is aimed at solving that problem, make many people who have engaged in deemed disposal situations before the appointed
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1290</span>
day subject to that tax. Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.<br><br>
We are talking about two different sets of victims. If the person involved in a conditional contract would not pay any tax were it not for the provisions of the Bill, yet many other victims are subjected to an unnecessary situation because they would be subject to DLT, would it not be a good idea to follow the advice offered by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) and allow a dual situation to exist, whereby people could opt for whichever they wanted?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Subsection (2) is not related solely to conditional contracts. I directed my remarks to conditional contracts for two reasons. The first was that they are specifically mentioned on page 32 of the yellow book which describes the subsection. Secondly, they are the obvious examples where difficulty would arise where there is a distinct lapse of time between the time of a deemed disposal—and I am using the phrase not as a term of art but in its legal sense—for the purpose of development land tax and an actual disposal for development gains tax.<br><br>
The problem is that the Bill has introduced an artificial time at which development land tax will bite, as opposed to the actual time development gains tax—a retrospective income tax assessment related to an actual gain—has accrued. As the Minister has pointed out, it would be perfectly possible under subsection (2) for a person to be theoretically assessable to development land tax at one time, in a pre-appointed-day situation, but to development gains tax at another time. I think that it is all right, but the Minister will require his officials to give him fuller explanations of conditional contracts before Report. I should think my hon. Friend would wish to leave the matter there but we may well want to return to it at a later stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman referred to deemed disposals. Clause 34(2) does not deal with deemed disposals Clause 35 deals with material developments started before the appointed day, where it preserves the charge again in relation to the development gains charge, but Clause 34 does not.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1262">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1291</span>
Clause 34, as I have tried to explain, deals with the situation where the rule regarding disposals is different under capital gains tax from development land tax. One such example is in the case of contracts—unconditional contracts, if one can put it that way. There may be other cases, but that is the major case with which we are concerned. The object of the clause is to preserve the charge where the rules are different between DLT and capital gains tax, because, if we did not preserve the charge, tax would be paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: After that explanation, particularly as paraphrased by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), I shall not press the amendment. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As we are talking here about the transitional problems between DGT and DLT, perhaps I may put on record my own feelings at least on the broad issue of comparison between these two taxes. I am sure you will not allow me to be in order for long on this, Mr. Crawshaw, but we are in a sense dealing with the transitional problems between DGT and DLT.<br><br>
I feel it bounden upon me to make the point that the two taxes are different and one regrets that, under the terms of this clause, we are transposing from one tax to the other. As we have already said this morning, and as has been said so many times during our deliberations, DGT was a tax, by and large, on real gains. That, it seems to me, is the way in which taxes should be imposed. It is a clear-cut thing. It does not demand the kind of enormous complexity that this kind of legislation demands, because what we are doing here—and Clause 34 shows the problems we face when moving from one kind of tax to another—is fundamentally moving into a different world where we are taxing hypothetical values.<br><br>
I feel that this point in the "clause stand part" debate, makes it bounden upon me to make reference to the fact that I find that the concept of moving to a tax on hypothetical values is intolerable. My extreme views on this may not be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1292</span>
shared by all my colleagues, but I suggest that the kinds of problem that we have shown exist under Clause 34 are symbolic of the much wider problem, that we are moving into a totally new form of taxation where we are now taxing nothing which has been gained in reality. Indeed, losses may eventually occur. We have now introduced a totally hypothetical concept of value and taxation, and I wanted at least to register that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire South (Mr. Spicer) that there is this great distinction between DGT and DLT, and Clause 34 will raise many complications, I think, and need much careful understanding. I should have hoped that there could have been some clearer way of drawing a line between the two, although I admit readily that I cannot think of a completely clear way of doing it. However, our debates on this have convinced me that the problems raised are enormous, even if it is only in a small number of cases. In that small number of cases it really will be difficult.<br><br>
In the course of our discussion the Minister said, quite rightly, that disposal for the purpose of development land tax is not the same as disposal for the purpose of either capital gains tax or development gains tax. Indeed the clause says so, but it says so in an extremely brief way in subsection (4). It says blandly—
<br><blockquote><p>"In this section 'disposal' has the same meaning as it has for the purposes of tax on chargeable gains."</p></blockquote>
It gives us no clue as to where to turn it up and find out what it actually means. A definition, and perhaps the 1965 Act, with a later Act thrown in, might help. I submit that a little more help might have been given to identify what is being referred to in this case. There must be some reference to sections in the 1965 Act which would give the reader a clue as to what is meant. We learnt a little of the meaning through the difference between conditional and enforceable contracts. But to read the lines baldly is insufficient. I hope that the Minister will give the reader a little help by putting in extra words of clarification.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support the general remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), and of my hon. Friend the Member for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1263">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1293</span>
Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer). I do not consider that DGT or DLT are the right answers. I believe that we should have a tax on sales of land—that is, actual disposals of land, and not work on deemed disposals. I suggest that we are likely to get into the same sort of mess as did the previous Labour Government over case C in relation to betterment levy. However, that is the Governments worry, not mine.<br><br>
I turn to a slightly different matter. Anyone who has been concerned with taxes on betterment, as has my right hon. Friend, other Committee members, and myself, is aware that the worst difficulties tend to arise during transition periods, namely, when one is moving from one form of taxation to another. I am sure that that is generally accepted. Therefore, I simply ask the Minister that, in assessments of this kind, although clearly the Revenue will act properly in accordance with the law—we should expect that; and we know that the Revenue will act in that way—I hope that the Revenue will show a certain amount of forbearance towards the taxpayer and be prepared to discuss matters at length with him or with his representatives. From our files I am sure that we all know the difficulties and complications that can arise during transition periods. I hope that the Revenue will exercise its normal common sense in dealing with these sort of cases.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) that conditional provisions are difficult. I well remember the difficulty that arose in the Finance Act 1965, when Parliament attempted to put conditional provisions into that Act in relation to the Finance Act 1962, dealing with taxing short-term gains on land. I think that Parliament got it wrong twice before it got it right, but meantime there was considerable confusion. I hope that that will not happen in this case. In some ways the issue is simpler, but clearly, if problems arise, I have no doubt that the Revenue will consider the subject fully and will give taxpayers time to work out the matter.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman asked me whether there could not be a reference to the meaning of "disposal". If my memory is correct, there is no specific definition of "disposal" in the Finance
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1294</span>
Act 1965, although Section 22 extends a non-definition, if I may put it that way. It describes certain things which no one in his right mind would consider to be disposals, although the Act wants them to be considered as disposals. There is no specific definition and this has presented considerable problems.<br><br>
I do not know whether it always helps to have a specific definition. The reason for not having a reference, therefore, is that there is no reference to a specific definition. It might be better to leave the courts to decide what is a disposal. There are so many kinds of disposals, such as disposals of legal interests, of beneficial interests and many others. Therefore, I cannot give an assurance that we shall refer to a section, because there is no section to which we can refer. However, I take the point that whenever possible it is better to refer to a particular section of an Act.</span></p>

EXTENSION OF S.34 IN CERTAIN CASES WHERE DEVELOPMENT BEGAN BEFORE APPOINTED DAY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 383, in page 54, line 16, after 'interest', insert:

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Whereas we may have been under some confusion in the previous debate about the position of easements and deemed disposals, I hope that we shall find that we are under no confusion on this, although with this measure one never really knows whether one is likely to get into a muddle when one stands up to speak.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
The purpose of our amendment is to ensure that a deemed disposal that takes
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1264">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1295</span>
place before the appointed day should not subsequently be subject to DGT. The reasons for putting this forward are the two which I put forward in the debate on the last clause. First, we think it unnecessary that the DLT provisions will later apply when the actual disposal occurs. More importantly, however—and this, again, is a philosophical point, as it were—DGT was never meant to apply in a deemed disposal situation. We think, therefore, that at the very least the Government should maintain the logic and purpose of the DGT legislation through the transitional phases of this very difficult legislation. It is for that reason that we have put down these two amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister replies, it might be helpful to him if I say a few words, not because the content will necessarily be helpful but because it will give him a little more time to study the piece of paper he has in his hand.<br><br>
I have been trying to puzzle out in what circumstances any tax would in fact accrue, as defined in Clause 35(1), which Amendment No. 383 seeks to amend. The situation envisaged in the yellow book seems to be as follows. It refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"material development commenced after 17 December 1973",</p></blockquote>
which is the operative date for the purpose of development gains tax, presumably,
<br><blockquote><p>"but before the Appointed Day"</p></blockquote>
for the purposes of the Bill. Let us say that it occurred, for example, now, on 18th May 1976. It further says that apart from the no gain, no loss provisions
<br><blockquote><p>"no disposal of an interest in that land occurred before the Appointed Day".</p></blockquote>
Let us say, then, that the builder has built the houses but has not actually sold them. When he comes to sell them after the appointed day, in such circumstances
<br><blockquote><p>"the development gains charge will apply …'.</p></blockquote>
I assume that there will not be a development gains charge in such circumstances, because the builder is not for the purposes of development gains charge a taxable person, or rather he would be charged at corporation tax rates, presumably.<br><br>
What I am trying to elicit from the Minister, thinking on my feet, is in what circumstances there actually will be any gain at all which will have to be charged at
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1296</span>
development gains tax rates. The draftsman must have been thinking of some circumstances. He was not just thinking of selling land, after all. He was thinking of a case where material development had actually commenced. We know what material development is. It is defined in the Bill. It means some actual building operation. So some building operation has taken place between 17th December 1973 and 1st August 1976. The disposal takes place after 1st August 1976. Yet development gains charge is to be payable rather than development land tax.<br><br>
I do not disagree at all with that theory. It seems a perfectly reasonable theory. What I am trying to establish is in what circumstances the Government actually think that there will be payment. They must have some ideas in mind. It is the reference to material development having begun which puzzles me. If that was not there, I could see perfectly well what they had in mind, namely, the sale of land to and fro people between two relevant appointed days.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: These amendments seeks to ensure that a DLT deemed disposal taking place after the appointed day will not give rise to a development gains charge in respect of developments commenced after 17th December 1973 and before the appointed day. Amendment No. 384, relating to Clause 36—which we shall deal with later—deals with a no gain, no loss situation.<br><br>
I give hon. Gentlemen this assurance. The amendment is not necessary, because there will be no charge after the appointed day on any deemed disposal in respect of development gains charge, which does not apply to deemed disposals. This clause will not create any development gains charge in relation to deemed disposals.<br><br>
The situation about which we are concerned is that where, before the appointed day, there is a commencement of material development but actual disposal does not take place until after the appointed day. Given that we are abolishing development gains charge, subject to these exceptions, as from the appointed day, and given that if building has commenced on land before the appointed day, and that the betterment value then goes into current use value as a consequence of the start of that building for DLT purposes; then there will be no charge, or very little, to DLT on the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1265">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1297</span>
disposal of that property after the appointed day, because the base value for DLT would include the development value which arose on the original work carried out on the land before the appointed day.<br><br>
The clause is to preserve a charge to tax on a disposal after the appointed day in that kind of situation. If that charge to tax is not preserved, the development of the betterment value would not be taxed to development land tax and, presumably, in many cases could be charged to capital gains tax. Although I take the point made by the hon. Gentleman, in the normal case of a builder I should have thought it would be charged to income tax or corporation tax. However, no doubt there might be cases where that would not be the case, and the charge would then simply be a 30 per cent. capital gains charge instead of a charge of up to 83 per cent. if development gains charge operated in a completely pre-appointed day situation. It is to that kind of situation that this clause refers.<br><br>
However, I take the point made by the hon. Gentleman, and, subject to further advice, I agree that in the case of a builder dealing in land his profit will be taxed through income tax or corporation tax. He will not be charged to DLT, for the reasons I have given, but this clause preserves the development gains charge in those cases where otherwise there would just be a capital gains charge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am most grateful to the Minister. That was a useful explanation.<br><br>
However, I envisage a situation where a builder is involved and the following example might occur. Let us suppose that a piece of land received planning permission, say, 12 months ago—that is, after the development gains tax charge—and the builder made a start, say, today. For some reason, the site might go completely sour, or the builder go into liquidation, and the work grind to a halt and not be restarted for another year, perhaps by a different builder or in different trading circumstances.<br><br>
In such circumstances, after the first appointed day for DLT it could be considered that there had been a rise in the actual development value of the site in that time, so there was no question of taxation under capital gains tax but a question of a tax of fresh betterment. In
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1298</span>
those circumstances, presumably under the Bill as drafted in Clause 35(1), the new owner, or the builder having started on the site again, would be taxable at corporation tax rates on the development gain, assuming that he was a company, but if he was a sole trader he would be chargeable at development gains tax rates. However, in no circumstances would he be charged at development land tax rates. That is my understanding of the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On the basis of what the Minister said, and in view of the explanation again by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), who has been so immensely helpful to the Government this morning, it would be churlish of me not to seek to withdraw the amendment. Consequently, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

EXCLUSION OF S. 24 IN CASE OF CERTAIN INTERESTS ACQUIRED BEFORE APPOINTED DAY</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 266, in page 58, line 14, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'and on which the consideration actually paid exceeds the aggregate of the former's cost of acquisition of the interest and his expenditure on improvements'.</p></blockquote>
I have very little to add to the words on the Amendment Paper, which seem to me to speak for themselves. We want to ensure that in assessing the gain the cost of the interest is added to an expenditure on improvements. This seems perfectly fair and logical and I do not see that I need say anything else to support it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gather that the hon. Gentleman was concerned about Clause 36, especially in the no gain, no loss situation.<br><br>
Clause 36 preserves the development gains charge in certain cases where there is, after the appointed day, a disposal of an interest in land which was acquired before the appointed day by means of a no gain, no loss transaction. The amendment seeks to continue the charge only in cases where the consideration passing in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1266">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1299</span>
the pre-appointed day transaction was more than would have been necessary to achieve the actual no gain, no loss result.<br><br>
The amendment is right in the sense that it highlights the difficulty. Where there is no gain, or where the consideration passing does not in any way create a gain or a loss, the problem does not so much arise. The problem arises when the consideration is more than would be necessary to create a no gain, no loss situation. In other words, let us assume that before the appointed day, a husband transfers property to his wife for capital gains tax purposes. That is a no gain, no loss situation. Whether in actual life the consideration itself would create a no gain, no loss situation, the capital gains tax rules say that in any case, whether or not there is as it were a profit on the transfer, there shall be no capital gains tax. It is that kind of case with which we are concerned. The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was only trying to shake some sense into my head.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has no doubt shaken some DLT into his head. Whether that is shaking sense into one's head, I do not know. Perhaps I should go over that again.<br><br>
If there is a transfer at market value of land between husband and wife before the appointed day, and that land has development value, for capital gains tax purposes—and, indeed for development gains charge purposes, because they follow—there would not have been any disposal or charge, because there was a no gain, no loss situation. The transfer might be for £1. That also would be a no gain, no loss situation, because of the provisions of the capital gains tax legislation.<br><br>
But, if the transfer were at market value, and if these provisions were not in the Bill, on a future sale by the wife after the appointed day the development value which had passed to her would again not be charged to development land tax, because the betterment value would go into the base value as development land tax, and so there would be no charge for tax. The provisions in the clause, in fact, continue the development gains charge in that situation, otherwise the charge would merely be a capital gains charge and would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1300</span>
not be a charge on the betterment at the higher development gains charge rate.<br><br>
The amendment seeks to confine that situation to a transfer at market value between husband and wife, and rightly says that if there is no transfer at market value the problem does not arise. I recognise that, but my advice is that, if the situation were confined in the way that the amendment requires, far greater complications would be produced. There is no question here of paying tax or not paying tax. It is a question of the best way of dealing with it. It would create a greater complication and make it even more difficult, so we think that a simpler and better way to deal with it is as it is in the Bill. The position will arise only when there is a transfer at market value or at a value higher than nominal, and the intention is to preserve the development gains charge on that betterment element, otherwise it would avoid DLT and DGC completely.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My simple amendment seems to have had all sorts of overtones which I had not fully appreciated when I tabled it. However, I think we should reserve our position until we have looked at what the Minister said.</span></p>

<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
TERMINATION OF FIRST LETTING CHARGE</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 385, in page 58, leave out lines 19 and 20.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1267">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1301</span>
We now come to the proposals relating to the termination of the first letting charge. At the risk of embarrassing my right hon. Friend, let me give a great cheer that Clause 37 is in the Bill. With the possible exception of selective employment tax, the first letting charge was the worst tax ever to have been brought before Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend agree that possibly deemed disposals under DLT are now taking over from that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I accept that. I did not include them in my remarks because they have not yet found their way on to the statute book, but no doubt there are all sorts of horrors in store for us there.<br><br>
Although I understand why the Conservative Government introduced the first letting charge, I think it was a quite mistaken concept. I am glad that it is being abolished in Clause 37, although to some extent, as my hon. Friend says, it is being replaced by the horrors of deemed disposals.<br><br>
However, the amendment wishes to take out the qualification. The amendment is what I might call an Oliver Twist amendment. Lines 19 and 20, which the amendment seeks to delete, retain the first letting charge if
<br><blockquote><p>"the relevant development relating to the chargeable building in question was begun before the appointed day."</p></blockquote>
I appreciate the difficulties which transitional arrangements in legislation have in tax. But in a tax such as first letting charge—from which, I understand, the revenue has so far been negligible, and I imagine that the assessment procedures are likely to be considerable—it would be better to make a clean break and say that from now there will be no more first letting charge and there will be an entirely different system.<br><br>
Let me refresh the Minister's memory of the parallel position with regard to betterment levy under the Land Commission Act 1967. The Labour Government introduced that levy and assessments began to work their way through the Lands Tribunal, and so on, where they were being contested. Then the Conservative Government repealed the Act and, with it, the betterment levy. But I think I am right in saying—my right hon. Friend, who knows much more about the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1302</span>
matter than I, will correct me if I am wrong—that cases of betterment levy are still grinding their way through the Lands Tribunal five years after the Act was repealed. So, in order to save the Government, the Revenue and the Civil Service a great deal of administrative time in making assessments in future on a tax which has been abolished, it would be better if the Government accepted our amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has moved an amendment seeking to do away with the first letting charge completely. Under the clause, as he appreciates, the first letting charge will be maintained in respect of commencement of material development between 17th December 1973 and the appointed day for the legislation. If there has been a commencement of material development in that period and the first letting of that development occurs after the appointed day, notwithstanding the general abolition of first letting charge, there will continue to be a charge to development gains tax in respect of that first letting, because the commencement of material development took place before the appointed day.<br><br>
The point is the same. If that charge was not preserved, the betterment value goes into the current use value for the purpose of DLT, and there will be no DLT charge unless there were some further betterment value. Without preserving the charge, there would be no charge at that point of time.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman says that first letting charge was a bad charge. I agree with him, without going into any of the political arguments. I think it is accepted as a bad charge by most people now, and we have no wish for it to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Could the Minister tell us briefly why it was a bad charge?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was a bad charge for a number of reasons. It related not to any situation which made any sense but purely to a first letting. First letting does not necessarily create any sort of betterment profit of any kind. There is no betterment at that point of time. That is why the first letting charge was thought to be bad. In fact, it has inhibited a lot of industrial development. I do not want to go into that matter, but the Industrial

Estates Association has objected vehemently to the first letting charge. I read the chairman's report the other day, in which he welcomed the Bill's doing away with the first letting charge because in his opinion it had inhibited industrial development in the way in which it operated.<br><br>
I go part of the way with the hon. Gentleman and say that I am prepared to consider whether, as from a date between 17th December 1973 and the appointed day, we might be able to bring the first letting charge to an end in the sense that if there is a commencement before that new date it continues, but if the commencement is after that new date it does not continue. I chose my words carefully—as between 17th December 1973 and the appointed day. I shall perhaps be able to introduce some concession along those lines. But, rather than commit myself to a date at the moment, I shall be grateful if the hon. Gentleman will withdraw the amendment in the light of my undertaking that I shall see whether we can choose a date somewhere in between.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister took the words out of my mouth. While I was listening to my hon. Friend moving the amendment, I thought that we could choose a date—why not 12th September 1974?—after which the first letting charge is wiped out. I have been asked over and over again since the White Paper, the blue paper, or whatever we call it was issued "Why can we not wipe out the first letting charge right away?" From a purely practical point of view, whether it is entirely fair to those who have been caught and have paid under the first letting provisions, while those who have held out and argued the point and then got let off for being difficult—it was the same problem with the betterment levy—I am glad that the Minister will consider the practical advantage of wiping them out and saying "Well, that is that. We start now on deemed disposals."<br><br>
In reading the amendment, which seeks to delete the lines which say
<br><blockquote><p>"unless the relevant development relating to the chargeable building in question was begun before the appointed day",</p></blockquote>
one then turns to subsection (2) to find out what the relevant development is. There we are referred to the 1974 Act, which I have before me. I turn to what
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1304</span>
"relevant development" is, and find one of those very choice definitions:
<br><blockquote><p>"'the relevant development', in relation to a chargeable building, means the material development from which the building has resulted or of which it has been the subject, so far as that development directly concerns that building".</p></blockquote>
Then one tries to find out what "material development" is. One plods on to paragraph 6 of Schedule 3 of that Act which says:
<br><blockquote><p>"In this Schedule, subject to the following paragraph, 'material development', in relation to any land, means the making of any change in the state, nature or use of the land".</p></blockquote>
We come back to deemed disposal, so why not come back deliberately to it in the date—the Minister has said between 1973 and the appointed day under the Bill—and wipe it out at least from that date?<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) said that after we had abolished betterment levy, the cases went on and on. Indeed, as the Minister will know, we came to the conclusion that at least the smaller cases should be forgotten. To let off those who were arguing was quite unfair on those who had already paid, but in administering that sort of tax, one reaches that stage. I think that it is morally excusable to abolish something which will cost an immense amount of administration to carry through. The Minister is right in saying that he will think about abolishing the liability after the first letting charge from some previous date.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In reply to my question why the first letting charge was a bad charge, the Minister said that there was no betterment at that point. I wish that he had listened to that reply before he drafted the Bill. The whole problem on deemed disposals is in trying to levy a tax at a time when there is no betterment. One could say that the betterment occurs either when the planning permission is given, which gives the opportunity to develop the land and make a profit from it, or when the realisation of that opportunity takes place.<br><br>
Realisation of that opportunity can take place in the form of owner-occupation, which I am glad to say we have largely exempted from the tax, in the form of sale, or in the form of letting. My own view is that if one is to choose to tax betterment when the realisation of the opportunity to carry out development has taken place,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1269">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1305</span>
one must have some charge on letting as well as sale.<br><br>
I do not go so far as my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) in his criticism of the first letting tax. If one is taxing betterment at that point, it would be quite inequitable to tax a sale but not a letting. It would open loopholes for evasion. I can imagine the kinds of letting that would be contrived to avoid the tax occurring if lettings for exempted sales were not. Undoubtedly it would be inequitable.<br><br>
The first letting tax was criticised on the ground that people were being required to pay a tax when they had realised no profit out of which to pay it. That same criticism—and it is the Ministers own criticism—can be made, but far more so, against the whole concept of deemed disposal. The more one discusses the Bill, the more one realises that it is a major criticism of the way in which the matter has been approached. I am not saying that it is easy to resolve, but I think that we are in more of a muddle about deemed disposal than ever we were about the first letting tax.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend spoke of the matter being entirely fair as between taxpayers. This is a difficult question, and I hope that when the Minister looks at his concessions, for which we are grateful, he will bear in mind the situation which I now outline. Two people—I do not suggest that they exist, but in theory they could exist—start identical developments. Let us say that each receives permission to put on one hectare of land 5,000 square metres of office space. One carries out the development and finds a tenant, lets it and becomes liable to first letting tax. The other, who has done a shoddy job, does not find a tenant until now.<br><br>
It would be extremely unfair if, merely because we were changing the system of taxation, one person got away with paying no tax while the other has to pay tax. On the face of it, the man who had done a rather better job would find himself liable to the tax while the man who had done a bad job would avoid it. This is an aspect of the situation which should be looked at.<br><br>
I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) about the <i>de minimis</i> provisions. All sorts of valuers and even land tribunals tie up a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1306</span>
great deal of their valuable time in dealing with relatively small cases, but we must ensure that no one escapes the tax in substantial cases merely because he has not succeeded in disposing of the development by a certain date.</span></p>
<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I return to the interesting idea which the Minister floated about considering a magical date somewhere between 17th December 1973 and the appointed day as a new half-way date beyond which the first letting charge would not apply.<br><br>
Since most of the arguments in the first part of the Minister's speech in favour of continuing the first letting charge at some level were identical to those he had used on material development in earlier debates concerning the hidden nature of the betterment and the fact that there would be no tax if we did not continue something, if the Minister has managed to reach a half-way point on the first letting charge is concerned, why could he not do so in previous debates? It seems to me that it is the same argument.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is the kind of difficulty one gets into in trying to meet some of the hon. Gentleman's arguments. One is taken to the logical conclusion which might not always be convenient.<br><br>
The point of first letting is that announcements were definitely made that the first letting charge would be abolished. It has been a source of grievance, and I do not wish to become involved in the argument. Bearing in mind the effect that this is supposed to have had on some industrial development—and we have had representations on this—we felt that this might do something to mitigate the situation.<br><br>
On the question of the date, I think that the right hon. Gentleman agreed with me that it could be unfair on people who had to pay the tax depending on the date chosen. On reflection, I think that we could choose today as the best date and say that if there were a commencement of material development before today and there was first letting after the appointed day, the charge should continue. However, in view of this debate, if there was commencement after today and before the appointed day, there would be no first letting charge.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1270">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1307</span>
In the circumstances, I think that that would be reasonably fair without making it too unfair for people in the past. Therefore I am prepared to move an amendment on Report to provide that in respect of any commencement as from today, the DGC charge on the first letting, if there is first letting after the appointed day, which would otherwise apply in this legislation, will not apply. I choose today as the date from which to operate the concession.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) specifically raised the definition of relevant development. My note says that since Clause 37 is aimed at continuing first letting charge—now subject to what I have said—it is right that relevant development in this context should have its 1974 meaning—namely, its meaning in the Finance Act 1974.<br><br>
That is technical, but it means the start of a building as against the site as a whole. That is the advice which I have been given. It is complicated, but we think that it is more logical to deal with the matter in that way. I hope that that proposal will go some way towards satisfying hon. Members. We cannot go all the way, but I think that that is a fair and reasonable concession. It is fair to most taxpayers in this field.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On reflection, I think that I should have declared an interest at the beginning of the discussion, because one of the companies in the group of which I am a director has a trading estate where the first lettings charge is likely to accrue. I am not a director of that company, but it occurred to me afterwards that I should have declared that interest.<br><br>
We are glad that the Minister has made a concession about the date. I wonder whether I should be miserable and suggest an earlier date. The date I had in mind was not that suggested by my right hon. Friend, but 4th February 1975, the date of publication of the Revenue statement. Paragraph 5 of that statement is self-explanatory. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The White Paper did not specifically refer to the future of the charge on the first letting of a non-residential building following material development which was introduced by Chapter II, Part III, Finance Act 1974. It has been decided that with the introduction of DLT, the charge in such circumstances will be discontinued for first lettings after the Appointed Day, except where the material development commenced before that day."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1308</span>
That announcement on 4th February 1975 could fairly be taken as a statement of the Government's intentions. That is why I urge that date rather than the White Paper date which my right hon. Friend mentioned—though only in passing. I leave that thought with the Minister, although the statement he has made this morning is greatly to be welcomed.<br><br>
So that I do not waste the time of the Committee on the "stand part" debate may I say that the objection I had to the first lettings charge was that it was a tax designed, it was thought, to deal with the situation in which property companies' asset values enormously increased every time they revalued their properties. This increased their share prices, improved their gearing and their ability to borrow. Those property companies which never disposed of their assets but held them as investment were paying only small sums in corporation tax on their trading income rather than on their actual capital value. I regard that as a nonsensical argument which reflected purely the market situation in 1972–73, a market situation which no longer applies. That is why I am glad to see the end of this tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have one comment to make on the date. My hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) is absolutely right to press for the longest possible period. I do not know whether I speak for other members of the Committee, but I was beginning to enjoy participating in his great historical events. A great sense of purpose came out of his comments. I do not know whether this feeling was shared by the Government as they joined in our deliberations. The fact that we were actually creating events was giving me a certain warmth. Although I should not want to press this point, I wondered whether my hon. Friend shared this sense of achievement.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall feel even more warm when the time comes for us to adjourn and celebrate a considerable concession. However, we are most grateful to the Minister and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>

Clause 38</div> <!-- clause -->
<section>
<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
DEDUCTION OF DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX FROM CONSIDERATION IN CASE OF CERTAIN DISPOSALS TO EXEMPT BODIES</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 344, in page 58, line 35, leave out 'subject to subsection (2) below' and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'where development land tax is payable'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to discuss the following amendments: No. 345, in page 58, line 38, leave out 'exempt'. No. 346, in page 58, leave out lines 42 to 45 and insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'the Board shall pay to that body, within three months of receipt, any development land tax so paid'.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The amendment is understandable only by taking it together with the other two to be discussed and reading the phrase right through.<br><br>
Clause 38 deals with the deduction which an exempt body can make from the purchase money, when it is acquiring property, in respect of the estimated amount of tax for which the vendor will be liable, either estimated by a specified sum from the Board of Inland Revenue or by means of a formula to which we shall come later.<br><br>
These amendments seek—I shall be quite blunt about it—to wreck this procedure, because it is a most audacious procedure of the mandarins of Middlesbrough in a sort of hole-and-corner business with the local authority or other exempt body, deciding what money shall be paid to a vendor for the purchase price of the property, and deciding that the purchaser can deduct a sum of money agreed between the Revenue and the exempt body without any notice to the vendor himself. If that is not agreed, in this hole-and-corner business between the mandarins of Middlesbrough and the officials of the local authority, a formula is applied whereby sums can be deducted without any real reference to the liability of the vendor to development land tax.<br><br>
These amendments seek to turn the whole process of Clause 38 upside down, but really the right way up. The amendments proposed would have the effect of the exempt body paying the tax in full, and the Revenue then paying the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1310</span>
amount of tax to the local authority. As I understand the clause, by the deduction of a sum in respect of the tax the local authority at once gets the benefit of that money to the detriment of the unfortunate vendor. These three amendments endeavour to say that the purchase money shall be paid in full, that, as in the normal way, the chargeable person shall be assessed to that tax, and, it having been paid to the Revenue, it will be paid over to the local authority.<br><br>
There is some argument that the local authorities should have immediate use of that money, but I can see no justification for other bodies specified as exempt bodies having that sort of privilege. Indeed, I should complain bitterly if other exempt bodies were to do so. The right way to do it is by the normal taxation method of assessing the chargeable person to the amount of tax for which he is liable and, if some other body is to have the benefit of that tax, the Revenue will pay it over in due course to that other body.<br><br>
On the other amendments there are other arguments which I wish to put forward against Clause 38 and the schedule. I think we can call it a new schedule, at least to the extent of eleven-twelfths of it. I shall have criticism on the other amendments of the whole system, but Amendment No. 344 proposes simply to remove this system altogether from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I support my right hon. Friend's amendment which, as he has said, is tremendously simple and has the effect of taking away the principle of purchase net of tax. One could leave this extensive item until the "clause stand part" debate, but it is better to point out the strong case that has been made against these proposals right at the beginning of our discussion of the clause.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
The Minister may not be surprised if I refer to the submission by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which has to operate the system. It could scarcely have spoken more forcibly against it. It says:
<br><blockquote><p>"Members of the Institution in both private and public sectors consider the proposed arrangements will give rise to marked hostility on the part of vendors, and consequent resistance to voluntary sales to the public sector."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1272">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1311</span>
It goes on to point out the consequences:
<br><blockquote><p>"We consider that it would be very much better for compensation to be paid gross, with development land tax subsequently assessed and deducted by the Inland Revenue for proportional reimbursement, with interest, to the acquiring authority."</p></blockquote>
Further on, it says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The method we have referred to above has the merit of simplicity and economy."</p></blockquote>
I am sure that the Minister has studied these points.<br><br>
We on this side of the Committee believe that it is appropriate, with the system of taxation of investment, that local authorities should have the opportunity to acquire land they require for their own purposes. I am not suggesting anything to do with the nationalisation of land that is inherent in the provisions of the Community Land Act. They should have the opportunity to acquire land for their own purposes, net of development land tax, if for no other reason than that it gives them a fair opportunity of avoiding the Revenue getting its hands on the proceeds and not sending anything back.<br><br>
Although we accept that purpose, there is no reason why the vendor should be so seriously disadvantaged that the tax procedure has to be applied so that he has his tax deducted by an inappropriate body in an inexact way, at an inappropriate time. I support the arguments of those, not only the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, who suggest that the correct way to deal with this is to have the tax assessed by the Inland Revenue, and the assessed tax then to be returned with interest, if appropriate, to the acquiring authority. That would have the merit—as the Royal Institution has said—of simplicity and economy. I hope that these are objectives that will appeal to the Minister.<br><br>
It would also have the benefit of avoiding considerable potential hostility by vendors towards selling to local authorities, and save a great deal of argument and quarrels that are likely to arise as we proceed through this clause. It would economise in the administration of the matter.<br><br>
I do not see that local acquiring authorities would be significantly disadvantaged to the extent that they might be unable to determine how much tax to deduct—they would certainly be unable to determine this. It could be said that they would be advantaged by being in due course beneficiaries of a reimbursement of the correct amount of tax. I hope that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1312</span>
the Minister will seriously examine this subsection and the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important clause giving rise to important issues of principle. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), put forward his arguments on the basis of the need for economy and simplicity in dealing with this system of assessing tax. I make my arguments on a much wider plain. There is a great need that assessing and collecting tax should be seen to be done by a body which is independent, not corrupt, and wholly independent of the political process. I base my argument mainly on the division of powers and responsibilities.<br><br>
What we have now is a system by which local authorities are the sole monopoly granters of planning permission. They control a third of the housing in this country and are about to become the monopoly land dealers. They are already substantial tax gatherers, through the rating system. It would be not merely unjust and potentially tyrannical to tell them "We allow you to assess the amount of tax that will be payable in DLT." Much worse than that, it would add another power to local authorities which would make them widely hated.<br><br>
It is vital that the amount of tax to be deducted for DLT is assessed by somebody other than the local authority. The matter should be seen immediately to be wholly outside the control of the local authority. It does not matter whether it is done by the Inland Revenue or whether another body outside the Inland Revenue is set up. The important thing is that it should be seen from the very start that the local authority has no part whatever in assessing its own tax.<br><br>
Already we are seeing local authorities muddle up their housing powers and duties to provide schools with their planning powers. We do not want a feeling that they are also muddling up their taxing powers and using them for political purposes. It is not just a matter of dealing with this on a narrow political basis. Local authorities are great arm of government, and all of us believe in local government. We believe in diffusing power away from this place to locally-elected people. But it will be very dangerous if we put them in such an all-powerful position and focus upon local authorities so much hatred and suspicion as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1273">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1313</span>
there are likely to be if the Minister persists with this arrangement.<br><br>
There must be some element of independence in the system. Whether it is done through the Inland Revenue, which is still widely trusted, or through some other body, we cannot have the situation in which not only is it believed that the local authority is acting in a political way in acquiring land and disposing of land, but there is the suspicion that it may be acting in a political way in assessing the amount of tax.<br><br>
The amount of tax, however it is laid down, no matter how complicated and exact the particular schedule may be, is bound to be a matter of judgment. It must be based upon matters of judgment as to valuation. It cannot be on any other basis, and there will always be room for honest disagreement. If initially the unhappy landowner must accept the valuation put on the land by the district valuer there will be a grave sense of injustice among all landowners, and it will spread.<br><br>
On the Government side of the Committee, there has always been the feeling that all landowners are splendid people who are always advised by the best members of the tax Bar. It is not always so. The Minister should remember that the whole concept of the last attempt at the nationalisation of land was brought down not by the attacks of the big landowners on the idea of a State monopoly in development land but as a result of the way in which small people with small areas of land were caught. It was seen that the State monster was walking all over little people wanting to sell their orchards. The same sort of mistakes will occur unless the Minister quickly builds some form of independent assessment into this system of deciding how much tax shall be deducted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The more I look at the implications of Clause 38 and Schedule 7, particularly in the light of the substantial amendment to Schedule 7 tabled by the Minister, which effectively replaces what was already in the Bill and goes into a lot of detail which we shall be discussing, the more concerned I am about how this will operate in practice. I warmly support my right hon. and hon. Friends in their view, that this is the wrong way to deal with taxation aspects of transactions in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1314</span>
land where the purchaser is a local authority and much more so when the purchaser is not a local authority but an exempt body.<br><br>
But let us consider the local council or county council which will be involved in such cases. In considering Clause 38, we should take into account the letter from the Secretary of the Association of County Councils dated 28th April to all members of the Committee. No doubt all hon. Members will have been in touch with their local councils and found, for the most part, that they are exceedingly anxious about the way this will operate.<br><br>
The Secretary of the Association of County Councils, Mr. Hetherington, said that last September the Association had discussions with the Minister for Planning and Local Government. What a pity it did not also have discussions with the Treasury. This is a tax matter, and the Treasury may have produced a more sensible answer than the Minister for Planning and Local Government. The point the Association made then, as it made to all members of the Committee, was that it did not feel the councils should be put in the position of being tax collectors. It is not their function, as my hon. Friend, the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) stressed, and they do not want to assume that function. They believe it will strengthen vendor resistance, that it will lead to widespread misunderstanding of the motives of local authorities, that it will generate hostility to other aspects of the community land scheme, to the operation of the development land tax and to the acquisition of land by authorities. The Association stresses that most strongly. It feels that the two criteria of most interest to local authorities are certainty and the avoidance of vendor resistance. Certainty consists of advance knowledge of the effective cost of land acquisition to the acquiring authority. It has been claimed as one of the advantages of the Government's approach, but it could only be so if most cases were likely to be dealt with by authorities on a tax-liability basis.<br><br>
We shall discuss the implications of Schedule 7 at a later stage. These remarks were made before the Government amendment was tabled. Nevertheless, the authorities are likely to find that in many cases substantial adjustments will be required. They are profoundly anxious on this point. They are not seduced by the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1274">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1315</span>
Government's argument that, by paying net of development land tax, their cash flow problems will be greatly eased. They feel that in many cases the deduction will have to be, for reasons of safety, much less than the tax eventually due and that the local authority will pay interest on the amount of tax deducted from the date it is deducted until the date the tax would otherwise be payable.<br><br>
It has also been suggested to the Association that the tax would reduce the total amount required for loan sanctions, which would go some way to meeting Treasury concern about the cost of the Act. But the Association points out that, if the Inland Revenue could assess, collect and remit the tax within a reasonable time:
<br><blockquote><p>"it would only be necessary for the local authority to have a net loan sanction since there would be a capital receipt to set against the gross cost."</p></blockquote>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
These points are made very strongly by the local authorities, and they remind us of debates we had earlier in Committee, that local authorities were likely, because of the advantage in price to them, to go for the green field sites rather than infilling sites within the towns. If they are seen to be making low price purchases, because of the deduction of substantial amounts of tax, it will increase public suspicion. I fear that that is the inevitable consequence. It is not wished for by the local authorities. The Committee should bear in mind that to enact tax legislation of this kind, which puts the councils in an invidious position in relation to people living in their area, whose lives they affect in many other ways, would be irresponsible. Therefore, I warmly support my right hon. and hon. Friends on these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Government tabled Amendment No. 406, which we are not discussing at the moment, although it is germane to our discussion, it was easy to argue that Clause 38 was probably the worst drafted clause in the Bill, and certainly had the worst content. In its previous form, there was no provision for ensuring that authorities did not make arbitrary deductions. There was no provision for a proper appeals machinery nor for prompt repayment of over-deduction. Amendment No. 406, which we will come to in due course, goes some way toward meeting some of those points, particularly that of arbitrary deduction, by the formula
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1316</span>
spelt out, where under-assessment is likely to occur.<br><br>
However, we return again and again to the basic question: what is in the general interest of the citizen? I agree, for the most part with my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) in the powerful speech he made.<br><br>
I attach considerable importance to one matter raised in the letter from the Association of County Councils which my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) did not mention; that is, the question of tax confidentiality. It is wholly unsatisfactory that a new spanner should be put in the works in dealings between the taxpayer and the Revenue—that is to say, the local authority, as the local authority will be involved, directly or indirectly, in the subsequent calculations. The local authority makes deductions in accordance with the formula or—on the 110 per cent. basis if they think there is no need to use the formula—makes its deductions and subsequently tax is either repaid or reclaimed from the taxpayer.<br><br>
It might be theoretically possible to argue that the local authority was not involved in that; that that would subsequently be a matter between the Revenue and the taxpayer. But, in reality we know that the local authority is likely to be involved because the Revenue will have continually to write to it asking whether it paid money to the vendor, how much it was, on what date it took place and what assumptions were used. All sorts of calculations will have to be made, and the Revenue will want to know them to ensure that the tax was properly assessed. If it has not been properly assessed under the formula method, they have to enter into more correspondence.<br><br>
Obviously the local authority will be substantially involved in the dealings between the Revenue and the taxpayer, which is an undesirable and unsatisfactory position, likely to weaken severely the confidentiality of a tax system which Parliament has always been very careful to defend. Indeed, the inspector and the collector have always been different people to avoid unnecessary or unreasonable hardship to the taxpayer or disclosure of vital information.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend's amendments propose a much neater solution. We are obviously in some difficulty because so many amendments deal with basically the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1275">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1317</span>
same point. Indeed, Government Amendment No. 406 is a substantial one which we shall discuss in a moment.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend's proposal is really very simple. The local authority is entitled, if Parliament so decides, to be relieved of the effects of the tax. We are not disputing that. But, he rightly says in his amendment, there is no reason why the method of doing that should be for the local authority itself to deduct the tax. Let it pay the full amount to the taxpayer and then let the tax collector—in other words, the Government—pay to the local authority that amount which it believes the local authority should be relieved of. That seems to me to be an entirely proper and desirable way to proceed. The local authority will get the benefit of the subvention which the Treasury will give by in effect getting net of development land tax, but the dealings will be solely between the taxpayer and the Revenue at individual level. That also seems to me to be the right way to go about it.<br><br>
To my mind, the most significant thing to come out of the whole of this debate is that the Association of County Councils does not want this procedure either. If it is worried about this, and if it does not like the idea of having to act as tax collectors for the Government, I really think that the Government should think about this again. After all, the whole purpose of Clause 38 as at present drafted is to advantage local government. It does not advantage the taxpayer in any way at all. It is to advantage local government. If one of the main local government associations is itself diametrically opposed to it, I believe that the Government should think again.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an important amendment and an important debate. The other debates which we shall have on the new paragraph to the schedule and on the schedule will also be important debates, because we are here concerned with fundamental matters. I accept that entirely.<br><br>
I agree entirely with the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen). He said that tax matters and the assessment of tax should be wholly out of the control of local authorities. That, of course, is what we have provided. This is wholly out of the control of local
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1318</span>
authorities. There is no question at all of the local authority being the assessing authority for tax. The local authority is merely the collecting agent. It has to collect the tax in accordance either with an assessment which may have been raised by the Revenue already, which would be unlikely in most cases, or a provisional assessment—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah!</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says "Ah!" He should wait—or a provisional assessment agreed between the Inland Revenue and the vendor. That is another situation which could arise. The vendor could very well say to the Inland Revenue in Middlesbrough "This is the situation I am faced with. This is what I am going to be paid for this land. Could we agree a provisional assessment?" It may very well be possible to do that and it may be in the vendor's interest to do that at that point in time. Then, having received a provisional assessment from the Inland Revenue, he can go to the local authority and ask the local authority if it will agree to a deduction in accordance with that provisional assessment. That could happen.<br><br>
Then there is a third situation. If there is no agreement on that kind of assessment, there is a strict formula in the legislation giving the local authority no discretion in relation to the amount of tax that is to be deducted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In fairness to my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), would not the Minister agree that the ACC itself says at the top of page 2 of its brief that it is likely to be the usual case that no instructions will be received from the Revenue as to what amount is to be deducted and therefore the local authorities will have to deduct in accordance with the formula? In those circumstances, of course, they are involved in individual assessments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I said that in many cases, and perhaps in most cases, it would not be possible even to receive a provisional assessment from the Inland Revenue. If that is the situation, there is a formula laid down in the legislation. It is a strict formula. Tax is to be deducted according to that formula. The tax charge does not depend on the taxpayer's other income.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1276">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1319</span>
It has nothing to do with his other income. This covers the point about confidentiality. It is simply a charge of 80 per cent.—or 66ࡪ per cent. for three years—on the actual sum of money itself, the purchase consideration. There is no question of giving the local authorities any discretion in relation to the tax that is to be paid.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: However we amend or change the strict formula, as the Minister puts it, the strict formula at some stages will have to be based upon a value judgment. It cannot be based on anything else. It is all very well to say that there is no discretion in the local authority. Of course, there is no discretion as to the application of the formula. The formula will have to be applied. But in the course of applying the formula judgments will have to be made. So at any rate in the initial stages my proposition that the local authority would be assessing the tax is true. I know that the Minister has tried to bring in the independent element at a later stage. That is the whole effect of what he is trying to do with Amendment No. 406, and we respect what he is trying to do. But there is still the point that at least initially the local authority will be assessing the tax.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not assessing the tax. The only question is the question of valuation, the question of current use value. I accept that entirely. That valuation has to be arrived at. But that has to be arrived at for all sorts of circumstances. Indeed, in relation to the sale and the negotiation between the local authority and the vendor, the question of current use value will invariably enter into that. But leaving that aside, which is not really an assessing matter at all, the formula is a strict formula and the deduction is absolutely strict. There is no question about tax confidentiality or anything else, because this tax is not based on the taxpayer's other income. The local authority would know everything, anyway, even if it did not have to deduct the tax. It would know exactly what money it would be paying to the vendor. It would know the development value of the land on that basis. It does not know anything more in relation to the taxpayer than it would have known if it was not acting as collecting agent. That disposes of the point about tax confidentiality.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1320</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The argument I was putting forward was not just based upon tax confidentiality, although my hon. Friend's argument was based on that. My argument was based on the wider issue that the local authority ought not to be assessing tax at any point because it was a beneficiary from its own assessment. As the Minister fairly says, initially a value judgment has to be made about the current use value. That is where the danger arises. We can change and fiddle the formula and all the rest, but a judgment will still have to be made about the current use value. That is being done by the local authority, which is the beneficiary of the assessment which it itself makes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman should not use the word "assessment" as it is a technical word. The local authority is not assessing anybody to tax. It is collecting tax in accordance with a formula. He says that there may be a dispute about current use value. I accept that entirely. If there is a dispute about current use value and the vendor and the local authority cannot agree on that figure, the vendor can put his figure to the Inland Revenue which can then agree with the vendor a figure of current use value to be determined for the purposes of a provisional assessment and a provisional deduction. The local authority will then have to deduct the amount of tax as provided in that provisional assessment. So if the vendor does not like the local authority's figure he can go direct to the Revenue and say "My figure is such and such". The Revenue may then agree a figure with him. The Revenue and the vendor can decide their own provisional assessment and the local authority will then have to deduct the tax on the basis of what the Inland Revenue agrees with the vendor. But if there is agreement between the vendor and the local authority on the current use value the formula deduction applies.<br><br>
The vendor therefore has the choice. He has the choice either of going to the Revenue and deciding it or of going to the local authority. Obviously, if he cannot agree with the local authority he will go to the Revenue. If he can agree with the local authority, the problem does not arise.<br><br>
I therefore come back to the point that there is no question here of assessment of tax. It is purely a question of collection
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1277">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1321</span>
machinery. There is no question of this affecting the confidentiality of any taxpayer whatsoever. Indeed, if we talk about the confidentiality of the taxpayer, an employer's duty and obligation to deduct tax under PAYE goes much further than any confidentiality aspect that could arise in this case. Indeed, most people's taxes are paid through deduction by their employers under the PAYE system. There is no confidentiality question here.<br><br>
The Association of County Councils has raised some objections, but it is only one of five associations which have made representations to the Inland Revenue on these matters. There is not a unanimity of view between them. Some dislike it, some quite like it, and in between there are others which are not sure. I shall not pretend to the Committee that the new arrangement has received universal acclamation, but on the other hand many local authorities like it because they get their money to do what they want to do. The hon. Gentleman says "Why not go to the Treasury?", but then we should have borrowing requirements and all sorts of problems. Many local authorities want the money and want it as quickly as possible, and they do not oppose the scheme for that reason.<br><br>
12.30 p.m.<br><br>
I accept as a genuine fear that some have been afraid of being seen to be tax gatherers and that there will be some hostility against them for that reason. We have, however, attempted—and I think that most of them have now agreed—to lay down a formula in the Bill which will ensure that that will not be the case, and that if there is to be opprobrium it will fall where it should fall—upon the Board of Inland Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talks of the fear of local authorities of suffering the opprobrium of the rôle of tax gatherers. What we are really concerned about is that cases will occur, perhaps through misunderstanding, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) mentioned, where someone has paid too much tax and seriously suffered because of it. This can be avoided only by adopting the procedure proposed in the amendment. There is no other way of ensuring that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1322</span>
we eliminate that risk. It is a risk about which we should all be concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point. Hon. Members opposite are concerned—and I am glad to see it—about local authorities in this matter. They are concerned that they should be able to buy land easily and that our rules should not inhibit them from purchasing land. This shows a consensus in the Committee which I did not think always existed. We are grateful for this solicitude on behalf of local authorities, and the desire to see that they can buy as much land as possible without difficulties or hostility.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) said that there might be hostility if there were over-deduction. I do not think that there will be over-deduction in most cases, because the formula, and the 50 per cent. ceiling, provide that, if anything, there will be under-deduction. There may be some cases. We have tried to provide for interest payments to run from certain dates, to ensure that people are not disadvantaged as a result of this procedure. The interest provisions are fairly complicated. I do not know whether I should deal with them here or later. Perhaps it would be better if I dealt with them later, but I would make the point now that we have tried to frame the interest provisions so that vendors will not be inconvenienced or feel a sense of injustice because too much tax may have been paid. Also, we are conscious that local authorities may not be able to buy so much land, for if land is sold to a private buyer the net of tax arrangements will not apply, and to insure against such a situation we have provided for interest to run for the benefit of a person selling to a local authority, because he will suffer a tax deduction procedure perhaps earlier than it would be assessed in respect of a sale between private persons. The interest provisions, therefore, will try to resolve that problem.<br><br>
Again, I want to say clearly that there is no question here of trying to enforce any taxing obligation upon local authorities. The deduction formula is clearly laid down. The vendor can always go to the Revenue and have the matter decided there, perhaps upon a provisional basis, which is the more likely, and then go to the local authority and say "This is what the Revenue says. Now you deduct
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1278">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1323</span>
according to what I and the Revenue have agreed." That may take a little longer and perhaps some local authorities will not like such a delay, but it is right and fair to have that provision so that, if the vendor does not want to rely on the local authority's estimate of current use value, he can go to the Revenue and decide it between himself and the Revenue, and the early deduction procedures will then apply.<br><br>
This is a novel procedure, but we think if fair and right. It enables local authorities to get the money they want as quickly as possible, and it does not disadvantage the vendor, because we have provided the fallback at the end of the day, that one can have it decided by the Inland Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have listened carefully to the Minister. We know perfectly well that the mechanism that he has endeavoured to build into this tax is one which fully takes account of our justifiable fears. There is no doubt that when local authorities are dealing with powerful people who have strong interests there is no risk whatever that those people will be walked over by the local authorities.<br><br>
However, the fact is that dealing with land, and with the assessment of tax in relation to land, is very expensive. There has been a great deal of legislation recently, and the result is that those who can even pretend to have a working knowledge of this vast mass of legislation make up a small and elite body—and small and elite bodies are perfectly entitled to charge a great deal for their services.<br><br>
The result of these proposals will be this. The Duke of Westminster's family estates, for instance, will get a very good deal, because they will be able to work very hard when they deal with the local authority which wants to acquire the land, and which will make assessments based on the most favourable judgment of the current use value.<br><br>
When little Mrs. Smith in Grazely in my constituency finds that half an acre of her land is to be taken by the local authority, she will say to herself, "Why incur another £100 worth of professional advice?" It may even be more than that, possibly £500 worth of professional advice—"Why should I try to fight the local authority about the amount of tax which is to be deducted. Let me accept what it says". So she accepts.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1324</span>
It will not be until four or five years later that she finds the authority has deducted, say, an extra £1,000 or £2,000, and the real value of that £1,000 or £2,000 has, perhaps, halved in value. No amount of interest which is given to her will have any real effect because she will pay tax on that interest at a much higher rate than on the capital value which she ought to have retained. Once again we shall see the smaller members of our society being walked over.<br><br>
The Minister has made a substantial concession to the Opposition's point of view. I am not suggesting that his instincts are in any way authoritarian, but we are dealing with that tiny section of the community which gets caught in the crucifying effects of this sort of legislation. The only fair way is to build in an independent system, as was suggested by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), right from the beginning.<br><br>
It is no good saying "It is built in nearly from the beginning." I agree that it is built in nearly from the beginning, and it is fair to say that the Minister, in his ingenious method of dealing with this, has probably obliterated 99 per cent. of the injustices that might occur. We are dealing with only 1 per cent., but that 1 per cent. might be an injustice which will change the life of one of our fellow citizens. We are dealing with a piece of land which is to provide for security in old age of some old pensioner who has probably already invested all her savings in War Savings, as she sees it, as a great gesture of patriotic fervour and has been "conned" by successive Governments, and by inflation, of all her savings.<br><br>
At least we can try to recognise what is happening and build in an independent system from the start. It is not good enough to leave this small area. It might be only for a short period, and something which most people will be able to avoid, but we owe it to ordinary people to try to build in this system of independence right from the start.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is quite right to refer to the risk inherent in the 1 per cent. of the cases which are not covered. In his remarks, the Minister recognised, I think, that in the majority of cases one would have to use the formula. He referred to the possibility of a provisional assessment, but the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1279">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1325</span>
difficulty of getting a provisional assessment is that one must have an agreement about value. We come back to our friends the district valuers, and their not inconsiderable workload and how many years they are behind in many aspects of it. Therefore, in most cases we will find that it is not possible, even if one wished to achieve it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In many of these cases—in my experience—the district valuer would have been brought in, anyway, near the beginning in any acquisitions by a local authority which would not agree a purchase price for land, I should have thought, unless in some way it consulted the district valuer. This would not be so in every case, but in many.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the district valuer will be involved, but this does not mean that the district valuer's figure will have been agreed by the vendor. Indeed, the problem is that there is often a long argument between the vendor's agents and the district valuer. I do not know whether the Minister is aware of a case that arose in my constituency where, I think, it ended up with the aggrieved individual standing as an independent candidate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will recognise that, at present, the local athorities have no obligation to go to district valuers in order to get even loan sanction to make the purchases. They can use their own valuers, so there is no surety that the district valuers will advise them.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend, and I agree that it is another risk. A local authority would not have to go to the district valuer, but could rely on its own valuer to do it, and therefore the possibility of getting through this provisional assessment is quite ruled out. So we have the situation where, in the Minister's own words, the majority of cases will be decided on the formula. Surely where the difficulty is likely to arise is when we have a case A base value. Where we have improvements and where we have an acquisition cost, will not these be the ones where there will be the greatest difficulty? There might be a high acquisition cost. There might be large sums of money spent on improvement. How will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1326</span>
the local authorities know about these? These are not taken into account in the formula. Is not that where the one per cent. will arise? I fear it may be more than one per cent. Bad law making in bad cases will arise and it will cause a great deal of unnecessary friction—between the local authority which did not wish to get involved in this aspect of the Bill, and individuals. It can lead to quite disastrous publicity, and one envisages one of those unfortunate incidents in the past which have occurred in this sort of legislation. I should have thought that the Minister would have been well advised to reconsider the whole approach here and perhaps come back at a later stage with a formula to remove this grave risk from the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), said this would probably cover only a small area where difficulties would arise. I think we have to recognise that this Bill is put forward on the basis that, at some time, the second appointed day under the Community Land Act will arise when all property will be sold to the local authority. There will be no sales between individuals. We shall be faced with compulsory purchase, or purchase by agreement with bodies that have compulsory powers, and this will apply all the time. There will be a complete deduction of the development value.<br><br>
The Minister said that this was not taxation by local authorities and that it was merely collection of a sum of money settled by the Inland Revenue or by some formula in the Bill. I do not think he can possibly continue to argue on that basis. This is an occasion when he has jumped the gun on Layfield. We do not know what Layfield will recommend about local authorities collecting their own tax, whether by continuing with the rating system or by a method of income tax. But here, quite definitely, the local authorities are given the power by being able to decide themselves what the current use value of the property is, and the amount of tax which they can put in their own pockets by these methods.<br><br>
There may be some argument for local authorities having this exceptional right of taxation, but why on earth should we give that right to the other bodies mentioned in Clause 11? As for the confidentiality and impartiality of local authorities when
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1280">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1327</span>
they come to deal with it, I might have trusted the county councils, I might even have trusted the district councils, but I would not trust the parish councils, and they are given the power. Small local councils will have compulsory purchase power under Clause 11(1)(<i>e</i>). Then I think of the national bodies mentioned in Clause 11(2)—because if they have compulsory purchase powers to acquire the property which is the subject of the transaction, they too can make the deductions.<br><br>
This is not, therefore, merely a local tax, which the Minister calls collection of tax. I think that it is, by the power of the authority to settle current use value, far more than that. It is—my hon. Friends have used the word—assessment of the amount to be paid. Even under the formula, the local authority has discretion in settling the current use value. There may be an argument for local authorities having that power, but there can be no argument for a nationalised body having its own right of taxation of the public, and that is what we are saying here. The Welsh Development Agency, by settling the current use value, can settle the formula, and therefore it is assessing tax and collecting itself. Are we to breach the whole principle of taxation in this Bill? It is not merely collection.<br><br>
The Minister said that it is in the hands of the vendor himself to question the assessment of current use value by the authority. Is he prepared, then, to say that no local authority, or the Scottish Development Agency, or any of the others mentioned in Clause 11—or, indeed, at the risk of offending my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart), the Letchworth Garden City Corporation, which will have the right to assess the current use value and decide the formula—shall have the right of entry before it has made payment, even of the net purchase money? What will happen here is that if the vendor decides to take his case to the Inland Revenue, the local authority or other body will serve a notice of entry and will have the vendor out of that property, enter on it itself, and say "Now we shall argue for three years with the Inland Revenue, and take it to appeal on the amount of current use value." The vendor will not dare to take it to the Inland Revenue—I would not, if I were a vendor—with a notice of entry hanging over his head.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1328</span>
If, then, he argues that it is all in the hands of the vendor, he must prevent the exempt body from having any right to serve a notice of entry and entering upon the property until it has paid the full purchase money, or at least a substantial amount of it.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) pointed out that the body of those professional men who will be concerned with this matter, surveyors both in the private and public sectors, dislike this procedure. I am pleased to learn that those surveyors in the public sector see the difficulties inherent in this sort of collection of tax.<br><br>
I agree with the Minister that there is not a unanimity of view among local authorities. The Association of County Councils puts a very strong case, which is in line with the amendments we are now debating. It does not want to collect the tax direct. It does not want the job of assessing the amount. Perhaps the procedure has altered now the Minister has put down his new paragraphs for the schedule, but there is still that discretion in the purchasing body to fix the eventual amount of the formula. That is what the Association of County Councils objected to.<br><br>
The interest payments mentioned by the Minister do not compensate for that. Frequently, when property is being compulsorily acquired by a local authority, or by one of the nationalised bodies, the vendor is desperately anxious to obtain property in which to move. If a business is being sold, or business land, the vendor has to find other property. Interest payments will not satisfy him on that. He wants the money in his hand. He wants to know how much it will be, but he will know that only by giving way entirely to the views of the purchasing body.<br><br>
The vendor can have no reliance on the fact that there is an independent valuer—the district valuer—because in many cases these bodies do not have to go to the district valuer. Certainly local authorities do not, but I am not sure of the position of the other nationalised bodies. I assume that they are free to use their own valuers. I do not believe that the Commission for New Towns has to go to the district valuer before it purchases. What is the position of the Lea Valley Regional Park Authority? What assurance do we have that such bodies will not act for their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1281">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1329</span>
own benefit in deciding the basis of the formula?<br><br>
The speed with which the notices are given to the Inland Revenue and the speed at which the process is undertaken of deciding what they think is the current use value is also entirely in the hands of these bodies. During that time the poor unfortunate vendor is left in a state of indecision about the time of completion, indecision about whether he will be left in possession of the property himself, and indecision as to the amount he will eventually receive. The whole process, as my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) said, is entirely for the benefit of the local authority or nationalised body mentioned in Clause 11.<br><br>
There is little consideration from the practical point of view for the vendor and what he will receive for being deprived of his property. I do not think that we should breach all the principles of taxation, and many of the principles of compulsory purchase of property, by this new idea of deduction from the purchase money.<br><br>
I am also puzzled about another matter. In the Community Land Act, the local authorities comprising the counties and the districts are obliged to prepare what, in the course of discussions on the Bill we came to call the LAMS—the land acquisition and management schemes. I understood that under those schemes it would be decided what local authorities within a county should purchase and how it would be done in co-operation. Does not that mean that those bodies would have to have some joint account of the tax which obtained from these transactions? What is the point of these land acquisition and management schemes if one of the local authorities within a scheme is to pocket the tax? Surely the whole point of the schemes was that within an area they should manage not only the land but the tax to be obtained and put it to the advantage of all the authorities within that scheme.<br><br>
It seems to me that the procedure falls down right away on that basis. What
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 1330</span>
ought to be looked at is to whom this tax should be paid, not who should deduct it and, as it were, pinch it on the way.<br><br>
I suppose it is too much wishful thinking on my part for the Minister to accept amendments, which I said were amendments wrecking the scheme and trying to get come sense into this part of the Bill. I cannot expect him to accept them in full, but will he try to appreciate the impact of these upon the ordinary person faced with the sale of his property, whether by agreement or by compulsion, to one of these exempt bodies?<br><br>
Do not let us cover up the difficulty by saying that we are giving local authorities the right to have their money quickly so that it does not get into the hands of the Exchequer and they have to wait for it to be paid out. This involves not just local authorities but all the other bodies mentioned in Clause 11. If we are to give these several nationalised bodies the right to collect tax direct from the citizen, we are proposing a complete breach of taxation principles.<br><br>
From the practical side, it will be quite impossible for the vendor to have any control over this procedure. He faces the prospect of entering into an agreement for the sale of his property to one of these bodies under the threat of compulsory purchase powers. Is he to be able to say in that agreement—if he is to sell by agreement because he is threatened with compulsory purchase—how much that body shall deduct by way of tax, so that at that stage he will know what purchase money he will receive? I cannot imagine that, with the powers given to these bodies under the Bill, they will agree to putting that into the agreement, thus there will be further delay. If he then refuses to enter into the agreement and the compulsory purchase order is used—</span></p>
