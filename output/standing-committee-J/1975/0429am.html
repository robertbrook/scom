<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this amendment we are discussing the following:</span></p>
<div class='procedure'><span class='label label-warning'>procedure</span>

<p>Amendment No. 84, in page 15, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>h</i>) the trustees of an approved pension fund being a fund established by a retirement pension scheme approved under section 22 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970, a superannuation scheme approved under section 208 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 or retirement pension scheme approved under Part II of Chapter II of the Finance Act 1970'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Amendment No. 85, in page 15, line 41, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>h</i>) a superannuation fund approved under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 and under the Finance Act 1970'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>New Clause 1—<i>Pensions funds: interests in land held on 12th September 1974—</i>
<br><blockquote><p>'(1) Development land tax shall not be chargeable on any realised development value accruing to a pension fund on the disposal of an interest in land which—
<ol>
<li>was held by the pension fund on 12th September 1974; or</li>
<li>was held by another pension fund on that date and has at no time between that date and the time of the disposal been held otherwise than by a pension fund; or</li>
<li>is the retained interest or the granted interest in relation to a previous disposal of an interest in land which, immediately before that disposal, fell within paragraph (<i>a</i>) or paragraph (<i>b</i>) above or this paragraph and which has at no time between the time of its acquisition and the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 728</span>
time at which it is disposed of been held otherwise than by a pension fund;</li></ol>
and for the purposes of this section an interest in land shall be treated as held by a pension fund on 12th September 1974 if, under the will of a person who died before that date, the pension fund would on that date have been absolutely entitled to that interest if the administration of the deceased's estate had been completed.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2)Subject to subsection (3) below, in any case where—
<ol>
<li>on 12th September 1974 a lease was held by a pension fund, and</li>
<li>subsequent to that date, but without its ever having been held otherwise than by a pension fund, the lease became merged in another interest (in this subsection and subsection (3) below referred to as "the greater interest"), and</li>
<li>after the merger the greater interest was acquired by another pension fund, without its ever having been held otherwise than by a pension fund,</li></ol>
paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 to this Act shall have effect on a disposal of the greater interest by a pension fund which acquired it as mentioned in paragraph (<i>c</i>) above as if, immediately before the acquisition of the greater interest by the pension fund—
<ol>
<li>the lease continued to exist as a separate entity, and</li>
<li>the pension fund acquired the lease for an appropriate proportion of the consideration given by it for the acquisition of the greater interest,</li></ol>
so that the lease constitutes a part of the relevant interest for the purposes of the said paragraph 8.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3)Subsection (2) above shall cease to apply in relation to a lease at such time as the lease would have come to an end, had it not become merged in another interest, and, for the purposes of that subsection, references (other than in paragraph (<i>b</i>) thereof) to the greater interest include references to an interest in land of which, on a disposal thereof by a pension fund, the greater interest was a part for the purposes of Part I of Schedule 2 to this Act.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(4)In any case where—
<ol>
<li>on 12th September 1974 a pension fund held an option falling within section 8(1) above, and</li>
<li>the option was subsequently exercised, without it ever having been held otherwise than by a pension fund, and</li>
<li>the interest acquired by virtue of the exercise of the option (in this subsection and subsection (5) below referred to as "the substantive interest") was subsequently acquired by another pension fund, without its ever having been held otherwise than by a pension fund,</li></ol>
paragraph 8 of Schedule 2 to this Act shall have effect on a disposal of the substantive interest by a pension fund which acquired it as mentioned in paragraph (<i>c</i>) above as if—
<ol>
<li>the option had not been exercised at the time of that acquisition and the pension fund had acquired the option instead of the substantive interest, and</li>
<li>immediately after its acquisition of the option the pension fund had acquired the substantive interest in exercise of the option,</li></ol>

so that the option constitutes a part of the relevant interest for the purposes of the said paragraph 8.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>References in subsection (4) above to the substantive interest include references to an interest in land of which, on a disposal thereof by a pension fund, the substantive interest was a part for the purposes of Part I of Schedule 2 to this Act.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>If an interest in land which falls within any of paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>c</i>) of subsection (1) above ceases at any time, otherwise than on the occasion of a disposal, to be held for the purposes of a pension fund—
<ol>
<li>the interest shall be treated for the purposes of this Act (other than this subsection) as having been disposed of at that time for a consideration equal to its market value and as having been immediately reacquired at that value; and</li>
<li>any realised development value which accrues on the disposal referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>) above shall be treated as not having accrued to a pension fund.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(7)If, at any time after the disposal of an interest in land falling within any of paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>c</i>) of subsection (1) above, the body which made the disposal ceases to be a pension fund, then, immediately after it so ceases, an amount of realised development value equal to that in respect of which the exemption in subsection (1) above applied on the disposal shall be treated for the purposes of this Act as accruing to that body, as on the disposal of an interest in land.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(8)Notwithstanding anything in section 44(2)(<i>a</i>) below, an interest in land acquired by a pension fund under a conditional contract entered into on or before 12th September 1974 shall be treated for the purposes of this section as held by the pension fund on that date.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(9)References in this Act to a pension fund are references to such a fund as is established by a retirement pension scheme approved under section 22 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 or Part II of Chapter II of the Finance Act 1970 or a superannuation scheme approved under section 208 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970'.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>New Clause 3—<i>Exemption for approved pension funds—</i>
<br><blockquote><p>'(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, development land tax shall not be chargeable on any realised development accruing to a pension fund on the disposal of an interest in land.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>If an interest in land held for the purposes of a pension fund ceases to be held for such purposes—
<ol>
<li>the trustees of the fund shall be treated as if they had disposed of, and immediately re-acquired, that interest for a consideration equal to its market value, any realised development value on the disposal being treated as not accruing to the pension fund, and</li>
<li>if and so far as that interest represents, directly or indirectly the consideration for the disposal of assets by the trustees, any realised development value on that disposal shall be treated as not having accrued to a pension fund
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 730</span>
and any assessment to development land tax by virtue of paragraph (<i>b</i>) above may be made at any time not more than three years after the end of the year of assessment in which the said interest ceases to be held for the purposes of a pension fund.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(3)References in this Act to a pension fund are references to such a fund as is established by a retirement pension scheme approved under section 22 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 or Part II of Chapter II of the Finance Act 1970 or a superannuation scheme approved under section 208 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long and interesting debate on these amendments. I do not want to pursue the arguments again. There is a gulf between us. I shall not be able to convince hon. Gentlemen, and they will not be able to convince me. However, I do not want to be discourteous to the Committee and make it appear that I am not keen to try to reply—if that is the right word—or reiterate one or two points that I made, although I appreciate that most hon. Members would prefer to draw the debate on these amendments to a conclusion.<br><br>
This is an extremely important subject. That is why I thought I should go on at some length. It has aroused considerable controversy. We are debating from the general principle, subject to the trading point, of taxing pension funds. But we are doing so, we believe, for good reasons and not because we feel vindictive towards pension funds. Many of my own constituents benefit from being members of pension funds, as do many constituents of my hon. Friends.<br><br>
In this case we feel that this is the right way to deal with the matter, balancing one against the other, given the basis of the legislation—which is to try to restore to the community. I accept entirely that words like "community" are sometimes rather imprecise. The community do not always get back what it should get back, because we have to act through democratic institutions.<br><br>
The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) said that pension funds benefit the community as well. I suppose they do. But there is no such thing as one pension fund covering the whole country. What we have are a number of pension funds of different organisations. One pension fund may be far-sighted and buy some land at development value, and another pension fund may not. The one pension fund gets the benefit and the other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0962">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 731</span>
does not. Therefore, one cannot equate pension funds with some of the bodies mentioned in this legislation whose objective it is to benefit the community, albeit the local community within the jurisdiction of the local authority, the Highlands and Islands Development Board community, or the Scottish Development Agency community. The pension fund is different. Because if is different, within the scheme of this legislation, it would not be right to grant this exemption.<br><br>
The other point raised concerned charities. I do not want to go into the debate on charities, because we have some other amendments on which will discuss charities in more detail. Charities are also dealt with in a later clause in the Bill, where there are specific exemptions for charities, although hon. Gentlemen have said, and doubtless will continue to say, that those exemptions do not go far enough.<br><br>
However, I should like to try again to explain why I cannot go along with the amendment which seeks to give the same exemption to pension funds as we have given in the Bill for charities. The point has been made, and it is a reasonable one, that charities and pension funds often are not very different. That is perfectly true. Often they are not very different. There is no difference at all between the Church of England pension fund investing in property and the ICI pension fund investing in property.<br><br>
But that is not the only sphere of operation of a charity. Of course some charities operate in that sphere. When we come to the amendment on charities, I shall endeavour to refrain from using the phrase "churches and charities". I know that it is used in some legislation, but so far as I am aware it is not normally used in fiscal legislation. Hon. Members may say that that does not matter, that the phrase has been used in the past, and therefore why cannot it be used now? But for a long time fiscal legislation has referred to charities. Churches are charities because, as hon. Gentlemen know, they fall within one of the heads of the old Statute of Elizabeth. They exist for the advancement of religion and are defined as charities.<br><br>
But to try to say on the one hand "churches" and on the other "charities" gives the impression that it is easy for us to draw a distinction between churches and other charities. It is not. Churches are charities, and what we are talking
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 732</span>
about is giving an exemption to charities. Some charities do not own any land or property. Other charities, in particular the churches, own land, or hold it, not as an investment, but because without that land there would be no reason for their existence. They may invest surplus funds in other property, but without being physically present on land—if I may so describe it—they would not exist.<br><br>
Therefore, the way in which charities differ, especially in the case of churches, from pension funds is that many charities, and particularly the churches, operate in the way I have described. Churches, especially those in the centre of cities, have a problem, which was put to us. When the population moves out into the suburbs, the churches have to move with the people. Often, due to the high price of land in the suburbs, the only way that a new church can be built is by selling a site in the middle of a town, which may not be worth much to the church itself because no one attends there any more, but which may be worth a great deal if developed as an office building or a hotel complex. Therefore, the church sells the site and re-invests the prodeeds in land in the suburbs with perhaps something left over for investment.<br><br>
That case was put to us in respect of charities, but especially the churches clement of charities. We thought that that was a reasonable case. We cannot seem to win with representations. If we do not give way to representations, we are told that we are being dogmatic, ideological, stubborn, and so on. When we give way, we are told that we have done so because it is politically expedient. I think those were the words used by the hon. Gentleman. He was a little unfair to say that. It may be politically expedient to give way to the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. I know not. But we have attempted to assess—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not give way to the Conservative Party?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On some occasions we might even do that. Now that it is the perpetual party of Opposition, possibly the Conservative Party is one of the major institutions of the realm and we might give way to it. But I suggest that it is unfair to chastise the Government for giving way to representations.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0963">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 733</span>
I point out, however, that this concession applied only to land owned before 12th September, 1974, because so many of the churches were held and owned in the centre of cities. There has been a movement out of the cities. Therefore, churches existing at that time will not be affected. In furute the churches may have a problem, and we shall debate that topic when we return to the amendment. We do not think that they will have a problem, but it is possible.<br><br>
That is why I have tried to explain that churches somehow fall between. We have the local authorities at one end, pension funds possibly at the other, and churches falling in the middle. We have therefore provided a modicum of exemption for them. I accept that the subject of pension funds is important. We have taken it seriously. I have met representatives of the National Association of Pension Funds, as has my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. We have received a large number of representations, but, given the nature of the legislation, I do not think that I can go further and give exemption to pension funds. There might be other organisations which have equally good cases to put. Other charities are a</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 86, in page 15, line 41, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>h</i>) a charity '.</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment we shall take New Clause 2—<i>Exemption for charities:</i>
<br><blockquote><p>'(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, development land tax shall not be chargeable on any realised development value accruing to a charity on the disposal of an interest in land.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(2)If an interest in land held on charitable trusts ceases to be subject to charitable trusts—

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 734</span>
<p>different matter, and we shall discuss them later.</p>
<p>I rest my argument on the remarks I have made, and say that, although we accept the force of the argument, we cannot accept either of the amendments—neither that seeking a general exemption nor the amendment seeking a partial exemption on the lines of the exemption for charities.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have indicated that Amendment No. 84 can be moved formally later on. I shall put this amendment to the vote now. The Question is—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jack Dunnett</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. Yesterday I sought leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I indicated yesterday that, if leave to withdraw an amendment is sought and somebody else speaks, it means that there is an objection to the withdrawal and that the amendment must be put to the Committee, so I am putting the Question now. I shall put the Question now.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 10.</p>
<p>market value, any realised development value on the disposal being treated as not accruing to a charity, and</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) if and so far as that interest represents, directly or indirectly the consideration for the disposal of assets by the trustees, any realised development value on that disposal shall be treated as not having accrued to a charity</p>
<p>and any assessment to development land tax by virtue of paragraph (<i>b</i>) above may be made at any time not more than three years after the end of the year of assessment in which said interest ceases to be subject to charitable trusts'.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 86 seeks to add "a charity" to the list of exempt bodies set out in Clause 11—that is, the bodies in respect of which no development land tax will be chargeable when they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0964">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 735</span>
dispose of property and realise development value. New Clause 2, which accompanies the amendment, seeks to do the same thing in a rather longer way—that is, to exempt charities completely from the liability to tax.<br><br>
As the Committee knows from our discussions on previous amendments, charities are, later in the Bill, partially excluded in respect of property which belonged to them on White Paper Day on 12th September 1974 if they utilise that in certain ways.<br><br>
I agree immediately with what the Minister said in his winding-up speech on the last amendment, that it is a fallacy to talk of churches and charities. Certainly, in these amendments we deal with all charities. Some may have a better case than others, but within the term "charities" we include not only the ordinary voluntary welfare bodies, whether they be providing a service for invalids, or for persons in a certain geographical area of a certain kind, or even of a certain sex, when one thinks of such voluntary organisations as the Women's Institutes and Townswomen's Guilds.<br><br>
So the amendment will include the ordinary welfare societies as well as the churches. It includes such matters as charities may be supporting as the voluntary schools supported by church funds and also includes the colleges, sports clubs and social clubs, those organisations which are not run for profit.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
I want to take a wide view of what we mean by charities and what we are asking to be exempted from the tax. Whether or not one likes a particular kind of charity is irrelevant in this argument, if it is thought that some bodies now included within the legal definition of "charity" are not deserving of release from tax of this kind because they do not devote their funds sufficiently to the kind of services which the Bill seeks to exempt in the other paragraphs of this clause, or if for some other reason they are not considered to be what we would these days call a charity.<br><br>
But that is irrelevant to our discussions in this Bill. If the scope of the legal charity should be restricted, that should be done in a Bill directed particularly to charities. My view is that there is no need to amend the law on charities in regard to the inclusion of charitable
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 736</span>
bodies. We amended that law as recently as 1960, and I do not see any need to amend it again. At any rate, it is irrelevant to talk about amending it in connection with the Development Land Tax Bill.<br><br>
Before I deal with the merits of the case for these amendments, I should like to dispose of one point which puzzles me and which refers to the exemption of charities within the Bill as well as the complete exemption we seek in these amendments.<br><br>
When is a charity an individual in order to take advantage of the £10,000 limit or the £150,000 tranche? Are charities out of that altogether, or are they entitled to the benefit of those provisions! If they are entitled to the benefit, how does the local club fare against the national charity? It would be grossly unfair if small clubs throughout the country could claim the £10,000 exemption and yet a national charity could also claim that only once.<br><br>
I think that would also apply to the churches in particular because, as I understand it, the Church of England holds its property as one corporation, whereas the Methodist church is a separate corporation for either each church or each area I am not sure which.<br><br>
Possibly I have not read the Bill well enough and have not turned to Clause 23 with as much attention as I ought, but it seems to be a point that we should clear up now.<br><br>
I should like now to put the case on its merits. I think perhaps it is best put in the memorandum, which I expect all members of the Committee have received, of the Churches Main Committee. I always think that phrase has a catchy rhythm—it is rather like when Mr. Speaker says:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Clerk will now proceed to read the Orders of the Day"—</p></blockquote>
and I always want to continue—
<br><blockquote><p>"… and his soul goes marching on",</p></blockquote>
because of the rhythm of the phrase. When I say "The Churches Main Committee", I always want to start off the first line of the hymn—
<br><blockquote><p>"The Churches main foundation"</p></blockquote>
But I will not continue with the second line, because my argument will be that part of its main foundations is property.<br><br>
The case is well put in the memorandum which we have received, and which I am
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0965">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 737</span>
sure all hon. Members have received, from the Churches Main Committee. The Committee points out that the proposals, as they stand in the Bill, though they give some exemption to the churches and charities—and I use that phrase particularly when I am quoting from the Churches Main Committee's memorandum—
<br><blockquote><p>"pose a serious threat to the future work of the Churches and other charities because in many cases land represents their main asset,"</p></blockquote>
That is why I talked about "the main foundation". It is certainly one of the foundations of the church to own property and one on which, to continue the quotation from the Churches Main Committee's paper:
<br><blockquote><p>"they have depended for centuries, not only to meet their operational needs, hut also as a hedge against inflation and to help to finance their charitable activities generally."</p></blockquote>
So, the churches are beings quite frank about this, that the increase in the value of property assists them in their charitable work, in this case in the work of the churches. The churches and charities will not, they say, be liable to development land tax on developing or disposing of any land which was charity land on the day when the scheme was first announced back on White Paper day. They also point out that on developing for their own use the charities will escape development land tax, but they say that this is not good enough. This will not help them to any very great extent. This distinction between property which they held on White Paper day and property which they acquire afterwards—and here I quote again from the memorandum—
<br><blockquote><p>"will inevitably make Churches and charities chary of giving up land which they owned on White Paper day. But if they are to move with the times and adapt themselves to new needs and movements of population it is very often essential that they should dispose of land in one place and acquire it in another."</p></blockquote>
That was an argument which the Minister put forward as a distinction between pension funds and churches in particular, as one category of charities. The Churches Main Committee goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"Again, in the case of land purchased since White Paper Day and subsequently found to be unsuitable (perhaps because too small to meet a growing need), a sale may produce a tax liability, whereas the replacement site would have to be acquired at market value. The result over the long term must therefore tend to ossify the work of the Churches and charities and make them less responsibe to new needs."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 738</span>
I suggest that this is basically a very strong point in the churches' favour.<br><br>
The reason for exempting charities, if I understand the position correctly, is that they provide a service which otherwise might have to be provided by public authorities. In fact, the Minister for Planning and Local Government said last July that
<br><blockquote><p>"The Government accept that charities are in a unique position. Traditionally they have provided services to the community that would otherwise have to be provided by central or local government, and that is the sole reason they are in being."</p></blockquote>
Speaking at the Annual General Meeting of the National Council of Social Service, the right hon. Gentleman, who was then the Prime Minister, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"voluntary organisations have the ability to provide a form of service which the State is ill fitted to provide, however dedicated its administrators. However much the State can provide for the basic requirements of the social services, the role of voluntary organisations will not be diminished."</p></blockquote>
There is no doubt whatever that if, out of their property on disposal, these bodies have to pay this tax, their powers to provide those services will be seriously diminished. We should remember that we are talking about either 66⅔ per cent. or 80 per cent. but the whole basis of this tax when combined with the Community Land Act is that it will eventually become 100 per cent. As the Opposition believe that the present Government will not be in office long enough to produce the alteration in the law of the second appointed day under the Community Land Act, we are arguing on a basis of only 66⅔ per cent. or 80 per cent. I imagine that the Government put this forward as the tax which will be overtaken by the second appointed day under the Community Land Act, and that all development value will be confiscated.<br><br>
If that is the case, and even if it is only a matter of percentage at present, it means that that development value will not be put back into the funds of the charity for those charitable purposes.<br><br>
Is there good reason for depriving a charity of those funds which will return to it if they are not taken from it? The public understand the Development Land Tax Bill to be a Bill which taxes the speculator and the profit-maker who happens to own land and disposes of it at a figure which is dependent on the land having increased in value since he acquired
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0966">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 739</span>
it. That can be understood as a tax on something which it may be proper to tax. Whether one adds the argument that this development value was provided by the community and therefore should return to the community, is questionable. In many cases it cannot be said that the increase in value was created by those to whom the development value will be returned.<br><br>
So the Churches Main Committee makes its second point that:
<br><blockquote><p>"the distinction between development for a Church or charity's own use"</p></blockquote>
which is to be free of development land tax
<br><blockquote><p>and development for other purposes "</p></blockquote>
which will not
<br><blockquote><p>"may well inhibit many schemes of importance to the community".</p></blockquote>
In particular, the Committee points out that it is necessary at times for a charity to raise money on its property to carry out its charitable purposes. If the land is to become subject to a tax, thereby greatly reduced in its security value, it would be difficult to raise money on that land to carry out charitable purposes.<br><br>
So the churches are restricted not only in the sale of land and the investment of the money in other property for charitable purposes, but in raising money on their land to carry out their charitable purposes.<br><br>
11 a.m.<br><br>
It is clear that in the past all Governments have recognised the particular importance of charities—the fact that they provide services which otherwise the State would have to provide—and the proposals in the Bill ignore the fact that churches and charities have always been exempt from direct taxation on the grounds that they provide a public benefit. They have been exempt from the development charge under the old Town and Country Planning Act 1947; they were exempt from the betterment levy under the Land Commission Act 1967, and from development gains tax under the Finance Act 1974. They are partially exempt from capital transfer tax, and I understand that the Government have announced that, if they introduce a wealth tax, charities will be exempt.<br><br>
Therefore, the Bill will stick out like a sore thumb as the one under which charities will be taxed and will have part of the value of their property taken away
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 740</span>
from them instead of their being allowed to put it back into the services which are recognised as for the public benefit.<br><br>
In addition to the memorandum which members of the Committee will have received from the Churches Main Committee, I have no doubt that other Members of the Committee have received the same sort of representations as I have received from a great number of sources. Following the argument of the Churches Main Committee, I have received representations, for example, from the Bishop of Worcester who makes this rather important addition to the case put by the Churches Main Committee. The Bishop points out that
<br><blockquote><p>"assets in the hands of charities already belong to the community, because they have to be directed solely to the benefit of the community. If the Bill is passed without amendment, it will mean that for the first time part of the value of a charity's land can be confiscated and applied to public purposes chosen not by the donors, but by the Government."</p></blockquote>
This, I think, is an additional point to those put forward by the Churches Main Committee. The Bishop of Worcester goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"This undermines the long-accepted principle whereby the State has guaranteed to enforce the purposes of charitable trusts against all corners."</p></blockquote>
Indeed, the Bishop is correct in that. After all, we have set up the Charity Commissioners who are very much controlled by the law as to the purpose of the funds. The law supports the restrictions on the charity from using its funds for any purposes other than those dictated by the donors. It is only when those purposes fail that one can alter the destination of the charitable funds and, in order to do that, one has to get the consent of the authorities in the courts.<br><br>
The Bishop of Worcester then says:
<br><blockquote><p>"What I am seeking is the maintenance of the principle that the assets of charities should be protected, so that under the law they may continue to be employed for the purposes for which they were given."</p></blockquote>
It may be that many of us who have dealt with the law of charities from time to time and the <i>cy-press</i> doctrine have felt rather aggravated sometimes that we have not been able, without a lot of formalities, to alter the purposes for which a gift was given. But there it is in law, and I think it right to make that point. The law protects the donor's intentions.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0967">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 741</span>
The Bishop also makes the point that
<br><blockquote><p>"there should at least be provision that all development of land belonging to a charity, including that which is solely a capital income-producing one, should be regarded as development for its own use in that revenue from such development will accrue to the charity and pass thereby to the community through the work of that charity."</p></blockquote>
Additional points have been made by a number of the archdeacons and secretaries of dioceses. I do not want to weary the Committee by quoting them all. But this extract follows on from the quotations I gave from the letter from the Bishop of Worcester. It is from the Archdeacon of Wandsworth, who says:
<br><blockquote><p>"If, for example, a church wishes to erect an office block on a redundant site (owned even before 12th September 1974) in order to finance the building of an old people's home elsewhere it could not do so without tax liability, as, by the terms of the Bill, it would not be regarded as development for the church's own use. …. In the coming years, there could well be examples of this very case as the church at large moves into a decade of considerable redeployment of men and buildings."</p></blockquote>
We have the same sort of representations from the Diocese of Gloucester, the Archdeacon of St. Albans, and other church authorities, who are deeply concerned about the reduction in their assets which will occur from the provisions of the Bill.<br><br>
So far I have dealt only with representations from the churches. But the representations we have received from the National Council of Social Service run along very much the same lines, presenting similar arguments, although perhaps in a broader sense, because the National Council deals with so many charities other than churches. The same sort of objections are voiced, that charities are providing a public service, but if they realise development value that money goes back into that public service in the same way as when a local authority which realises development value puts the money back into the services provided by it.<br><br>
If the Government recognise that for a time the charities should receive the same exemption as local authorities, I cannot see the logic in drawing a line between property which they held on White Paper day and property acquired afterwards. There is perhaps an argument that, if we apply the provision to property held on White Paper day, it is retrospective legislation. Charities could not be expected not to be able to use the development value of their property when they bought it. Therefore, they might be relieved of the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 742</span>
tax on that ground. If we apply the basic principle of relieving a body which provides a community service, there is no logic in applying it only to property held on White Paper day.<br><br>
I revert to the subject of providing a community service. I still cannot understand the Minister's argument put forward on the previous amendment, that in order to provide a community service, it must be in general, or at large, or whatever phrase the hon. Gentleman uses. The hon. Gentleman said that a local authority provides services to the community at large because it provides them within a certain geographical area. For the life of me I cannot see why that should be defied as to the community at large, or any more at large than, say, the National Spastics Association, which provides a service nationally. The Church of England, has a corporation that provides a community service, I am not sure about the Catholic Church, because it is probably the separate orders which carry out community service. But these churches provide just as much a community service at large as some of those bodies set out already in Clause 11.<br><br>
I said that I was including within charities, and the subsection of charities under the heading of churches, the sorts of voluntary body which the churches support. In particular, we have had representations from the Bishop of Chester and the Diocese of Salisbury about the voluntary schools. I think I should put before the Committee the points which are there made: that they consider there is a grave danger to the ability of the Church to support the voluntary schools in future if its assets are to be decreased by acquisition tax.<br><br>
The Bishop of Chester in a letter dated 14th April 1976 says:
<br><blockquote><p>"… it is quite inevitable that with the passage of years there will be less and less land that was in charitable ownership on White Paper Day and more and more land that was acquired for charitable purposes after White Paper Day and on the sale or development of which tax will become payable under the Bill. In the particular case of the voluntary schools it was envisaged by Parliament, when they enacted the series of Education Acts of 1944 and subsequent years up to 1973, that the funds required by the churches to sustain their participation in the national maintained schools system would be derived mainly from the sale of land and buildings no longer required for educational purposes."</p></blockquote>
I think that is a point which is not generally appreciated. From my reading
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0968">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 743</span>
of the debates at that time, although I was not in the House in 1944, and of future educational legislation it is apparent that when one is looking to the churches for support of the maintained schools it has always been recognised that they do so by the sale of existing properties.<br><br>
The Bishop of Chester goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"The application of Development Land Tax to the proceeds from a growing proportion of such sales will inevitably in the long term stifle and frustrate the efforts of the churches to make what they and Parliament have hitherto seen as their proper contribution to the schools system of the country."</p></blockquote>
He then goes on to make some of the other points which I have already mentioned that were made by the Churches Main Committee in its memorandum.<br><br>
I have received quite a volume of representations from this colleges on this subject. For example, the memorandum from the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any DLT paid by universities would reduce their financial resources. The result would be an inevitable increase in the calls by universities on Government funds.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Universities were likely to lose many benefactions from both home and abroad, since intending benefactors would be reluctant to make gifts of land to universities where the full benefit of the gift did not continue to be available for higher education purposes."</p></blockquote>
That is the point that I was making just now about the protection of the donor's intentions by our law as it exists at present.<br><br>
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals goes on to say:
<br><blockquote><p>"There would be a consequent loss of additional capacity for research, which had been made possible in many cases only by private benefaction, often in the form of a gift of land."</p></blockquote>
The Committee says later in its memorandum:
<br><blockquote><p>"Universities would for the first time have to pay tax if they wished to sell or lease development land which had been given by individual or corporate benefactors.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The kind of mixed development schemes, where sales of leases of shops and/or offices were, in the past, used to keep down the rents of student residences provided in the same development, would no longer be financially viable."</p></blockquote>
The other representations that I have received have come from the various colleges both at Oxford and at Cambridge. There is one point I should like to quote from a letter from the Senior Bursar of St. John's College, Cambridge in which he draws a distinction between functional and income-producing land.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 744</span>
He says:
<br><blockquote><p>"I do not believe that this distinction, which has artificially been introduced in the Development Land Tax Bill, is sensible. The extremely wide range of Charities which exist utilise a multitude of different combinations of land used for the direct purposes of the Charity and land used to produce income for furthering those purposes. This distinction will reduce the flexibility of action of charities as well as costing them tax—and both types of land are equally serving the community."</p></blockquote>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Similar points are made from all Souls College, Magdalen College, Oxford. I quote from a letter written by the Bursar of Magdalen College, Oxford:
<br><blockquote><p>"… if a development value accrues to a charity, it also accrues to the community. I had thought that the prime target for this pending legislation was the private developer and his profit; that charities are in danger of being 'winged' by the same shot is not only deplorable; it is just plain silly—almost, from the community viewpoint, a self-inflicted wound."</p></blockquote>
I entirely agree with the Bursar.<br><br>
I come now to the last item—clubs, both sporting and social, which are charities as much as the churches. They provide benefirs which would otherwise have to be provided by those authorities set out in Clause 11. I received a letter from the Worthing Rugby Football Club—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad my hon. Friend says "Hear, hear". I assure him that I have received letters not only from the South but also from the North and the Midlands, from clubs of all kinds, including archery clubs.<br><br>
The letter from Worthing Rugby Football Club states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Notwithstanding the changes now proposes "—</p></blockquote>
that is, the small relief given to charities under the Bill—
<br><blockquote><p>"my Club would still have considerable difficulty in financing their project if it has to pay development land tax even at 66⅔ per cent.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>If the Club has to pay development land tax at that rate then either the Club will have to substantially reduce"—</p></blockquote>
that splits the infinitive—
<br><blockquote><p>—the quality of the project or alternatively the Club will have to apply to the Sports Council, Central Government and Local Government for substantial grants".</p></blockquote>
The latter foes on to explain that in some detail.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0969">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 745</span>
Perhaps the Minister can give consideration to the sentence the writer adds, namely:
<br><blockquote><p>"This problem can be overcome if roll-over relief is available".</p></blockquote>
That might well be a matter for consideration when we are dealing with such c'ubs.<br><br>
The next letter from which I quote is from Brookdale Social Club, Stockport, Cheshire which states:
<br><blockquote><p>"The Club is poised to commence further development work, comprising two new halls, an improved dressing room/committee room and overall general improvements to the external appearance of the building. The Officers are somewhate concerned that, should we commence development after 1st August 1976, we may become liable to the above tax on any material developments to the Club buildings. Even if this does not prove to be the case, it may well be that the Club will have to spend many hundreds of pounds in professional fees to obtain and agree terms with the District Valuer and H.M. Inspector of Taxes. It is the view of the General Committee of the Club that the proposed Development Land Tax should not apply to a club, which is not a trading concern and which, by improving its premises, will in any event, become liable to pay increased rates".</p></blockquote>
I think in that case, reading between the lines, that the club already owns the property and owned it on White Paper day. But the principle still spplies. There will be many a club which will wish to acquire property now, and to use that property for the purposes of the club, under circumstances in which the club will receive no exemption under the Bill.<br><br>
I have quoted from these representations at some length and have probably wearied the Committee in doing so, but those who have taken the trouble to make representations to us and who are deeply concerned with the effects of the Bill in terms of their ability to carry out charitable purposes, are entitled to have their cases put, even at the length of quoting from their representations. They have worded the case far better than I could ever put it for them, and in every case on the merits they are entitled to exemption from the tax—whether it be the churches, the voluntary schools supported by the churches, the universities, or the colleges within the universities, the sporting clubs or the social clubs, the voluntary societies for the disabled, voluntary societies for educational purposes, or sports clubs.<br><br>
I hope that the Government will have second thoughts on this matter and will not be the first Government to impose this sort of penalty on those who are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 746</span>
trying to provide community services to the public, services of a charitable nature, which are already well-controlled by the law and in the use of which there can be no abuse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like first to congratulate my right hon. Friend, who has made many excellent contributions to our proceedings, on the comprehensive way in which he presented this most important amendment. I feel slightly nervous in following such a distinguished and wide-ranging contribution.<br><br>
We are discussing not only one of the clearest and shortest of amendments to the Bill, but also one of the most important. Indeed, for clarity and shortness, I would recommend this amendment to the parliamentary draftsmen. I know that they encounter many difficulties on many complicated points, but an amendment which provides in page 15, line 41, at end to insert, "'(<i>h</i>) a charity'", is a matter for congratulation on its clarity and brevity.<br><br>
This matter is of enormous importance. My right hon. Friend has already quoted from numerous representations received by Members of both sides of the Committee on this vital subject.<br><br>
I do not intend to quote from the same sources, but there cannot be a Member on either side of the Committee who, on considering the situation in his constituency, cannot be aware of the enormous importance in human terms of the daily work of charities. Each of our constituencies varies in its socio-economic composition, as it might be called, but there cannot be one constituency in which the various roles of the voluntary associations and charities are not doing something to alleviate suffering and to contribute towards the welfare of the community—and doing so under so many different headings.<br><br>
Whatever the disagreements on housing policy may be between the parties, I doubt whether there are any of our constituencies where charities are not making a valuable contribution to housing policy, to housing provision—and particularly to housing provision—for the groups which tend to be least catered for by both the private and public sector. I have in mind the elderly, and particularly the elderly in need of sheltered accommodation.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0970">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 747</span>
Indeed, it is a matter for regret that so much money, time and effort have been devoted by public sector housing to providing standard two- or three-bed-roomed houses and not nearly enough to providing sheltered accommodation for the disabled. We are left with a public sector housing stock of the wrong composition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Cartwright</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is surely not suggesting that local authorities do not provide sheltered accommodation. If he is suggesting that, I can point to a number of local authorities in the Greater London area with a very good record for providing sheltered accommodation of all kinds.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for that intervention. Of course I am not suggesting that local authorities do not provide sheltered accommodation at all. What I am saying—and I think it is of great significance to this amendment—is that they have not provided nearly enough. One has only to look at the document just put out by the Department of Health and Social Security on priorities in health and social security, which brings out the massive shortfall in the provision of sheltered accommodation throughout the country. There can be very few, if any, local authority areas where the requirements for sheltered accommodation have been adequately or entirely met.<br><br>
I doubt even more that the provision is not most nearly met without considerable help from charitable bodies. In my area it is the charitable bodies that have provided—and I think this is a matter of regret—the majority of the sheltered accommodation for the elderly. We have a very large masonic home and a Church Army home. A wide variety of bodies have provided sheltered accommodation and they provide it much more than local authorities. We know that inevitably in the present economic circumstances it will be difficult for local authorities to make up the shortfall, when they identify and recognise it, and that it will take a very lohg time. But that is just one example of how in every constituency charities are playing an invaluable role.<br><br>
One problem which is of considerable concern to directors of social services in county or metropolitan authorities—certainly in the East Sussex and the Brighton and Hove area—is the care of children.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 748</span>
We are, unhappily, aware of the number of children at risk, particularly in the sad cases of child battering, and they have been brought to our attention because the social services have not been able to deal with them and prevent abuse of the child. I am sure that no director of social services would say that he would like to do without the help of organisations such as the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, whose numerous and well-paid officers work in close collaboration with the social services. That body is just one of a number of organisations providing essential help to the public sector care for children.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend referred to schools and colleges. I feel that religious education and the maintenance in ordinary schools of a Christian content is under threat at present. We have seen motions tabled which seem to take away the Christian content of education in ordinary public schools, and we know, from our own experience, the views of some on this matter. The church schools perhaps play a more vital rule at this time than they ever have in the past. To my knowledge, it has not been public education that has been under pressure to take Christianity out of its curriculum. If that happens—and I hope that all here will act to prevent it happening—the role of the church school will become that much more vital. In education church schools do not provide more than a small proportion of their total cost, but they provide something else—a religious content to the education. That is another example of work of a charitable body.<br><br>
In my area we are desperately lacking in day care provision. Again, attention was drawn to that in the recently published document from the Department of Health and Social Security. With more day centres, more home helps, and more voluntary organisations visiting particularly the elderly and the disabled, those people can be kept in their own homes which is where they want to be.</span></p>
<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want the hon. Gentleman to be under a misconception. He may not be, but perhaps I should make the matter clear. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not mean that normal development by a charity for the purposes of an old people's home or day care will be charged to DLT.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0971">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 749</span>
The hon. Gentleman knows that those cases are exempt, because the development is for charitable use. We are concerned only with commercial development. Therefore in the cases mentioned, for example, of an old people's home being developed by a charity for its own charitable purposes, the hon. Gentleman knows that that development would not be taxed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's comment. I talked about the vital rôle played by charitable organisations in helping the community and alleviating suffering, particularly in the underprivileged sections of the community. I agree that the actual buildings used for those purposes are exempt. But, as my right hon. Friend so eloquently demonstrated, so often these activities are funded by investments in property. I referred to day centres, which are another example of a service that perhaps local authorities should provide but which they have under-provided, and voluntary bodies are filling the gap.<br><br>
I could go on giving examples. There is medical research into various conditions such as muscular distrophy, spastics, and so on. Another area, which the public sector finds it difficult to deal with, is the situation of the least-privileged section of the community. I mean the alcoholics, the single homeless, and so on. CHAR, the Campaign for the Homeless and Rootless, works closely with the Department. But in practice the problem with these people means that a voluntary body, a charitable or church body, is more likely to be able to make contact with them and help meet their needs than the almost inevitably bureaucratic methods used, understandably, by the public sector. In that area charities play a tremendously valuable part.<br><br>
The activities of these bodies are all tied to the fundamental point concerning churches, already elaborated on by my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). The amendment is of vital importance. I am sure no one would disagree on the value of the work of these organisations, and particularly now, given the problem facing the public sector in trying even to staff and continue to operate the services already functioning, let alone increase them to meet known needs.<br><br>
The Minister of State said that he was not proposing directly to attack the work
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 750</span>
of these organisations. I am sure that is not his intention, even egged on by the most determined Treasury Ministers. But as my right hon. Friend and I have said, what we know from personal experience and from scrutiny of the accounts of any of these bodies is that often a major part of the funds of charitable associations is held in property. I imagine that the reason in many cases is that the original foundation arose from the will of some public-spirited person who left some or all of his land for charitable purposes. I am a trustee of a charity called the Charity of John Marshall. He died in 1627, leaving his farm and other property to endow the charity for the relief of poor livings and the construction of new churches. He just missed having the best pitch in Sutton High Street in his farm land. Sutton was, of course, a small village then and he could not know what would happen. But the charity still owns a substantial part of Sutton High Street. Some buildings were let on 99-year leases which are nearing their end, which indicates that that is the only area due for redevelopment. The local authority may introduce widening schemes which may require some of the property to be purchased from the charity, which will then wish to reinvest in property. About 90 per cent. of the charity's funds has been in property for the past 348 years.<br><br>
That is an example why so many charities hold so much of their funds in property. A trustee trying to maximise the revenue of a charity so that it can carry out more of the work for which it is designed aims to manage the resources to produce as large an income as possible. As my right hon. Friend has already pointed out, without the amendment that work will be struck in two ways. First, it is directly threatened by this line being drawn concerning property acquired after a certain date. Charities are perpetual bodies. Good trustees will not regard 1974 as a recent date. They will be conscious, as are the trustees of the Charity of John Marshall, when they look at the list of chairmen stretching back over nearly 350 years, that they must be concerned to pass on to their successors in 50, 100 or 200 years' time, the assets of the charity in the best possible condition.<br><br>
Over that time 1974 will seem an historic date of little significance. The records will have to be kept well so that it is known in 2174 whether a particular piece of property was held before or after
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0972">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 751</span>
1974. Therefore the first direct threat arises from saying that it is all right if the property was held before 1974, but that it is not all right if for any reason it was acquired thereafter.<br><br>
Returning to my example of Marhsall's charity, Sutton Borough Council may buy two properties for road widening. The money is received by the charity. What does it do with it? It would like to put it back into its Sutton estates, after having owned them for so long a time. It would like to reinvest it, but that would mean that the holding was acquired after 1974. So that in another 40 or 50 years a problem might arise for that charity.<br><br>
There is a second threat which should be considered. That is the problem of discouraging redevelopment. In a crowded island such as ours I suggest that we should not do anything to discourage all owners from making the best use of their property holdings. It is one of the unfortunate aspects of this legislation that due to exemptions relating to rebuilding and the 10 per cent. tolerance, there will be strong fiscal discouragement to carrying out development which does not fall within the exemptions, even if that development were to be a better use of the land concerned. Charities will be in that situation and would be discouraged because they would be likely to be taxed. That would be a sort of traumatic shock to the trustees of a charity. Until now they have never had to think about taxation as a problem in the management of their affairs. Why suddenly in this Bill should they be faced with this problem for the first time? I believe they will be discouraged from managing their assets as expertly and efficiently as they should.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend used the phrase "ossify the work". I think it is a very good phrase. Ossification can be a very long and slow process, but the end result is just as disastrous. We are looking at perpetual bodies and ossification of their ability to manage their assets will be just as disastrous, whether it takes 50 or 100 years to be completed.<br><br>
There is an example of another aspect of the work of churches and charities which is affected by the Bill as it stands. In my constituency the United Reformed Church having united is left holding two churches. It has concluded that what it really needs is one church. It has quite extensive development areas in Brighton
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 752</span>
on both sites and would like to provide on one site a new and more convenient church premises together with a social provision. The local authority is extremely anxious to see a social provision provided in this central location: it has no land in that area and there is a great need for it. I understand that the scheme, has the local authority's blessing.<br><br>
The other half of the scheme, which required a great degree of persuasion to get the blessing of the Department of the Environment, is the disposal of the redundant church premises and the associated land to the Institute of Personnel Management to be used as a national headquarters. The redundant church premises, which is a scheduled building, will provide a most convenient meeting hall for the Institute of Personnel Management which will construct offices on the remainder of the land.<br><br>
In this particular case I think I would be right in saying that there would be no problem. This is premises held for a long time. Surely no other institution—if one can call the church an institution in affairs—could more likely claim to be a perpetual body. If we look ahead 100 years or so, there will be other amalgamations of churches. The church where I most regularly worship—both of them, for we have combined parishes—is just over 100 years old. I doubt whether we shall go on for another 100 years without needing to carry out some form of redeployment of physical resources. There will be new churches built that in 100 years will become redundant because of a shift in population or an amalgamation. These schemes which are so vital will be absolutely prevented.<br><br>
It is not an immediate threat. I would not think it was even a medium-term threat giving the medium-term the longest normal extension. But it is certainly a long-term threat to the work of charities. Therefore, as legislators it is our duty to avoid producing even long-term threats to the rôle and the work of charities and churches in our midst.<br><br>
My right hon. Friend has particularly emphasised what is the logic for drawing this line based upon whether the land was held on 12th September 1974. There is a risk, and I am sure that the Minister has identified this, if a total exemption is given to charities as proposed by the amendment.<br><br>
I think I am right in saying that a charity
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0973">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 753</span>
could purchase some white land—farming land—and if it were able to get away without an extension of its planning application by the local authority by being an exempt body, it could carry out a nice commercial development and dispose of it and reap the full development gain to itself, and then go on again. Instead of the great property companies of this country being major developers and providers of the facilities which the housewife enjoys in the shopping centres, and also those enjoyed by workers in their factories and warehouses, suddenly we would have massive charitable developments. It would not be Harry Hams who would be the man most mentioned in these Committees, but perhaps the Bishop of Worcester—to whom my hon. Friend referred—who was the great developer.<br><br>
There is a risk involved here. I would not have thought that any body of trustees or any institution of the nature which we are discussing would carry out this sort of activity. But if one charity were to decide that it would like to try to do this and act as a specially privileged purchaser and developer of property, surely this would be undesirable. It would not be the intention of my right hon. and hon. Friends that the passing of this amendment would enable that sort of activity to be carried out.<br><br>
However, as so often with Opposition amendments, I am sure that my right hon. Friend would accept from the Government side any appropriately worded provision to prevent this loophole being exploited. It is highly unlikely that it would be so exploited. But it would be relatively easy to draft some appropriate provision requiring the land to be held for a period of time—for example, to form part of the endowments for a minimum period, or for the land to have been used for a minimum period for the actual purposes of the charity.<br><br>
11.45 a.m.<br><br>
I recognise that there is an unlikely risk of this amendment creating a specially privileged category of property developer, who would reap development gains entirely for its own purposes and thereby become able to buy property for development at a price rather greater than anybody else. Even if this were to occur, one might reasonably take the view that one should one worry that much because it
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 754</span>
would merely mean that the particular charity carrying out this activity would have a bonus on its income.<br><br>
The answer is that we should worry because it would give that charity a peculiar advantage over some of its other charities who would not be so anxious to carry out that sort of activity.<br><br>
Finally, I come to the problem of sporting clubs. The whole relationship of sport and charitable cases is difficult. It is a matter to which I hope in due course the House will be able to turn its attention. It seems to me anomalous that an Olympic appeal fund has no charitable status. There is a difficulty in obtaining charitable status for sporting purposes. Some sporting clubs and sporting organisations have such status; some do not. I think the point that my right hon. Friend mentioned of roll-over relief is a valuable one in this context. I hope that the Minister in his reply will be able to say something on that idea. It could have some help in the charitable side as well.<br><br>
I think this short, clear amendment is of great importance. If we can see a little charitable spirit displayed by the Government side on any one of the amendments, I would hope that it would be on this one because it is of paramount importance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had not meant to intervene in this debate, but a number of comments prompted me to do so, particularly those made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury).<br><br>
Despite the simplicity of this amendment, I suspect we will not get anywhere in this matter. The reason is that on the question of charities, there may well he a deep issue of principle between the two parties. I do not want to provoke the Minister of State into yet another political outburst, because I did that yesterday.<br><br>
I suspect there are at least four Socialist reasons for rejecting this amendment. The first was indicated in a significant intervention from the hon. Member for Woolwich, East (Mr. Cartwright)—namely, that a charity tends to show up the public sector. The interchange which took place between my hon. Friend the Member for Hove and the hon. Member for Woolwich, East clearly indicates that the Socialists—decreasingly, perhaps —are concerned about charities as a competitor, if not a direct threat to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0974">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 755</span>
public sector. It is the Opposition's contention, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hove stated, that one should not see charities in this light. The Government see it in that light, but we see it as an additional resource.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend not agree that those who discuss these matters with the professionals involved—that is, the staff in the Social Services Departments—would find a very different attitude, namely a great appreciation of the valuable and essential work of the charities as an aid to the public sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend knows more about this matter than I do. I suspect that what he says is absolutely true. There is, however, among professionals to whom I have spoken, a concern about the whole role of the trade unions in charities, to which I will refer briefly in a moment.<br><br>
The first reason for suspecting that we will not get anywhere in this matter is that there is a growing issue of principle between us on the relationship between charities and the public sector. Charities are not liked by the Socialists because in some way they show up the public sector, but also because they regard them as messy. They do not fit into any great plan.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman realise that the Socialist party has always relied only on faith and hope?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That was a very helpful intervention.<br><br>
The second reason why I suspect there is a growing issue of principle is one to which the Minister of State referred yesterday during the debate on pension funds. His main argument was that whereas this Bill benefits everybody, pensions benefit individuals, and therefore pension funds should not be exempted. I suspect he will use the same argument in respect of charities.<br><br>
This is a timeless argument. It was best put by Rousseau when he developed the theory that the general will was greater than the will of all. Unfortunately, he did more to futher the Socialist cause than any other philosopher by making that statement. I think it is a great myth.<br><br>
The Opposition argue that one should
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 756</span>
be concerned with ensuring that the individual parts of a society are thriving and are excellent. The whole philosophy on which charities are based is the concept of individuals helping each other without necessarily referring to the State. That is something which we believe to be of inestimable value. For Socialists to say "They are helping only a part, and we are helping the whole", is a myth and something which in the end is to the detriment of society.<br><br>
I believe that the way to have a healthy society is not by generalising concepts like the general good, which Socialists so often do, but by establishing and ensuring that individual parts of a society flourish and thrive, which is one of the concepts enshrined in the whole idea of a charity.<br><br>
This is another area where there is another growing issue of principle, where the Socilists claim that in some way there is some great general will which surpasses the individual good within a society.<br><br>
The Conservatives argue that society is made up of individual parts, one of which is a charity. We are at issue on this matter. It is a philosophical point that has been debated timelessly down the ages. This general issue of principle between the parties is the second reason why we are unlikely to persuade the Minister of State. The Socialists do not like charities.<br><br>
The third and more specific reason is the one to which I have already alluded—namely, that I suspect that there is growing trade union pressure upon the Socialist Government to be immensely sceptical and to register the feeling of being threatened by charities. I have seen it in a number of cases in discussions with constituents—for example, on the role of the WRVS. There is a clear feeling that the trade unions are beginning to exert pressure upon the Labour Party, for reasons best known to themselves, and for obvious reasons such as their wage bargaining position which may be threatened by charities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the reasoning is obvious, as my hon. Friend says. The unions, as the Government persistently fail to recognise, are there to further the interests of their members and their members only, and they have persistently failed to display any interest in the welfare of people who are not their members.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0975">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 757</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an extremely interesting point. It is a great paradox in the Socialists' position that in debates on this Bill they always speak of "the community", where as as has been rightly and well-stated by my hon. Friend, when it comes to the trade unions, the whole concept of "the community" is thrown out of the window. The Government bow to the will of a small but powerful section of the community.<br><br>
I believe that the unions and union pressure is the third reason why the Minister is unlikely to give way on the subject of charities.<br><br>
12 noon.<br><br>
There is perhaps a fourth reason to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hove alluded—namely, the fear which always dominates Socialist legislation that there might somewhere be imbedded, hidden from public eye, some tax loophole. My hon. Friend the Member for Hove dealt with that point extremely well. The Opposition's objective is not to create tax loopholes. If that is a fear, I am sure that the Government would have the support of this side—the Treasury is rather good at these matters, anyway—in writing into the legislation safeguards against this kind of anti-avoidance measure. It is not the objective of this amendment, as I understand it, to create tax loopholes.<br><br>
Although that may be one of the bases of the Minister's argument, it should not be one that should distract us for too long. I suspect that he will argue, as he did on the question of pensions yesterday, in his usual charming and well-informed way, but on the basis of principle. But it is our duty on this side to make sure that it is recognised by the public, that on the question of charities there is an issue of principle.<br><br>
As has been mentioned, this is the first piece of tax legislation in which charities have been consciously included for tax purposes. For the reasons I have given, and because there is a growing feeling within the Socialist Party that charities are proving a threat to the general, centrally-organised plans which it has in mind for our society, that charities are messy, that they threaten the overall monopoly of the public sector, I believe that increasingly we shall find that charities will be hit. I believe, therefore, that this must be viewed as the thin end of the wedge.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 758</span>
As long as everybody outside is clear that the Socialist Party dislikes charities and that we shall see from now on increasingly swingeing legislation against them; as long as it is realised that we on this side not only like charities but approve of everything they stand for, their whole philosophy, their basic motivating force, at least the public debate will be an informed one.<br><br>
I therefore strongly support this amendment, although recognising that we are unlikely to win the day.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a brief contribution on the role of the Church and, in particular, in its provision of schools. This has been an important task of the Church over many years and, in particular, the Principality of Wales has benefited enormously from the provision of Church schools.<br><br>
There can be no doubt that the future of voluntary schools is threatened by the Bill. It is not an immediate threat, because the land that the Churches now hold they held, presumably, on White Paper day. But as the years go by there can be no doubt that less and less of the land that will be held by the Church for the charitable use of the provision of voluntary schools will be land which was held on White Paper day. Therefore, there is a threat to the contribution that the Church has made in education.<br><br>
One has only to look at any urban situation—I take my city of Cardiff as an example—to realise that the Church was able to continue to make its contribution over the last two decades only because it was able to sell lands which are no longer required for educational purposes in the centre of the city, and to develop new schools in the developing suburbs where the population has shifted.<br><br>
It has always been envisaged that the Church would be able to continue its role in education, and now this is threatened. No one should underestimate the enormous contribution to the community that is being made by the Church in its provision of schools. Special mention could be made of the Roman Catholic schools.<br><br>
I should like to quote from a letter I received this morning from the Bishop of the Diocese of St. Davids, who will be familiar to the Minister of State, as his constituency of Llanelli comes into that diocese. The Bishop makes this point,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0976">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 759</span>
which I am sure the Minister will realise is absolutely valid:
<br><blockquote><p>"First it seems to us"—</p></blockquote>
he speaks, of course, for the Council for Education for the Diocese of St. Davids—
<br><blockquote><p>"to fail to recognise that the financial resources of charities are deployed in the interests of the community at large no less than are the financial resources of Local Authorities."</p></blockquote>
The point that I should like to stress is made by the Bishop in his next sentence:—
<br><blockquote><p>"A voluntary school in other words is as much provision for the community as is a County school…"</p></blockquote>
The Minister must be familiar with many examples in villages in Wales where the only school, the only provision for primary education, is, in fact, a Church school. I can think of one very close to where I live in the village of Pendoylan.<br><br>
So it is the responsibility of the Committee to recognise the contribution being made to the community by a voluntary school. That contribution is every bit as good as the contribution made by a local authority school. I therefore support the amendment and ask the Committee to look to the long-term interests of the voluntary schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had another interesting and long debate. This is as important a subject as that of pensions. Perhaps at the end of the day, as the hon. Gentleman says, there will be a gulf between us, though not for the reasons he alluded to.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) made one or two points which were interesting in terms of the argument that I adduced. In the course of his speech, he touched upon some of the difficulties, in saying, "What will happen if we give these exemptions to charities? They may engage in property development". I was not going to use that argument, but since he raised the point I think it a good one.<br><br>
Charities may well go into the field of property development if we create a land market to pay for the situation, where all other organisations have to pay 80 per cent., and these worth bodies—the charities—will be tax-free. The hon. Gentleman could see, with his experience in such matters, that there might be a movement for charitis—not the Bishop of London, but for charities generally, to move into this field and become very
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 760</span>
large property developers in their own right. I have no doubt that it would not then be the trade unions coming here and complaining, but some of the hon. Gentleman's friends, like Capital and Counties, Legal and General, and many of those concerned with the City of London, whose business it is to develop property and who would be very angry indeed if they were paying 80 per cent., whereas the charities —going back to the dissolution of the monasteries—would be getting exemptions.<br><br>
I do not rest on that argument, but merely take it up from what the hon. Gentleman said, as a possibility. But if one creates a beneficial exemption for one group, although it may be fair for that group, it would be unfair for other organisations, especially those whose business it is to carry out this kind of work. I could not let that point go without any comment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the same argument apply to all those authorities set out in the clause? Could they not embark on property development—even those local authorities such as the Commission for the New Towns and so on. If the hon. Gentleman seeks to apply that argument, what protection will the public have against property transactions by those bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The protection the public get in relation to transactions by those bodies is that, by and large, they are more democratic than some of the other bodies that engage in proporty transactions. They may not be very democratic. I do not want to stand here and say that the local authorities are always extremely democratic bodies—neither is the House of Commons for that matter—but at least they tend to be more democratic than many other bodies that carry out development for the benefit of shareholders or pension holders and others.<br><br>
The second point raised by the hon. Gentleman was a good one. He said that there might be problems and loopholes and that charities would go into this field and use this kind of exemption. But, he said, the Treasury would make good that sort of thing and ensure that there would not be any tax avoidance. But this is not tax avoidance; this is tax exemption, and it is tax exemption for charities.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0977">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 761</span>
I come back to the point raised by the right hon. Gentleman. I do not agree that the definitions are all right and to keep the charities as they are. We have a very wide definition of charities, as he will recognise the definition of charities goes back a very long way, though we have been unable to find—the right hon. Gentleman says it is not desirable to find it, and that is an argument—and I suspect successive Governments will be unable to find, a more satisfactory definition. But, as the right hon. Gentleman recognises, it is a very wide definition covering a vast range of cases, and to say "Let us bring charities in but let us guarantee against loopholes, as it is very very easy to draft legislation" is, with respect, not right. It is so difficult to differentiate between one charity and another, because "charity" is such a wide word and covers such a wide range of bodies. Therefore, that argument will not hold in this case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister agree, then, that provision to prevent exemption from being allowed when it should not be allowed is no more difficult than dealing with detail in another form of taxation. I think that up to now there has been a tidy exemption tax and I suggest that he considers a provision, for example, to secure that any initial development, as distinct from redevelopment, of charitable holding should be exempt only if it is subsequently used either for the enjoyment or the actual purposes of the charity for a minimum period of 10 years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is coming to the present provisions of the Bill. As he knows, in Clauses 23 and 24 we have sought in fact to give these exemptions where property is developed for the charity's own use, and the charity's own use is defined narrowly—perhaps too narrowly for this purpose—in Clause 24. We have tried there to give an exemption where a charity develops. I have raised the point about old people's homes, day centres and all the other worthy cases that he mentioned, because they will not be caught within the legislation. It affects only commercial development. I accept that in some cases commercial development would fund the other development. It is only commercial development in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 762</span>
relation to post-White Paper day land—not pre-White Paper day land—that would be caught.<br><br>
I do not want to make too much of my first point, but there is a problem in relation to charities. Charities are not just churches. They are a vast range of organisations, accepted, no doubt, by the Home Office, the Charity Commissioners or whichever Department decides these matters. The definition is extremely wide. It means, not only religion, science and education but public purposes in general, as far as I can see from the old cases on the old legislation. We are therefore talking about a wide range of bodies—not just churches or women's institutes, but a complete range of bodies, some of which, of course, were set up as private individuals for, possibly, worthy purposes.<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman said that we were in fact hitting at the voluntary organisations. Most voluntary organisations, unfortunately, probably do not sit on development land. I cannot imagine Save the Children Fund or one of these charitable bodies owning a large chunk of land for development value. Most charitable organisations either pay rent or are given the use of property. They are not in a position to realise vast development value. So we are talking here in the main about churches, and perhaps colleges and various education establishments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Surely the hon. Gentleman cannot seriously be advancing that argument. He must know that many of the older charities, particularly those involved in housing in London, have substantial areas of property which they wish to redevelop in the coming years. That is well known.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If they are older charities they will be catered for in the Bill. If they owned the land on 12th September 1974, as most of these cases would, then we cater for them.<br><br>
But we are covering a vast range of voluntary organisations. Of all the charities in this country most of them, I should have thought, do not hold valuable chunks of development land. I am not putting that forward as an argument for saying that we should not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0978">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 763</span>
accept the amendment, but I do not want the impression to go outside the Committee that we are hitting at every voluntary charitable organisation. We are concerned here with a minority of charitable organisations—albeit an important minority—owning land which might have development value, and because of the exemptions they are concerned about land acquired after 12th September 1974.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Minister does not want the impression to go out from the Committee that he is hitting at everybody, but, in fact, there is nothing in the legislation to substantiate that. In principle everybody is hit. Obviously one accepts that only certain bodies will actually own development land but the point is that this legislation hits at all charities. There is nothing in the legislation to discriminate against different sources. If he is worried about the wrong impression getting out, he should be worried. Not only is it the impression, but it is the fact that should get outside.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Everybody who owns development land is hit. Everybody who does not own development land is not. The point I am making is that most voluntary organisations do not own development land.<br><br>
When the right hon. Gentleman advanced his argument, in the main he concentrated on churches and for a very good reason. He mentioned Worthing Rugby Football Club. Coming from the constituency that I do, I did not think that that was a particularly hard case. Perhaps the Cardiff Rugby Football Club would be treated even less sympathetically. Then we have the lower end of Sutton High Street, which is also no doubt a case which has attracted his attention, but in the main he dealt with churches, subject to the educational side. There may be some cases—All Souls College may have some difficulty with its development plans—but, in the main, it is the churches —and for a very good reason, as I said in discussion of a previous amendment—that would be likely to be affected if the legislation had gone through in the original form or if the original concession had not been made as a result of representations made by the Churches Main Committee. They would have been mainly
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 764</span>
affected for the very good reason that they, more than any other charity as far as I can see, are dependent on their land to carry out fully their charitable purposes. As a result of those representations we said "Yes, this is a fair point. In respect of all land that you owned before White Paper day, you will not bear any of this DLT when you sell or redevelop." That was the first concession made, and it was made for the very reason that the hon. Member for Cardiff, North-West (Mr. Roberts) gave when he said "They may move out into the suburbs." Indeed, if they move into the suburbs now they are not caught at all by this legislation.<br><br>
I noticed that the hon. Gentleman said "Long-term—50, 60 years, 100 years." Of course it may be that in another 70, 80, 90 years when they move out again, when those suburbs become decripit and rundown, they will want to move somewhere else and perhaps, if this legislation goes on the statute book—I am rather confident, as the hon. Gentleman implied that it will be on the statute book in 70 or 80 years' time—they will have a problem. It is a long-term problem anyway, if there is one, but I do not think that in the long-term there will be a problem because people in just these circumstances will have taken into account legal obligations and liabilities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The churches have no intention of waiting 70 years before putting up new schools in newly developing suburbs. This is a process going on year by year, and there is no point in the Minister talking of 70 years' time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In that case they are all right. They are developing for their own use. We are not saying that we shall impose the tax in those circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Roberts</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The schools are paid for by selling land which is no longer required for educational purposes in the decaying centres of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The land which landlords will sell now in the decaying centres of the city to pay for those new schools would mostly be pre-White Paper day land. It is the next sale in the next decaying suburb that would be caught. We moved from
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0979">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 765</span>
the city centre into the suburbs. That was all right. It is the next move from the suburbs when they decay to yet another suburb, or possibly back to the city centre which, as the legislation is drawn, would be caught. It is the second remove. That is why the hon. Gentleman said 70, 80 or 100 years and why the right hon. Gentleman referred to the long term.<br><br>
There may be a problem on a second move. I am merely putting it in perspective. It is a long-term problem and no doubt it is a long-term difficulty. People adjust. Investment decisions and arrangements are adjusted to take into account particular forms of legislation.<br><br>
We are not concerned here with the immediate future. The representations that have been made have not been to the effect that this is a short-term problem. They have been to the effect that they are afraid that their present pattern of financing church schools, of financing churches and other establishments, will be damaged in the long term because of this legislation. However, their pattern of financing might change as time goes by because of the nature of this legislation.<br><br>
Another reason we chose 13th September 1974 was touched upon by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) in an example he gave. He said that most of these foundations acquired land through bequests, but that perhaps in the future because of this legislation they would receive their bequests in a different form. The reason we decided on the White Paper day exemption was that so many people give land to charities and churches in those circumstances, in many cases fully conscious of the taxation provisions—or lack of them—at that time. We thought that it would not be fair to make the legislation retrospective, in the sense that a person may have given land to a charity in the belief—correctly at that time—that the development of that land would not be subjected to tax, because it was a charity. We thought it only right to fix a date so that all past bequests would not be caught, because the donor's intention was to give to a charity that did not involve any tax.<br><br>
No doubt donors will take into account all these factors, and perhaps something other than land will be given. I do not know. We made the date for tax 13th September 1974, not for purely arbitrary reasons, but the reasons I have stated. We did not want to put the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 766</span>
churches into any difficulty in relation to the move they make, or may have to make, out of our city centres.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to clubs. He gave the example of the Worthing Rugby Football Club. The Committee will not be surprised to hear that I have had correspondence from clubs as well. Sporting clubs are not generally charitable bodies. It may be that this is a gap in the definition of "charity". The definition is drawn from a statute of Elizabeth hundreds of years ago when perhaps sport was not considered to be a charity.<br><br>
We may have to look for another definition one of these days. In the main, however, sporting clubs are not charities and they would not be covered by this amendment even if it were accepted. The amendment seeks to exempt charities, and does not affect sporting clubs. The right hon. Gentleman said that roll-over relief might help them, and no doubt we shall hear more about that as we proceed.<br><br>
One reason why we have not included roll-over relief in this legislation, and the reason we have a 66⅔ per cent. tranche, is that we think that in many cases it will fulfil the function fulfilled by roll-over relief, without complicating the legislation as much as roll-over relief would have done. I repeat that sporting clubs are not charities and would not be covered by the amendment.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman asked a specific question in relation to a charitable body. He asked if a small village charity would get the £10,000 exemption and if the Church of England or Methodist Church or some other charitable body on a larger scale would receive the same £10,000 exemption. The answer is "Yes, it is £10,000 for each single body". It may be that some large charities operate in separate parts as single bodies within the legislation. If they are single bodies, each single body receives the £10,000 exemption. I will not go further, be cause I do not know how many of these charities are drawn up. The answer to his question is that a single body—whatever a single body may mean in the circumstances—gets the £10,000 exemption.<br><br>
The problem is the same with a single individual receiving the £10,000 exemption, and the large property company having the same exemption. It may be said to be unfair, but a single individual could make a much larger profit than a property
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0980">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 767</span>
company on a particular transaction. In the same way, a small local charity might make a larger profit than the large charity. The answer to his question is "Yes, £10,000 for each body."<br><br>
I should make clear what the exemptions are covered by the provisions of Clauses 23 and 24. As I said, all land held at 12th September 1974 will not be subjected to legislation in any shape or form. Land left to a charity under a will of a deceased person who died before 12th September 1974, when the administration of the estate had not been completed, will be treated as land held on 12th September 1974.<br><br>
We can return to that matter when we come to the clause. The fact that there has not been a vesting or completion of the administration of the estate will not deny the charity from that exemption.<br><br>
I come to land acquired by one charity from another. If the other charity held the land on 12th September 1974 and there was no break in the charity chain, that also comes within the exemption.<br><br>
I come to post-White Paper day land. This, as I said, is land used by charities for their own purposes. I do not include commercial purposes to receive rents, but land for an old people's home or a school for their own charitable purposes. Such land would also be exempt under this legislation. It is only the commercial development on post-White Paper day land that would be caught by this legislation in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does that exemption apply to the commercial content of a mixed development?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If it is a mixed development of offices in order to receive an income and an old people's home for a strictly charitable purpose, the old people's home is all right, but the offices part is not.<br><br>
We have gone a long way to assist charities. We have recognised in the legislation that they are in a special position. We do not think the legislation will harm them in the short or medium term. There may be some problems in the long term but we believe that they will adjust to those in the way that people adjust to changes in legislation. The form of legislation we have provided is fair and just. It recognises the importance of charities in society and the good work
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 768</span>
they do. We could not go further to give a complete exemption for ever to all charities for development land.</span></p>
<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure the Committee is very grateful to the Minister for the explanation which he has given of the Governments case, which shows barely and crudely the attack which is being made on charities and charitable institutions which go under the name of charities, such as churches and other bodies we have been discussing.<br><br>
We had talk previously of the mandarins of Middlesbrough in the Palace of Titipu. I think we have not reached the Tudor Court and we have before us Henry VIII himself and the dissolution of the monasteries. I cannot say that the hon. Gentleman exactly looks like the monarch. Indeed, I think there are some remarks in Shakespeare's "Henry VIII" about the girth of the stomach, and perhaps the hon. Gentleman will throw this back at me.<br><br>
Certainly this is an attack on the assets of the present churches which is only comparable to the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII. It is really taking away the assets on which they are carrying out their charitable purposes. Probably in those days of Henry VIII they were not doing their job very well and there was some justification for depriving them of their assets. However, the Minister has not suggested that except to say that in some cases charities are not charities and that we ought to re-define them and eliminate a number of them.<br><br>
He followed up the points put by my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), that charities may go into the business of property development. Will they not then be trading? Will they not then be dealing in property? Will they not then be caught, or could be caught under other tax provisions, in the same way as any other individual who goes out deliverately to trade in property? To say that because the holes cannot be stopped up, we shall bash the lot of them with this tax, is really an admission of defeat. But it is an admission of defeat by the Minister, stated on behalf of those brilliant people, the poorly draftsmen. I am quite sure that they will not raise an objection that one cannot stop up these holes, or prevent by proper provisions a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0981">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 769</span>
disabuse of the benefits which ought to be given to charities under the Bill. It sounds more like the good lady who was given a material to stop up the mouse holes. She said she could not do so and would have to catch the mice first. But it is a poor argument to say that the loopholes cannot be closed because of the drafting difficulties.<br><br>
The Minister said they were dealing here with a vast range of organisations, and that therefore it is difficult to prevent improper advantage being taken of an exemption of this sort. We are dealing with a vast range of organisations, and they do not all hold development land. If the Government are still in office when, for example, an Abbeyfield sells off some of its property in order, perhaps, to build bigger homes, and if that property was not purchased before 12th September 1974, there will be a massive outcry from the public. What about the same situation with Cheshire Homes, with Dr. Barnardo's and some of the well known charities which rely on some of their property for income? What happens with the charities of the church orders, the convents, which are engaged by the local authorities to relieve them of some of their duties for the care of children?<br><br>
In my constituency there is a convent which looks after children in local authority care, and is paid by it for doing so. The order owns a considerable amount of property, and relies on that ownership of some of its income. It will be less able to carry out its duties, yet local authorities rely on it to do those duties.<br><br>
At the other extreme, what about the RSPCA? The RSPCA in my constituency sold its land because it wanted a larger area. It may be that it sold pre-September 1974 land and bought other land for the purpose of the charity. If that is so, it may have escaped the tax, but that situation will not last for ever. That charity, as other charities, will have bought land since September 1974.<br><br>
In all the cases which I am quoting, the charities are helping local authorities. The RSPCA is paid by the Police authority to look after stray dogs so that the local authority or the police do not have to look after them. Therefore, these charities—whether Abbeyfield, the Cheshire Homes, Dr. Barnardo's, or the convents, which look after children in the care of the local authority, or the RSPCA
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 770</span>
—are doing exactly the same duties as local authorities. They are being paid by the local authorities to do those duties.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hove, used the example of the John Marshall Trust which provides charitable services. A number of such trusts come to mind. The Harper Trust in Bedford, which owned the Bedford School in the middle of Bedford, has sold that property for redevelopment and has now built the school outside Bedford. For the purposes of the Bill it owned that property before September 1974 and if the transaction had taken place today it would have escaped the tax. But that would have been pure luck.<br><br>
There are many occasions where, perhaps through changing circumstances or a better endowment, a charity will have purchased property quite recently after September 1974. If it wishes to change its ideas about the development of the property and to move its development activities to some other area, it will be caught by the tax. Charities will be hamstrung by not being able to manage their affairs so as best to carry out their charitable aims.<br><br>
We are not dealing with a small minority of charities. The Minister said that most voluntary organisations do not sit on development land and that we are only dealing with a minority of charities who hold land which can be developed. I do not know whether that is a minority in number or a minority in the services which they provide. But some of those which provide the most important charitable services, which are relied upon both by central Government and local government are those which rely on their holding of land to carry out their charitable purposes.<br><br>
He said that I had used the argument mainly from the point of view of the churches, that they were most likely to be affected. This concerns not only the churches, and not only moves from the city centres to the suburbs involving the sale of pre-1974 property. It is not so very long-term. It is all very well to use figures like 70, 80 or 90 years ahead, and that it will only worry people then. I trust that the Act will not worry anybody then, because this Government will be out of office and we shall have revised the tax considerably. Certainly we shall have removed charities from the effects of the Act.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0982">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 771</span>
Therefore, it is not only a long-term problem. More than a minority of charitable purposes will be affected. It is a very wide attack on those who are providing public benefits which would otherwise have to be provided by central or local government.<br><br>
I turn now to a point on which I asked a specific question: who is the individual in the case of the charity? I suggest that the Minister should resign immediately and return to the Tax Bar, because there will be a tremendous amount of work for him, and for me, in dividing up the Church of England into a charity for every church and every voluntary school, so that all can obtain the £10,000 exemption.<br><br>
This shows how little this attack on charities has been considered, because the provision will have an utterly unfair impact on charities throughout the country. Just because one charity chooses to manage its concerns by one large corporation, and others through small bodies, grave unfairness will result between one charity and another. We need consider only the</span></p>

<br><blockquote><p>'(<i>j</i>) a builder or developer of residential or industrial property (as defined in the</p></blockquote></span></p>

<p>difference between the Church of England and the Methodist church on the holding of property to realise that. In the first case it is held for the whole country by one corporation, the Church Commissioners. In the other case every area is its own authority.</p>
<p>I recollect this matter coming up in the course of the Charities Act 1960 and similar legislation. I should have thought that at least this aspect might have been thought out and worked out before embodying the provision in the Bill that charities shall be subject to the tax. I am sure that my hon. Friends feel as I do that we have had a totally unsatisfactory answer. I do not mean explanation. The hon. Gentleman explained the Government's case fully. But that case is so unsatisfactory to us that I ask my hon. Friends to divide on the matter.</p>
<p><i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made;—</p>
<p><i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>

<p>Having dealt with the important questions of pension funds and charities, we turn now to another important matter,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0983">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 773</span>
though perhaps not one so immensely sensitive as that of pensions funds and charities. This is the question of the building industry itself, which after all produces the houses in which people have to live. I redeclare, so to speak, the interest which I have declared on a number of occasions, as I always do when I specifically urge on the Committee something connected with the building industry. I am of course a director of a house-building company.</p>
<p>Basically, the amendment seeks to add to the list of authorities exempted under Clause 11 from development land tax
<br><blockquote><p>"a builder or developer of residential or industrial property"</p></blockquote>
at the time of their realising development value or being deemed to realise it at the commencement of a project of material development. We have to some extent covered this ground before and I do not intend to develop the argument at great length, as I have already clone so previously</p>
<p>I should like first to draw to the attention of the Committee exactly what the definition of "builder or developer" is as referred to in the Community Land (Excepted Development) Regulations. In what I will call paragraph 2 of those regulations—my right hon. Friend, who is the greatest expert on statutory instruments, will probably say that it is Regulation 2:
<br><blockquote><p>"builder or developer of residential or industrial property "</p></blockquote>
is defined as
<br><blockquote><p>"any person carrying on a business which—
<ol>
<li>consists wholly or mainly of the carrying out of building operations or of building and engineering operations and includes the building of dwelling-houses or industrial buildings, or</li>
<li>consists wholly or mainly of building, or arranging for the building of, dwelling-houses or industrial buildings, and of selling, feuing or letting them".</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></p>
<p>I understand that the term "feuing" relates to Scotland, and I will say no more about that.</p>
<p>That is the definition that we are commending to the Committee. It is a reasonably wide one, as it includes developers as well as builders, in that it refers to arranging for them to be built—that is, a developer who is not also an employer of building trade labour but who uses contractors to carry out his work for him. But in every case it is concerned with somebody who is actually
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 774</span>
involved with the production of houses or industrial property. That is a clear and specific definition taken from a recent Ministerial regulation.</p>
<p>That is the matter in fact. I turn now to my arguments as to why the amendment should be supported. First, I should like to draw to the attention of the Committee, as I have done on previous occasions, the fact that I and other members of the Opposition have on a number of occasions during the proceedings on the Bill drawn a clear distinction between a land vendor, or indeed a builder if he were to be acting as a land vendor—that is, simply selling on land—and a builder engaged in the development of his stock-in-trade. Indeed, it was argued by my hon. Friend the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Raison) on behalf of the Opposition on 15th March 1976 when he said this:
<br><blockquote><p>"Is it right in any case that there should be a special tax on those who are in the full-time business of developing and building? After all, their position is different from that of those who make what my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) called windfall gains on land. There is a strong case for treating them under the ordinary company tax provisions, because the increase in land value which is being taxed is not for them just a matter of good luck; it is the result of the constant operation of their professional skill. They have to work at the business of increasing the value of land—it does not just come out of thin air—and theirs is a special position which must be acknowledged." [OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 963.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>In the same debate on 15th March I said:
<br><blockquote><p>"the rate of taxation on planning gains by land vendors should be 60 per cent. of it … For builders, whose land is their stock in trade, the tax should be at corporation tax rates."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 5th March 1976; Vol. 907, c. 1010.]</p></blockquote></p>
<p>I am not suggesting, nor do we advocate in this amendment, that it would be wrong for builders to pay any tax. Of course they should. I have said that, where a builder acts as a land vendor, where he buys land, say, from another builder or from a vendor, and then sells it again, having clone nothing to it in between but is acting purely as a vendor, he should certainly pay development land tax at whatever rate the Government fix in the Statute. But where he is acting in regard to his stock in trade, I believe a totally different situation arises. Of course, the Government accept that, because Clause 16 grants special exemptions for land held in stock in trade on White Paper day.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0984">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 775</span>
We shall be talking more about that when we get there.</p>
<p>I know that the Government attach great importance to the housing programme. I have often been critical of many of the specific policies for the housing programme, but that is part of parliamentary debate. But on a number of occasions, during proceedings on the Committee stage of the Community Land Bill, I said that I am sure that Ministers want to see the highest production of houses. The Minister of Planning and Local Government and others have made it clear that that is so. So there is no distinction between both sides of the Committee.</p>
<p>The Treasury Ministers here this morning and my right hon. and hon. Friends are united in wanting to see the maximum possible production of houses, in accordance with market forces, in the private sector. There is no dispute about that and, at present, the situation is slightly better than it was last year, let alone the year before that.</p>
<p>The question arises, therefore, of the forward confidence of builders. I have said previously that I am disturbed about the likely flow of land in the next few years as a result of this Bill, although that is not directly germane to the amendment. However, I will say that, if this amendment were to be accepted as we put it now, it would not exclude from development land tax the land dealer; it would not exclude from development land tax the builder acting as land dealer. But it would say that, where the builder is acting as builder, where he has bought some land from a vendor, he has planning permission and has made the deemed disposal—he has dug the trench—then tax should be payable, not at development land tax rates, but at corporation tax rates as it would normally be in accordance with existing taxation procedure. It would draw a distinction which has been drawn in previous statutes between the builder as a builder, and the land developer, or the simple vendor of land.</p>
<p>I think I am right in saying that every statute since the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, and including that Act, has contained a special provision such as Clause 16 to deal with builders' stock-in-trade.</p>
<p>So, whereas we obviously welcome Clause 16 in principle, I think that at this stage an amendment of this kind would
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 776</span>
do a great deal to restore the confidence of the building industry which is not at a very high level, although the situation is slightly better than it was a couple of years ago.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) wants to add to the list of authorities in this clause the builder who builds as his main occupation or interest.<br><br>
I understand the reason the hon. Gentleman has tabled the amendment. As he rightly indicated, the effect of this amendment would be that the exemption from development land tax would extend to the builder or developer of residential or industrial property. As he stated in his opening remarks, we have been over this before on an earlier amendment, but there is one change here, of course, in that we are now adding industrial property to the residential property, which I believe, was the subject of a similar and earlier amendment.<br><br>
I should say at the outset that the difficulty here is that if one includes the builder in these categories one gives to the builder or developer the advantage of not being chargeable on his development gains, and windfall profits can arise to a developer or builder of industrial or residential property, every bit as much as to the private individual. The hon. Gentleman makes the point that, after all, the builder's gains are in some way associated with the business which he is carrying out. But there are other areas of taxation where we find it necessary not to rely alone on the corporation tax, which, of course, is the big mopper up of liability on all profits enjoyed in the course of one's business activities. We have, of course, the petroleum revenue tax which similarly puts a very high taxation rate upon the proceeds of petroleum and oil extraction.<br><br>
Development land tax is another tax of a similar kind where a specific rate of tax is devised for what may be the complete operation in the case of an individual owning land but which may be only part of the operation of the builder or developer. This, I maintain, is strictly analogous to the other example of taxation which is, in general, accepted as being suitable in the case of petroleum revenue.<br><br>
Therefore, I do not think that one can accept the clear distinction drawn by the hon. Gentleman. Of course he is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0985">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 777</span>
right to say that it is the task of the builder or developer to make money out of building and the development of land. Of course it is right that corporation tax rates shall apply to that activity. But where one developer or builder is in a position that is advantageous in comparison with that of another builder or developer—not through any particular skills of his own, not through any insight into customers' requirements, but purely because of advantages created by the community—he is in a strictly comparable situation with that of the individual who can make a gain in precisely the same way. It is right therefore, that development land tax as regards this part of his operations should apply in the same way to him as it does to the private individual.<br><br>
We have taken account of the special needs of the developer and of the builder arising from the nature of the operations that they conduct, and, of course, we have the eight-year spreading arrangement for the payment of tax. We have taken account of the problems of the builder;
