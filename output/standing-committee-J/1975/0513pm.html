	<p>4.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 215, in page 51, line 43, leave out 'section 80 or section 82' and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'sections 80, 81 or 82'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 274, in Schedule 6, page 107, line 38, leave out 'section 80 or section 82' and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'sections 80, 81 or 82'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now come to a deceptively bland clause which introduces the interaction of development land tax with other taxes. It occupies a page and a half of the Bill, and on it hangs the whole of Schedule 6. Therefore, in discussing the amendments to the clause we should bear in mind that there may be points which need to be followed through in Schedule 6, and, as in this case, there may be a consequential amendment in Schedule 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment relates to the introductory arrangements for the interaction of taxes, as set out in subsection (1). It deals with situations in which development land tax falls to be charged on realisation of development value, which is also brought into account for the purposes of certain other taxes. Those taxes include chargeable gains, tax on profits or gains of a trade, estate duty, capital transfer tax, and then in paragraph (	<i>e</i>):
	<br><blockquote><p>"section 80 or section 82 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970",</p></blockquote>
where certain sums which may appear to be received as capital are taxed as rent and, therefore, as income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of Section 80, if a lease is granted as a premium, part of the premium may be taxed as income, and the purpose of including Section 80 is to provide the proper relief. Section 81 relates to a case where there is not a premium, but there
	<span class='label label-info column'>1216</span>
may be an assignment. Under the Bill as drafted, there appears to be no provision for relief to the income tax which may be charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Government will accept this amendment or produce something similar. As they included Sections 80 and 82, I am worried, because the Government must have looked at Section 81 and decided not to put it in. I hope that that is an accidental omission, and I shall be glad to hear the Minister's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment seeks to include Section 81 as one of the provisions for which interaction relief can be allowed for development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 81 is an anti-avoidance section. So are Sections 80 and 82, although Section 81 is aimed at a transaction in many ways even more artificial than would be the case under Section 80 or Section 82.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 81 is aimed at avoidance of tax by granting a lease for a high premium and a sub-standard rent. The premium would be subject to capital gains tax while the rent would be liable to income tax or corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 gives interaction relief where part of a premium on the grant of a lease is charged as income, under Section 80, or where an amount is chargeable as income on a sale with a right to reconveyance—Section 82. It does not allow relief, as the hon. Gentleman has said, where there is an income charge under Section 81. These amendments seek to fill that gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In logic, possibly one could argue, as the hon. Gentleman has argued, that once relief is given for Section 80 and Section 82, there is no reason why relief should not be given for Section 81. But Section 81 is aimed at even more artificial transactions than either Section 80 or Section 82 and, although representations have been made to us that even a Section 81 situation could be genuine, the bodies which made these representations have been unable to come up with any situation which was genuine and would be taxed under Section 81 and denied relief because of the exclusion of Section 81 from the interaction relief provisions of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it appears illogical on the face of it, and although we are dealing with anti-avoidance provisions, it could fairly be said that if a person enters into
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1223">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1217</span>
an anti-avoidance transaction and gets his fingers burnt, why should we give him relief for development land tax. That is one view. On the other hand, it could be said that we give him some relief for Section 80 and Section 82 anyway, why not go all the way. Without making a commitment on whether relief shall be extended to Section 81, and without accepting the amendment, I am prepared to consider the matter. I want to think about whether some genuine transactions would be caught.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. As with all our amendments, they are part probing and part straight. We have to establish first what the Government are trying to include or exclude and then see whether we feel that it is reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this case, as the Minister said, Section 81 is an anti-avoidance provision which relates to the charge on the assignment of leases granted at an under-value and the main purpose is to catch artificially constructed transactions. Without, admittedly, having practical examples which have come my way, I think that there could be genuine cases which might be caught. I am satisfied by the Minister's assurance that he will look at the matter again. We would not feel strongly about it if no 	<i>bona fide</i> examples could be produced. But the logic of the case remains and we are happy to let it rest on the Minister's word. Therefore I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

</ol></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are still dealing with subsection (1), dealing with the cases where interaction of development land tax with other taxes which are already on the statute book is being considered for the purposes of offset and relief and so on. Therefore, the addition of an extra item relating to Section 488 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act would bring into consideration another tax which is on the statute book but which, as the Bill stands, is not dealt with for the purposes of interaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 488 is a very wide ranging anti-avoidance section which applies wherever
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(	<i>a</i>) land, or any property deriving its value from land, is acquired with the sole or main object of realising the gain through disposing of the land, or</li>
	<li>(	<i>b</i>) land is held as trading stock, or</li>
	<li>(	<i>c</i>) land is developed with the sole or main object of realising a gain from disposing of the land when developed,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1224">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1219</span>
and any gain of a capital nature is obtained from the disposal of the land—
	<ol>
	<li>by the person acquiring, holding or developing the land, or by any connected person, or</li>
	<li>where any arrangement or scheme is effected as respects the land which enables a gain to be realised by any indirect method, or by any series of transactions, by any person who is a party to, or concerned in, the arrangement or scheme;</li>
</ol>
and this subsection applies whether any such person obtains the gain for himself or for any other person."</li>
</div> <!-- ul -->
I felt it right to quote that 	<i>in extenso</i> because it is necessary to see how wide ranging Section 488 is. It is clearly designed to catch cases where transactions have been set up in such a way among different parties, between a person and a company, and so on, with the idea of realising profit from developing land or other transactions in land which would not be caught directly by any specific taxes on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 488 has had considerable sway in recent years. It may not be fully appreciated by the Treasury how wide a sway that is, because many transactions which could potentially have been caught by Section 488 have never seen the light of day. I know from my many years' experience as a banker that many straightforward transactions which involved land have had to be reconsidered, sometimes shelved temporarily or even abandoned, because of the danger of a Section 488 assessment at income tax rates. Taken in conjunction with other taxation which might be levied on parts of the transaction in a different form, perhaps within a company—whereas the Section 488 assessment would apply to the individual—this assessment could produce such a high rate of tax in the ultimate that it would make the transaction uneconomic. Indeed, it could produce a rate of tax in excess of 100 per cent., because a high rate of personal tax coupled with other forms of taxation may produce no residual profit, or go beyond that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that there are in theory procedures whereby clearance can be obtained for 	<i>bona fide</i> transactions which might otherwise be caught by Section 488. But since inspectors are naturally reluctant to throw away all prospect of calling Section 488 in aid if at a later stage in the proceedings they might wish to make use of it, there is naturally a great reluctance on their part to give clearance in advance under Section 488. This is and has been a considerable disincentive to transactions,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1220</span>
many of which were designed for the avoidance or lessening of tax. In conjunction with that, many straightforward transactions have also been frustrated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that the whole reason behind Section 488 is that it is the intention of the Revenue that a very high rate of tax should be suffered by those who make substantial gains out of trading in or the development of land. That is what the development land tax is designed to do. Without that tax one can see the reason for Section 488, but with development land tax that case is very greatly reduced. Within a company, development land tax could be suffered at 66⅔ per cent., 80 per cent. and, eventually, 100 per cent. At the same time the shareholder in that company might pay tax on the same transaction at anything up to 83 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It does not seem logical to have a potential taxation of 183 per cent. because of the interaction of Section 488 and high individual tax rates. I am sure that, under the new circumstances of development land tax, Section 488 in its present form is unnecessary. If it is allowed to persist along with development land tax there will be cases where it will be almost impossible for the owner of property which might constitute development land to make any move at all. I am thinking of close property-owning companies, trusts, or certain cases relating to an individual. One wonders whether, in such cases, the ultimate owner of such land, interest in land, or shares in land-owning companies will ever be able to take any decisions for fear of taxation rates far in excess of 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We therefore feel that it is essential for the Bill to take into account the potential, not direct interaction of Section 488 and development land tax, but the interaction of the situation which could arise—perhaps in relation to personal tax under Section 488 and another within a company, or in the hands of another person at development land tax rate. The aggregate of the two could be an enormous figure. The whole question of Section 488 needs to be considered with the Bill, and I hope that this is the proper place for me to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments deal with Section 488 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970. The hon.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1225">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1221</span>
Gentleman has described the section quite correctly as the tax-avoidance section designed to catch not only transfer of land but transfers of property deriving its value from land. In talking of Section 488 we are concerned not only with land being transferred but shares in a land-owning company being transferred. It is important to remember that the section deals with both those situations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 488 is extremely wide because the intention was to stop people dressing up a trading transaction as a capital transaction. But, as I said, Section 488 deals with two kinds of situations—first, the transfer of land and, secondly, the transfer of shares. If land is transferred within a Section 488 situation the disposal of the interest in land would almost certainly, in most cases, be considered a development land tax disposal. There would almost certainly be some development value, and therefore development land tax would apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that in such a case relief would be given for the development land tax payable in computing the charge in respect of Section 488. The charge under Section 488 arises under Case VI of Schedule D. Section 488(6) provides for such method for computing the charge
	<br><blockquote><p>"as is just and reasonable in the circumstances."</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members may object to the wording of Section 488(6), but that is another argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My advice is that where there is a transfer of land which is subject both to Section 488 and to development land tax, the development land tax payable would be deductible under Section 488(6) because one could not possibly say that it was not just or reasonable to allow the deduction, otherwise there would be double taxation. On the first point, therefore—the transfer of land—the position is that the tax would be deductible in computing the Case VI charge under Schedule D.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Section 488 deals also with property deriving its value from land, which property would almost invariably be shares. A disposal of shares in a landowning company would not, of course, attract development land tax. It would attract liability under Section 488 if it were that kind of situation, but it would not in itself attract development land tax, as that is charged on the transfer of land, and there are no provisions, as far as I
	<span class='label label-info column'>1222</span>
am aware, to tax transfers of shares in a land-owning company. The charge, therefore, arises on the transfer of shares under Section 488.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The company may later dispose of the land, and may have to pay development land tax, but it would not be right to grant relief in those circumstances, because we are not comparing like with like. Indeed, the price paid for the shares in a land-owning company would almost invariably reflect the fact that the land in the company might be subjected to an 80 per cent. rate of development land tax. No one would buy shares in a landowning company where the land has a potential development land tax charge and pay a full price without taking into account that there might be a charge to tax when the land was sold by the company.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a different case. We should not give interaction relief in respect of development land tax, because we should be giving relief against the charge on transfer of land in respect of a charge on transfer of shares when in fact development land tax does not apply to the transfer of shares but only to the transfer of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that is a reasonably clear explanation. It may not satisfy hon. Members, but the situation is different from that of the previous amendment. This also is an anti-avoidance provision, but in the case of land I believe that the point is covered; in the case of transfer of shares I do not think that it would be either right or logical to give relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the Minister, I do not think that I can accept this as a reson for excluding the assessment under Section 488 from the list set out in Clause 33(1). Here we have, clearly, a list of items of taxation each of which refers to matters other than land, but when they refer to land there is an interaction process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Suppose that the mandarins of Middlesbrough—although, of course, they are just and reasonable—decide that they will not assess under any of the headings listed in the clause. There is the good old dustbin provision of Section 488, and they will assess under that. There is then no interaction between that and a charge for development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister divided the assessment under Section 488 into two classes. He
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1226">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1223</span>
said that where it dealt with land there would not be double taxation because the interaction would take place by some other means—but certainly not, I submit, under the list in subsection (1). It is far-fetched to say that it would not be assessed under Section 488 because that would not be just and reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that it is for the chargeable person to prove to the mandarins of Middlesbrough that it would not be just and reasonable to charge it. I have always thought it difficult for anyone to prove a negative. To be assessed and then told by the assessors "You prove that this is unjust and unreasonable" is a most underisable position for the chargeable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am inclined to agree with the Minister on his second class—the question of shares in the company owning land—but at the same time I do not think that because there may be tax chargeable under Section 488 in such cases that precludes the mention of Section 488 in subsection (1). There are listed there many other cases of taxation, such as estate duty, which may be charged on any sort of property, and capital transfer tax. Nothing will be lost to the Treasury by including Section 488 in the list, but everything may be lost to the chargeable person if it is not in the list. I ask the Minister to look again at this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept what the right hon. Gentleman says in regard to "just and reasonable". The position is that the DLT assessment would be made from Middlesbrough, and the Section 488 assessment would be made by the local inspector. If the vendor, or the transferor, of the land objected to that assessment he would object to his local inspector and no doubt appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I probably did not do justice to subsection (6) of Section 488 by merely picking out the words "just and reasonable". This is a long subsection which speaks of:
	<br><blockquote><p>"taking into account the value of what is obtained for disposing of the land, and allowing only such expenses as are attributable to the land".</p></blockquote>
The subsection continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and in applying this subsection—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) where a freehold is acquired and the reversion is retained … account may be taken of the way in which the profits or gains under Case I of Schedule D of a person dealing in land are computed in such a case".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1224</span>
The subsection then states that account may be taken of other adjustments. My point is that in almost every case the deduction of another tax would be allowed. There is authority for this in that deduction of another tax would be allowed in computing the tax under Case VI of Schedule D.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no problem. The present arrangements under Section 488 work reasonably well. I have not heard of any complaints or criticisms of this aspect of Case VI of Schedule D. I should have thought the taxpayer has plenty of protection in the provisions of subsection (6) of Section 488. I cannot, therefore, give a commitment to look into this matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not happy with what the Minister said. Naturally it is useful to have on record his comments about the way in which this might work in practice, and that the payment of development land tax would normally mean that an assessment to the same taxpayer would not be raised under Section 488.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The assessment could be raised, but the defence could be that a sum of tax had been paid and should be deducted in computing the liability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is right, but he did not say exactly that. He said that it would not, at the end of the day, be likely that Section 488 tax would be heaped on top of development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we have in the Bill very precise rules for the interaction of taxes. Any member of the Committee who has, as I have, ploughed through every word of Schedule 6 in an endeavour to understand what they mean, will marvel at the ingenuity of the parliamentary draftsmen, and those who planned the tax, and at what they have been able to include. At the appropriate stage we shall suggest that there are some matters which have not been included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not feel that the swingeing Section 488 provisions ought to be left without any mention in the Bill, on the tacit understanding that if all goes well, and if the taxpayer is able to resist an assessment, which as the Minister says may be raised, at the end of the day he will not have to pay tax on top of development

land tax, but that the payment of development land tax would be taken into account in any tax payable under Section 488.

5 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore not only believe that this is a matter of principle which we should press to a Division but hope that in so doing we may persuade the Minister, even though he has said that he is disinclined to reconsider this, to take into account the fact that Section 488 is a major disincentive to transactions. Of course, it is meant to be a major disincentive to 90 per cent. of the transactions which it hinders. But it should not be allowed to persist in tandem with development land tax.

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 264, in page 52, line 24, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'and any capital distribution within the meaning of Schedule 5 to the Finance Act 1975 including a capital distribution treated as made by virtue of any provision of that Schedule'.</p></blockquote>
Subsection (3) deals with the definitions of certain technical terms in Schedule 6. Paragraph (	<i>d</i>) provides that
	<br><blockquote><p>"a 'CTT transfer' means a transfer of value for the purposes of capital transfer tax,—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>(i) on the occasion of which an interest in land is acquired by any person "</li></div> <!-- ul --></p></blockquote>
and then goes on with other considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to deal with a case which could arise under certain kinds of settlements. For example, a transfer might take place after the termination of the interest of the settlor or of the settlor's spouse. The words "transfer of value" in line 19, taken with the requirement in subsection (3)(	<i>d</i>)(i) that a person is acquiring an interest in land, would exclude relief for CTT charges in the case of settlements where there was no beneficial interest in possession. We felt that that situation could be dealt with by the addition at the end of line 24 of the words of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1226</span>
	<p>accountants, asked to advise clients about transactions, have said that the very existence of Section 488 adds a degree of risk to what should not be a risky transaction, and that because the rates are so high, even though there is a 90 per cent. or 95 per cent. chance of getting away with it at the end of the day, it is not a risk which should be undertaken. That is in the case of taxes at lower rates. With taxes at 66⅔ per cent., 80 per cent. or 100 per cent., the problem is compounded. I therefore ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to support me in pressing the amendment to a Division.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 6, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment seeks to allow interaction relief in respect of capital transfer tax charged on a capital distribution out of a settlement. When property comes out of a settlement, as the hon. Gentleman explained, capital transfer tax can often be paid, and because of that, the transaction is treated as a capital distribution. The amendment seeks to allow development land tax relief in respect of that capital distribution and in respect of the capital transfer tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I can meet the hon. Gentleman. I was not clear whether he was concerned just with capital distributions in respect of an interest in land or whether he wanted us to go further and deal with capital distributions in respect of shares, where there is an indirect interest in land. I would not wish to go as far as that. There are other cases, too, where I would not wish to go that far.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the more limited point—which, I think, was what the hon. Gentleman had in mind in the amendment—where there is a capital distribution out of a trust in respect of an interest in land, he is quite right in thinking that there is no interaction relief at the moment, and I agree that there should be such provision. My only reservation concerns the drafting
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1228">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1227</span>
of the amendment. So, rather than accept the amendment I suggest that I accept its principle and that we put down an amendment on Report to deal with capital distributions out of a settlement in respect of an interest in land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to the Minister for what he has said. One is never quite confident of having these amendments absolutely right. The Minister has accepted entirely the intention of the amendment. There was no wish to apply it to transactions in shares relating to land. It relates to dierect interest in land. I am happy to accept the Minister's undertaking that the matter can be dealt with at a later stage. Therefore, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 425, in page 53, line 12, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7) Where any adjustment is made in the computation of the profits arising or losses incurred in an accounting period or year of assessment in giving effect to a deduction or other adjustment under this Act, a claim for relief or (as the case may be) for additional relief under any other provision of the Tax Acts which is made in consequence of that deduction or adjustment shall not be out of time if it is made before the end of the period of two years beginning with the date on which the deduction or adjustment is agreed or otherwise determined, notwithstanding that the time limit otherwise applicable to a claim under that provision has expired'.</p></blockquote>
The purpose here is to add a new subsection (7). There may be some provision elsewhere in the Bill which makes it unnecessary. It may be that this particular provision—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>5.26 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendment is self-evident from the wording, which explains our anxieties. In the Bill there are many provisions for adjustment, as a result of which there could be a retrospective Act which affects development land tax liability and could consequentially relate to income tax and corporation tax liability as well. This
	<span class='label label-info column'>1228</span>
could therefore result in consequential claims under the Taxes Acts being out of date for technical reasons—for example, claims under Sections 168 and 177 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that to meet this point the Bill should include some provision over-riding the time limit for claims similar to those contained in Section 18(8) of the Finance Act 1975, for otherwise the retrospective situations which occur throughout the Bill could bring unintentional problems in implementing the offsetting arrangements of the interaction of taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps this provision should occur elsewhere in the Bill. It may already be explicitly or implicitly provided in the Bill that such adjustments should not be out of time. If not, we consider this an extremely important point and hope that it will be accepted by the Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart), who has moved a sensible amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were concerned with the betterment levy some years ago, there were also detailed provisions in the Land Commission Act 1967 for the interaction of the levy with other forms of taxation. Elucidating any information about the interplay of taxes, namely what the yield was from betterment levy in real terms after the deduction of corporation tax and other forms of tax was difficult. It was never possible to get information from the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) will recall that at that time the Conservative Opposition argued that figures should be available showing what the net yield of betterment levy was after allowance had been made for corporation tax, and so on, which was not otherwise charged because these taxes were allowed to be offset against the betterment levy. No information was made available and perhaps it never could be made available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make this point and refer to these earlier examples because a similar situation exists here. We have a new tax on betterment, namely, on development land value, on which there are substantial arrangements offsetting against other forms of both corporate and personal taxation in the sense of capital gains tax and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1229">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1229</span>
capital transfer tax. The two-year offsetting period seems to be a modest one. I am in no way an expert on tax matters, but as I understand the position, under the existing tax statutes claims for setback and relief can be made up to six years in arrears in certain circumstances and the Revenue is prepared to look at those. When one is an individual sole trader or an individual land vendor, and is involved in trying to offset the very complicated provisions of the clause and of Schedule 6 against existing tax liability, a two-year provision—in effect for getting the sums right—is a very modest request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I know what the Minister will say. If I am wrong, I am sure that he will shake his head vigorously. He will say that the Revenue is always reasonable in trying to deal with taxpayers' problems. The Minister shakes his head to say "No". Perhaps he thinks that the Revenue is not always reasonable in dealing with taxpayers' problems. But the Revenue often allows the Minister to use his discretion for taxpayers making their own arrangements and allows instalment payments. The Minister may ask us not to force the amendment because it will be two years and that is what the Revenue will feel bound by. But I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically at the general point which my hon. Friend raised in the amendment. That point is that the taxpayer should be given a proper time allowance to get through the enormous complexities of the iteraction of tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hitchin seeks to extend the period in which relief can be claimed by a further two years from the point on which the DLT position was finalised. That could be a very long period indeed. As I understand it, the wording of the amendment is taken from Section 18(8) of the Finance Act 1975 which dealt with stock relief and provided an extra six months, in that case a transitional six months, provided that the claim was made within six months of the Royal Assent to that Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was a special kind of relief given in very special circumstances. My advice is that we do not see that there will be a problem in relation to development land tax because the present provisions regarding the time limit for claims are adequate. The hon. Gentleman did not put forward
	<span class='label label-info column'>1230</span>
any case. He mentioned generally cases where there was retrospection but did not put forward any particular case where there might be difficulty and where the present time limits in the legislation are not sufficient to deal with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have looked at the matter and my advice is that the present limits are sufficient. To add another two years would merely add a complication without improving the matter. I am always reluctant to turn down an amendment which seeks to give a taxpayer additional time in which to make his claim, but in practice, I think that the position is adequately met. If there were specific examples and if hon. Gentlemen could give me concrete examples of the kind of situation where the present time limits are not long enough, I would be prepared to look at those cases without any commitment in relation to the amendment. I cannot recommend that the Committee accepts the amendment because I think that the present time limits are fully adequate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a very technical area. I do not wish to press ahead with the amendment at present. The fact that the Minister has looked at it and believes that there are not likely to be practical cases in which problems would arise because of the retrospective application of the interaction provisions is somewhat reassuring. We should like to reconsider the position in the light of what he has said. In view of the tone of his comments, I hope that if we find that there are indeed practical cases which might be frustrated or inconvenienced by the lack of a time limit adjustment of this kind he will be willing to take that point into account at a later stage of the Bill. As I understand it, that is the case and that is his attitude, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be convenient also to discuss New Clause 12—	<i>Interaction of development land tax with other taxes—</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>'(1) Where any development land tax has been charged at any time since the appointed day in respect of the whole or any part of the interest in land, no liability shall arise to—
	<ol>
	<li>capital gains tax;</li>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1230">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1231</span>
	<li>income tax; and</li>
	<li>capital transfer tax</li>

in respect of any disposal of the whole or any part of that interest which is also brought into account, in whole or in part, for the purposes of—
	<ol>
	<li>tax on chargeable gains;</li>
	<li>tax on profits or gains of a trade;</li>
	<li>capital transfer tax;</li>
	<li>section 80 or section 82 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 (certain capital sums to be taxable as rent);</li>

	<br><blockquote><p>(2) Where any—
	<ol>

	<li>corporation tax,</li>
	<li>income tax,</li>
	<li>estate duty,</li>
	<li>capital transfer tax</li>
</ol>
has been paid previously in respect of the whole or any part of the interest in land on which development land tax is payable, the amount on which that tax or duty has been levied shall be deemed to be part of the cost of acquisition for the purpose of section 5 of this Act'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should explain, Mr. Costain, that New Clause 12 started off on my desk as an amendment and ended up on the Order Paper as a new clause. I have no doubt that that is a perfectly correct technical way of dealing with it. I make no complaint on that score. A rather more amateur attempt to achieve the same thing was the tabling of Amendment No. 379 seeking to leave out Clause 33. Of course I understand that that, in effect, is a stand part debate and we come to it at this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What we had in mind was that it would be helpful to the Committee and to our deliberations if we had the opportunity of considering the general principles of the interaction of taxes, which are embodied in Clause 33 and more specifically in Schedule 6, before we come to the details. All the points that I have raised so far in relation to Clause 33, although some have been very important ones, have been in essence detailed points. Much the same applies to the amendments which have been selected for our debates on Schedule 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This was, therefore, an attempt to have some sort of introductory discussion of the principles underlying the details. I do not know whether it is a practice that we might consider in the House and in Committee, that with very complicated legislation one might almost have a kind of Second Reading debate clause by clause rather than a stand part debate, or at least try to deal with these things the other way round procedurally. When one has
	<span class='label label-info column'>1232</span>
very complex legislation, that might be a better way of doing it. So often in our discussions the general points only emerge as appendages to the detailed amendments which are tabled. I do not wish to labour that procedural suggestion, but I think that it might be worth consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the provisions of Schedule 6, which are technical and which flow from Clause 33, provide cases of interaction between taxes. But that itself is not a strictly accurate description of the situation. In some cases, there is interaction of one tax against another tax. In other cases, there is a division of value so that one tax applies to part of the value of a gain and another tax applies to the other part of the value of the such a gain. In the second case, the important thing is to decide where is the dividing line within the total gain and how to apportion it between development land tax and another tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a third category of interaction where one tax is not offset against another, but the tax is offset against the gain which is chargeable to development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, then, these three different kinds of interaction, and in going through the provisions of Schedule 6 which hang on Clause 33 we shall have to come to a number of examples of the way this works out in particular situations. One difficulty of Clause 33 and Schedule 6 is that of determining what practical situations involve the different types of interaction. When one talks of a development land tax disposal following a capital gains tax or a trading disposal, or the other way round, when one talks of simultaneous disposals which may take place in the case of a sale or a lease; when one talks of the transfer of property on gift or death, which subsequently comes within the scope of development land tax, one has to work out a number of things—which of these events is earlier, whether they are simultaneous, whether if not simultaneous they may be deemed to be simultaneous, and therefore which of these types of interaction will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to go into all the details of what may happen in particular cases, but I think it fair to make these remarks by way of a retrospective look at Clause 33, and as a trailer for Schedule 6. We are talking in general terms about principles which do not come through clearly from the Bill as it stands. If one reads Clause 33 and Schedule 6, it is not easy
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1231">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1233</span>
to establish in which cases tax is offset against tax, value divided from value, or tax set against value. Even when one thinks one has decided which principle applies to a particular case, it is not easy to see the principle underlying it. At the end of the day one can probably work out what lies behind the thinking but, if I may make a suggestion, it might have been helpful if these general principles had been incorporated in the explanatory notes of the Development Land Tax Bill. As they stand, one sees:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (1) Introduces Schedule 6 which deals with the interaction of DLT with other taxes."</p></blockquote>
Fine: that is exactly what it does.
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (3) Defines the terms used in Schedule 6."</p></blockquote>
That is fine too: that is exactly what it does. But what we would really like to know is not what the words in the Bill mean, but what is actually in contemplation, and that might take place in the context either of Clause 33 or of Schedule 6. Without them, one has to look at the details, find out what they mean, and then see why the detailed provisions were arranged as they were. It is made more complicated by the fact that not every possible circumstance which could involve the interaction of taxes is actually dealt with, either in Clause 33 or in Schedule 6, and therefore one has to make some assumptions about the principles on which the interaction is based.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have said quite enough on this point, but I should like to have it on record that, though the clause looks simple, the provisions of Schedule 6 which hang from it are exceptionally complicated, as anybody will readily find who attempts to work out examples of how they might turn out in practice. Therefore, a commentary of this kind as well as a bare explanation of the meaning of the wording would have been useful to us, and would have saved a great deal of time and trouble not only for myself and other members of the Committee but many who will have to operate the legislation in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we leave Clause 33, may I say that I am grateful to the Minister for certain undertakings which he has given. We have tried to raise serious points about impediments to the working of the Bill. To that extent we are grateful that
	<span class='label label-info column'>1234</span>
the Government have accepted these points, but we feel that it is a necessary function of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall have to look again at some of the Minister's comments, but Clause 33, subject to the matters which remain to be considered, is acceptable in that when a tax of this kind is introduced it has by nature to interact with every other tax on the statute book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I followed with great interest and pleasure the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart). I thought he gave a reasonable summary of the difficulties which have arisen. There was one thing, however, with which I did not agree. He said casually in passing that Clause 33 looks simple on the surface. It does not look simple to me. He went on to qualify that by saying that Schedule 6 looked difficult and indeed was difficult. But, comparatively speaking, I suppose Clause 33 is simple compared with Schedule 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister a practical question which relates to subsection (3) (	<i>b</i>) which defines a DLT disposal for the purposes of Schedule 6, I am not clear why the definition is necessary in that place. The whole of Clause 2 is about deemed disposals, saying what they are, in what circumstances they arise, and so on. In the definitions Clause 46 we have a further definition of "deemed disposal". We all know that deemed disposal is one part of the disposal procedure. Why was it felt necessary to have a special definition in this clause of a DLT disposal for the purposes of Schedule 6? Moreover, the definition is of such general possible terms, that is to say
	<br><blockquote><p>"a DLT disposal' means a disposal … of an interest in land "—</p></blockquote>
other than a nil disposal which occurs in Clause 12 and elsewhere. I find that hard to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be said that we should not look a gift horse in the mouth. Whenever we get a definition in this Bill we should be grateful, because most of the Bill is incomprehensible anyway. The definition does not seem to be particularly useful or helpful and I am a little puzzled about why it occurs in this place. I should have thought that the correct place for all definitions, if there are to be any, should be in the general Clause 46.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1232">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1235</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with the question about the DLT disposals by telling the hon. Gentleman that the definition of "DLT disposal" excludes a disposal for which no consideration is given, that is, a gift or bequest to which the rules in Clause 10 apply. This exclusion enables relief for capital gains tax, capital transfer tax and so on, paid on a gift or on death to be given on a subsequent DLT disposal. This is dealt with in Parts II and III of Schedule 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, if a transfer for no consideration were treated as a DLT disposal, I suppose there would be nothing against which credit could be given. It would be a transfer for no consideration and any capital gains tax credit or income tax credit could not be set off against anything. Thus, that kind of disposal for no consideration is not a DLT disposal, so the credit is not lost. The reason the definition is there in that form is to ensure that credit remains on a subsequent transfer and is not lost because there is nothing against which it can be set on a disposal for no consideration. I assure the hon. Gentleman that it is necessary to have the definition there for that reason, otherwise the taxpayer would lose that exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) has rightly said that this is a complicated provision. Unfortunately, our fiscal law is complicated. There is a large number of taxes and it is necessary to provide for relief against those taxes. It should not be forgotton that Clause 33 and Schedule 6 are to ensure that there should be no double taxation. It is not right that there should be double taxation. Both clause and schedule have to go into the matter in considerable detail to make sure that every conceivable situation is covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The alternative, which is possibly canvassed in Amendment No. 379 and the new clause, would be to set it out much more simply. But I am afraid that if one were to do that one would give far greater discretion either to the Board of Inland Revenue, to the Special Commissioners, or both. Where a taxpayer is claiming tax back or a deduction, most hon. Gentlemen will agree that it is better that it should be clearly set out in statute than that there should be a discretion in cases of this kind. It would be impossible for commissioners to build up a body of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1236</span>
case law, or practice, which would cover every case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take what the hon. Gentleman said about new Clause 12, which is probably too simple, but will he ask the draftsmen to look again at the drafting of Clause 33(5)? That appears to be an unnecessary reference by legislation, and it would be much easier for the taxpayer for it to be set out in a more meaningful form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Throughout the Committee stage I have been very happy to consider suggestions on drafting from all quarters, whether from The House-Builders Federation, The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, or anywhere else, without prejudice. It must also be said, in all fairness to the parliamentary draftsman, that he is an extremely experienced person and he does not draft anything without consideration in great detail. I am, therefore, reluctant to say that the draftsman has not got this right and that the hon. Gentleman's suggestion is better. The draftsman has been extraordinarily successful in framing legislation in an extremely difficult area. I am reluctant on every occasion that the drafting appears faulty to hon. Gentlemen to say that we will look at it, because that will mean we will have to look at it, and we do so, but at the end of the day it is the draftsman who is qualified to do this work and his standards are, as the hon. Gentleman knows, very high indeed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>INTERACTION OF DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX WITH OTHER TAXES</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 265, in page 103, line 23, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'and where a development gain (within the meaning of Part III of the Finance Act 1974) as well as a chargeable gain accrues the deduction shall in the first instance be applied exclusively to the development gain, so that only if the amount of the deduction exceeds the amount of the development gain is the balance of the deduction applied to the amount of the chargeable gain'.</p></blockquote>
The reason for this amendment is to provide for a number of practical cases
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1237</span>
in which development land tax falls to be charged prior to a charge to development gains. As with all these amendments, in this case it may be that somewhere within the provisions of the schedule the intent of the amendment is achieved in other ways. If it is, it will serve to put on record where and how that is achieved. If it is not, the amendment will serve to make the case for seeing that such provisions should be within the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sort of situation I have in mind is where there has been a no-gain, no-loss disposal before the appointed day. According to the provisions of the Bill, one stays on development gains tax almost indefinitely. That may be right, but it does not appear to be offsetable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a development is started before the appointed day for the purposes of development land tax, under outline planning permission, and then detailed planning permission is obtained after the appointed day, it is that detailed planning permission which decides the start for the purposes of development land tax, and not the original commencement with outline planning permission. In that case, there could be an unrelieved overlap between the development gains tax and the development land tax which this Bill introduces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case of this sort would arise if a lease is granted before the appointed day and, after the appointed day, a development were to be started. Under the development gains arrangements, one would still be on a potential charge for development gains tax running through from before the appointed day. One would also be involved with a potential charge to development land tax on the same interest in land, and the same profit arising from it, on the disposal of the reversion subsequent to this development which started after the appointed day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will tell me that the amendment is unnecessary, because in relation to the provisions of Clauses 35 and 36, which deal with the termination of the development gains charge, there are other provisions somewhere which deal with this interaction. But to a number of people whom I have consulted it has not been clear whether such is the case. We therefore hope either that the Minister can reassure us that this is an unfounded anxiety, or that he can take on board the point which we are making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentioned that a number of bodies which deal with these matters have expressed reservations about the examples he mentioned and the need to provide interaction relief. I hope that I can reassure him that the amendment is unnecessary, but I should like to go in some detail into the precise examples he gave.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>6.9 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming—</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since the examples given by the hon. Gentleman have also been the subject of representations, and as there has been some disquiet, perhaps I may deal with the examples he gave in order to allay fears.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, there is no need to provide interaction relief between DLT and the development gains charge because Clause 34 provides that the development gains charge ceases to apply on or after the appointed day. There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, DLT may be payable on the disposal of an interest in land which has already been subject to the development gains charge—for example, on a gift. This situation is covered by paragraph 16 of Schedule 6. Relief is given in that particular case, which is one of the exceptions to the general rule that it is not necessary to give relief for development gains charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second exception is that both DLT and the development gains charge may be payable on a disposal in certain cases where the development gains charge continues to apply after the appointed day. One of these cases is where material development was begun after 17th December 1973—the Barber proposals—and before the appointed day, and the interest in land is not disposed of before that day. The development gains charge is continued in these circumstances to tax the development value realised by the material development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is, I am assured, no possibility of double taxation because, for the purposes of DLT, that material development will be reflected in current use value while, for the purposes of the development gains charge, the net proceeds of the post-appointed day disposals are restricted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1239</span>
under Clause 35(5) to the current use value of the interest—that is, it applies only to the development value realised by the material development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second case is where an acquisition of an interest in land after 17th December 1973 but before the appointed day was treated for the purposes of capital gains tax as taking place on a no-gain, no-loss basis—one example of that would be an acquisition by a wife from her husband—and the interest is not disposed of before that day. Clause 36 continues the development gains charge in these circumstances because development land tax has regard to the actual consideration passing to the extent that this is greater than the amount of consideration assumed under the no-gain, no-loss rule for the purposes of capital gains tax and that slice of development value would otherwise only be liable to capital gains tax. I shall deal with that particular case in a moment, but it is one case where there could be a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another case where there could be a problem is where a lease was granted after 17th December 1973, but before the appointed day, and the reversion on the lease is not disposed of before that day. On a subsequent disposal of the reversion only the right to reoccupy the land when the lease expires is liable to development land tax, so any development value which is reflected in the rents would not be chargeable. Since the development gains charge would not have fallen on the development value of the rents when the lease was granted because it, like capital gains tax, has regard only to premiums, it is necessary to continue the charge to catch the development value on the disposal of the reversion. This is done under Clause 36.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In these two cases—in the no-gain, no-loss situation and the example I gave of a disposal by a wife to her husband or a husband to a wife—there could be a potential danger of double taxation because the development gains charge will operate in the normal way. But it is possible that a development land tax liability will also arise. However, the interaction rules in Part I of Schedule 6 provide for the chargeable realised development value accruing on the development land tax disposal to be deducted from the chargeable gain for the purposes of capital gains tax, under paragraph 1(1) and (2),
	<span class='label label-info column'>1240</span>
and this will restrict the development gain so as to prevent double taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I should add that the Schedule 6 offset against the chargeable gain will, first of all, go against the development gain element—there will be a top slice relief first. Secondly if there is any balance, it will go against the capital gains element, after the first relief has been allowed against development gains charge. So in the two cases which the hon. Gentleman mentioned there will be relief because of the interaction provisions of Part I of Schedule 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, the amendments are not necessary, and I hope that I have allayed the fears that have been expressed. Perhaps I should add that the amendments go further, possibly, than hon. Gentlemen would wish. I shall not go into detail, because that would be unnecessary. The main point is that the amendments are unnecessary and relief is given in the legislation for the particular examples which the hon. Gentleman mentioned and about which representations have been made to us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that I presented the amendment in the guise of a probing amendment, although I did not describe it as such. Having considered carefully the representations which have been made to us, I had a sneaking feeling that it was not necessary for reasons which the Minister of State has now confirmed. Nevertheless, it is an area of extreme complexity. It does not transpire, without the Minister's explanation, which I agree can be inferred from a detailed knowledge of the whole Bill, that it is the current use value uplift which deals with the main problem I was trying to describe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tabling of this amendment has been very important in that it has produced an elucidation of something which has baffled not only me and no doubt other members of the Committee but professional people outside the House who, on reading these provisions, felt that there was a considerable problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot reply in detail to what the Minister said, nor do I propose to do so. For the sake of this afternoon's proceedings, I am prepared to take his word for it in the way in which he has explained the matter, but I should like to give
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1241</span>
thought to the way in which the parts of the Bill which he has quoted as dealing with the situation actually relate to the examples which I mentioned, such as outline planning permission, leases, and so on. I have no reason to suspect that what the Minister said is not correct, but it is an important point. Although I shall return to it at my desk, I do not wish to delay the Committee any longer. Therefore, in the light of the Minister's explanation, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 417 in page 104, leave out lines 30 to 35.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those lines constitute subparagraph (6) of Schedule 6(1). According to the simple explanation in the Inland Revenue booklet, the subparagraph provides that the deduction from the chargeable gain is not allowed to create a loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there are any instances where the purity of the concept of the development land tax ought to be slightly adjusted, it is in the case where a loss will result by applying the unrelieved tax in a situation—probably a trading situation—where, at the end of the day, an actual loss is incurred. Merely relieving other taxation from development land tax is not a benefit, because development land tax in itself is greater than the whole of the profit, and a loss situation arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been a number of instances where the virginity of the development land tax concept has been—which word should I use here?—impaired by the provisions of the Bill as it stood before it came into Committee. We have impaired it a little further as we have moved on with various concessions which are acceptable to the Committee in relation to charities and certain reliefs and deferrals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the case of losses, it goes against all reason that if a loss arises where development land tax has been charged, DLT should at least be relieved to the extent that a loss is created from that situation. Probably such events will occur through a general change in market values. They could occur through the incompetence of a company dealing with development land, but on the whole they are more likely to result when market forces have changed and the value of land of one kind
	<span class='label label-info column'>1242</span>
or the other has undergone a considerable change so that at the end of the day there is a loss to the company which has suffered development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although in its purer concept the land tax is a levy, it is nevertheless treated as a tax for many purposes of the Bill, and it seems eminently desirable that it should be treated as a tax in this context where otherwise, if it were not relieved, it would give rise to a loss.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to grant relief where the double taxation relief creates a loss. I think that is the kind of situation we are asked to meet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 1(6) of Schedule 6 provides that deduction in respect of DLT from a chargeable gain is not allowed to create a loss. The amendment would seek to allow that loss, if a loss were created, to be offset against something else. The loss would then be set-offable against income tax, corporation tax or some further DLT. When one explains the amendment, one gets into the substantive difficulty behind it. There may be arguments on the matter of principle that losses generally should be allowed in this legislation, but here we are concerned with a double taxation relief for interaction relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schedule seeks to ensure that a person cannot pay two lots of tax on one gain, if it is put as simply as that. If a person has paid capital gains tax on a chargeable gain or corporation tax on a trading gain, and if, quite separately from that, there is a charge to DLT, he is not to be charged twice. The amount on which DLT is charged is to be deducted from the other tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is right and proper. However, the hon. Gentleman seeks to go further by saying that if that process of deduction creates a loss, that loss should be allowed too. That is going further than double taxation relief. It is for that reason that I cannot accept the amendment because we want to ensure that a person does not pay two lots of tax on one gain. We cannot go further and say that if a person has not paid that much tax and his gain is not great enough to enable him to set off two taxes, whatever is left over in the way of loss can be set off against something else. I think that is what the hon. Gentleman wishes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept the amendment because I do not think that it fits into a situation where one gives relief for taxation against
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1243</span>
profit. If there is no profit, it is hard to expect relief to be continued. It is a relief against profit. If the profit is relieved, that is the end of the matter and that is the just and reasonable course to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had some new phrases introduced into our debates on the Bill—"impairing of virginities " and something being "set-offable", which is a wonderful phrase. That was the Minister's phrase. Perhaps we could adopt it somewhere in the Bill and put it in the definition clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to remove from the Bill a clear statement that, if there is a loss, it shall not be treated as a loss. In all other taxation, if one makes a loss one is entitled to treat it as a loss. We shall, when we come to new clauses—if you make that selection, Mr. Costain—discuss losses and the principle of introducing the recognition of losses into the Bill and into the payment of development land tax. I shall not go into that in detail at the moment, but surely it may well be here that the loss results not from development land tax but from the other taxes with which we are dealing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (6) goes a long way beyond saying that, if there is a negative realised development value, it should be treated as a loss. It goes further by saying that, however the schedule is applied, and however taxes are interacting one against the other, if a loss is shown as a result it shall not be treated as a loss. Moreover, it seems from the subsection that it shall not be treated as a loss for all other purposes of taxation. It is a sweeping subsection. The Minister, in his explanation, cut down the sweeping nature of it, but it still seems to me to be very wide.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that Amendment No. 426 was obviously designed to rectify a printing error because nothing is very obvious in this Bill, and I had to read that passage two or three times to satisfy myself that it was a printing error. It is gratifying to have confirmation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We move to Amendment No. 221. Amendment No. 220 has been selected for consideration with it by your good judgment, Mr. Costain, and they both indeed relate to the same point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to grasp the significance of this amendment, we need to look at paragraph 6 which, as the heading tells us, relates to the reduction of profits or gains on a contemporaneous disposal. Where a development land tax disposal, the explanatory notes tell us, is also a trading disposal as defined in Clause 33, the amount of the chargeable realised development value is allowable as a deduction in computing the profits or gains of the trade. Subparagraph (2) tells us that the deduction is treated as a trading expense incurred on the date of the trading disposal for the purpose of determining the year of assessment or the accounting period in which it is to be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not a very happy situation, as a deemed disposal may take place considerably before the trading disposal concerned. Indeed, any development involves a deemed disposal at the beginning of the day, but by its very nature it does not involve an actual trading disposal until the building being developed is completed and sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendments is therefore to ensure that in such a situation, on a deemed disposal, a developer or
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1245</span>
trader in land is entitled to claim a deduction for the purposes of computing profits in respect of the year in which the deemed disposal occurs, and that he does not have to wait until the actual time of disposal to obtain that deduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, it may be that the provisions of the Bill taken all together by some means or other provide for the situation covered by the amendment. However, it is not obvious on reading the Bill that that is so, even though on referring back to Clause 33(3) one finds the definitions of disposals, and throughout the Bill these include deemed disposals. What worries us is the problem of the timing of the disposal for the purpose of the deduction in computing profits. That is why we have tabled the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is concerned with granting interaction relief at the time of a deemed disposal. As we have debated in the Committee, and as the Bill provides, a development land tax charge arises on a deemed disposal when there is, for instance, a commencement of a project of material development, although there are provisions for spreading the tax over a period of eight years or 16 half-yearly instalments. But the tax charge crystallises at the point of the deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment desires and provides that at that point in time in some way the DLT tax charge or the amount on which DLT is payable shall be deductible from something or other—I do not know quite what it is to be deductible from, as at that point in time there is no trading profit in respect of the particular development that has commenced. Development is commenced and DLT is payable. The development is then no doubt completed some time later, and on completion of the development, hopefully, a trading profit arises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Bill is drafted, when that trading profit arises, it is then possible to deduct from that the amount on which DLT was payable. I should have thought that that was the only way in which it could be done. At the point of the deemed disposal there is no trading profit in respect of that particular development against which to set the amount on which development land tax is charged. There may be other trading profits, but nothing to do with that particular development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1246</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the absurdity in the tax rather than the amendment? As the Minister rightly pointed out, this is a tax on nothing. He cannot have it both ways. If we are taxing nothing, one might as well allow that tax against something. To my mind, the absurdity is in the whole philosophy of the tax, not in the amendment. If we could only get back to a situation where we were taxing something, as at least existed under development gains tax, the kind of paradox, enigma and absurdity that he has pointed to would not exist. The absurdity is in the very philosophy of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have debated this at length and know the views of Opposition Members on the charge and deemed disposal. The Bill provides that there will be a charge at that time. In dealing with the argument I have to argue from that premise. The amendment seeks to change the situation. The hon. Gentleman may agree that we are both being absurd, but, given the fact that the Bill charges tax on a deemed disposal, there is no way in which interaction relief can be given against a trading profit until the trading profit materialises. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman recognises this and no doubt he would say the same thing in relation to the amendment. I take the point he makes about the fundamental premises. For that reason I cannot accept the amendment because there is nothing against which one could set the DLT liability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are told by paragraph 6(1) that the deduction is allowable in computing the profits or gains of the trade. I understood that to mean the total trade of the chargeable person. The Minister has said that there will be nothing to deduct that from because there will not have been a profit or gain from that transaction at the start of a project of material development. But I thought we were dealing with the whole trade of the chargeable person. I have the Explanatory Note on subparagraph (2), which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The deduction is treated as a trading expense incurred on the date of the trading disposal for the purpose of determining the year of assessment or accounting period in which it is to be taken into account."</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that that meant against the whole trading profits of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1247</span>

	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 386, in page 111, leave out subparagraphs (3) to (9).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we can discuss Amendment No. 418, in page 114, line 1, leave out from beginning to line 43 on page 115.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The provisions of subparagraphs (3) to (9) relate to the circumstances where a trader, by paying development land tax at the rate of 66⅔ per cent.—high enough, in all conscience—finds that this is less tax than he would pay if he were taxed on that gain or income as if it were income chargeable to his own top rate of personal taxation. For this purpose during the three years until 1st April 1979—this period is described as the interim financial years—there is what is described as a deficiency of tax, the difference between 66⅔ per cent. and the top rate, or any other rate above 66⅔ per cent. of personal taxation which might apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This excess of taxation which he must then pay to make up the difference is described, with great charm, as a deficiency of tax, but is really a surplus of tax. Surely if 66⅔ per cent. is the right rate of tax, and the purity of this tax is to be unimpaired, it should apply in the case of these traders as well as anybody else, or are we to have a further impairment, if that is the right word, in this case?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason for this amendment is to illustrate that the rate of 66⅔ per cent. up to the year 1979 was, as the former Paymaster-General explained, in order to encourage the bringing forward of land for development in the next three years. We have had a difficult period in the building industry, and we are not through it yet. The hope was that if there was a rate of tax which would apply in all cases at the minimum rate of 80 per cent., starting in 1979, a concessionary rate of 66⅔ per cent. in the intervening period might encourage some owners of potential development land to realise their profit before 1979, because thereby they would pay tax at the rate of two-thirds of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1248</span>
chargeable gain rather than four-fifths of the chargeable gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one removes this incentive completely from personal traders there is no advantage in bringing forward land for development at an earlier date. In fact, one might just as well wait until it is seen that the tax will not work and the whole measure is scrapped, or a lower rate is introduced. It completely removes the incentive, if that is the right phrase, of a rate of tax of 66⅔ per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bringing the rate up will place traders on a personal account in a different situation from all other taxpayers. We cannot see, therefore, that it is very logical, if the whole purpose of the 66⅔ per cent. rate is to be carried out, that in this case it should not apply. That is the import of the amendments. We seek to alter the Bill so that whoever own development land between now and 1979 should have a parity of treatment in the rate of tax they will pay if they bring forward, as the Government want them to do, such land for development before that date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not pretend to be a taxation expert. However, I recall that somebody who was one told us that we did not have to order our affairs so as to maximise the tax that we pay. I believe that ruling still holds. It is one of the few benefits we are allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I listen to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) and try to understand the complexities of this part of this complex schedule, in this particularly complex legislation, I do not find it surprising that prejudiced people should sometimes think that the Revenue tries to have it both ways. The Revenue appears to be saying "We will always tax you at the highest rate that we can devise, and if, in order to arrive at that rate, we have to pretend that certain events have not happened, or would have, or would not have happened otherwise, we shall so pretend, and nothing you say shall be held against us". It appears to me that if a trader carries out transactions and incurs development land tax and makes a loss, that should be the end of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be interested to hear from the Minister some examples of the sort of circumstances in which the Revenue envisages these provisions coming into effect. We can then judge against one or two theoretical cases whether we are right
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1249</span>
in supposing that this is a particularly vexatious instance of the Revenue trying to have it both ways and insisting on levying a higher rate of tax than is appropriate in the circumstances. I therefore support my hon. Friend in moving this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) criticised this provision on the ground that it appeared to be inconsistent with the desire and the need to bring forward land for development, and the fact that we had reduced the rate to 66⅔ per cent. on the first £150,000 to achieve that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the hon. Gentleman meant to imply that this provision would apply to sales of land by people who were not traders. We are concerned here with the trader in land—in this case the unincorporated trader, the partnership or individual trading in land. We are not concerned with the farmer who sells his land to a developer. The rate could be 66⅔ per cent. up to £150,000 after the £10,000 slice exemption. This provision, which is the interaction part of the Bill, is concerned solely with traders in land and is aimed solely at the unincorporated trader who deals or trades in land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision is included because we accepted the representations made to us, that in order to bring land on to the market it is necessary to reduce the rate on the first £150,000 to 66⅔ per cent. But an unincorporated trader who, before this legislation paid tax at the rate of 83 per cent. top rate on the top slice of any trading profit, will still be charged at 83 per cent. The original proposal was to have a development land tax charge at a flat rate of 80 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here with the three years up to 1979. After that, this does not apply. If we had maintained a rate of 80 per cent., without reducing the rate to 66⅔ per cent. on the first £150,000, there would have been no need for this provision. It would have been left a 80 per cent. There would have been at 3 per cent. difference, but that would not have been significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But when it was decided to reduce the rate on the first £150,000 to 66⅔per cent. it was a reduction of tax of 16⅔ per cent. for traders who trade in land at present.
	<span class='label label-info column'>1250</span>
Conservative Members would say that that was a very good thing. They would say "Why do not the Government give that reduction of tax? It is unfair not to do so."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could we not have an example? Surely, after paying whatever rate of DLT is appropriate, the trader would still be subject to income tax on any profit he might have left and would pay it at the appropriate rate. Why should he be required to pay an inappropriate rate on his development profit?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know what "the appropriate rate" means. If we assume a situation in which the DLT rate is 80 per cent., as it will be after 1979, the trader will pay at 80 per cent. on the betterment profit, and he will then pay whatever is the income tax rate on the development profit. He will pay at 80 per cent. and then at 83 per cent. But because of the transitional arrangement, we felt that a reduction from 83 per cent. to 66⅔ per cent. in respect of his profit was not justifiable in the circumstances. That is why we have this provision in the legislation. It is a transitional provision; it applies for three years. Had we not had it, it would have meant a reduction from the present tax rates of 83 per cent. to 66⅔ per cent., if 83 per cent. was the trader's top rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, many traders would not get into that top rate, and, of course, they would not be affected. Many traders will be companies, and they are not affected. We are concerned here solely with the unincorporated trader. There may be a few of them in the building industry, although the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) told us some time ago that not many builders were sole traders or partners; mainly, they were companies. That is my experience, too. Most people in this type of business, where they will be paying tax at the rate of 83 per cent. on their profits, incorporate pretty quickly, because the advantages of incorporation, both fiscal and otherwise, far outweigh the advantages of remaining as sole traders or partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are not concerned with companies. We are only concerned with the situation in which the profits of a sole trader may be so high that his top rate may be 83 per
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1240">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1251</span>
cent. In that case, because we are reducing the development land tax charge for the three years to 66⅔ per cent., he will still pay at the higher rate in respect of the three years. The reason for this provision is that we felt that that kind of reduction would not be fair in all the circumstances. But, as I said, it only affects unincorporated traders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must say, even as a non-tax expert, that I find the Minister's idea of what is fair very strange indeed. Apparently, in his view, it is fair to tax a trader at a higher rate than anybody else. In fact, is discriminates against him. The Minister has advanced no reason at all why the trader should, in fairness, have to pay tax at a rate higher than everybody else. He will pay the then going rates of income tax. Let us face it, even the Labour Party might suddenly have a Damascus road conversion and realise that it hurries us down the road of economic decline to have such absurdly high rates at the top as we now have. Perhaps the Conservative Party did not do enough to stop it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Since my hon. Friend has mentioned the Damascus road, perhaps he will recall that that road was infested with robbers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not like there to be any suggestion, particularly over the Minister's shoulder, that we imagined that the Revenue was the same as robbers. It is just that we get that feeling sometimes. We do not know what the going rate of the top slice of income tax will be. Are we suggesting that if there is a more realistic rate, let us say of 60 per cent., there would be special arrangements to make sure that the trader paid less tax on his development land? Why cannot he be treated exactly the same as everybody else? We can work out the profit he has made and ask him to pay the then going appropriate rate of tax on that profit, work out the betterment gain that he has made, and he will pay the appropriate rate of tax on that betterment. Why is he treated differently?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has given us no explanation, except to say that it would be unfair for the trader to pay less tax for a period, which we hope that the Government in due course will lengthen, when there is a lower rate of development land tax on the first slice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1252</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister pointed to a position which is a result of the provisions about the deficiency of tax, to which perhaps I should have alluded in my introductory remarks. Far from there not being any incentive up to 1979, there is a positive disincentive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is an incentive to bring land on to the market, to bring land into the hands of the trader. That is the purpose of the reduction to 66⅔ per cent. The incentive is there. The person who is not a trader pays at 66⅔ per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point that I am making is that after 1979, if other tax rates remain the same, the trader would be paying 80 per cent. which would be lower than the present rate of personal tax. But if one is keeping only 17 per cent., an increase up to 20 per cent. is considerable. In fact, it is a 17 per cent. increase on 17 per cent., if my mental arithmetic is quick enough to do the sum. That is not inconsiderable. Therefore, the effect of this for traders is the exact opposite of the effect for anyone else. If the trader in land has land brought forward to him from somebody else, so that he can trade in the land or develop it he will have to incur a deemed disposal. But he will now have to wait until after 1979, otherwise he pays an even higher rate of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that this is one of those anomalies which run through the Bill. It is something on which we do not see eye to eye, but if development land tax is to have this preferential rate it would seem better to us that it should apply to everybody and should not add this extra degree of discrimination against the sole trader.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was hoping that my hon. Friend would say something about what would happen if one had different rates of income tax on the top slice. This is a difficulty which the Minister should face. Will he change this provision of the Bill if, in the Finance Bill, there is a sensible move to change the top rate of income tax or, even worse, if the Chancellor of the Exchequer has an idea to move it even further up the scale? That scarcely bears contemplation, but I can think of a few hon. Members opposite who would not mind it moving that way. What would happen to the schedule in those circumstances? Is the Minister able to give the Committee an assurance that it will be reviewed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the tax is reduced, the ceiling is reduced and the difference then is between 66⅔ per cent. and whatever the top figure is. If the top rate is reduced to 75 per cent. the difference is only between 66⅔ per cent. and 75 per cent. There is a mechanism in the legislation to provide that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It means merely that over three years the trader pays on the difference between 66⅔ per cent. in respect of gains up to £150,000. If his gains exceed that, he is within the 80 per cent. bracket anyway. But up to £150,000 for the three years he pays the extra between 66⅔ per cent. and whatever the top rate of income tax may be, if he comes into that bracket. He may not come into that bracket. But where he comes into that bracket he will pay that extra tax. That is the position under the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have argued against it and said that it was unfair, but it would also be unfair to have provided this quite fortuitous consequential reduction in tax from the top rate of 83 per cent. to 66⅔ per cent. in this kind of case.

	<span class='label label-info column'>1254</span>
The amendment proposes the addition of a subparagraph (10) to paragraph 6 of the schedule. We are still dealing with the interaction of development land tax with profits or gains of a trade. Here we refer to Sections 174 and 178 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 which deal with terminal losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a sense, the amendment was contained within the idea which we put to the Committee in Amendment No. 417 about the relief of losses. However, this is a specific case within the general question of losses, and one where there is particular merit for further consideration to be given by the Government on the possibility of approving arrangements for the relief of losses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is an amendment which is a further expression of the Opposition's general unhappiness on this whole issue, and is illustrated in this practical case. If we do not have the amendment, or a provision to the same effect, there could be un-relievable tax on termination, and this will naturally influence those who have to trade with companies where there may be the prospect of terminal losses. I do not say that other parties are not naturally deterred from trading with companies where there may be terminal losses, but if one adds a potential aggravation of the terminal loss—and I emphasise that development land tax will now be at a high rate, and eventually will be at an excessively high rate—the extra anxiety will tend to arise either at an earlier stage in the fortunes, or misfortunes, of a company, or indeed, may arise in cases where such anxiety might not otherwise have been justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this particular case, where terminal losses are involved, we hope that we will receive more encouragement from the Government than we received on the general matter of relief on losses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment makes the same point as previous amendments in relation to losses. The answer must be the same, that development land tax is a tax on an individual transaction, and if that transaction later on creates a trading profit the land tax liability is deducted from that profit. But here we are asked to set off the land tax liabiltity against terminal losses and go back for three years; that is, set off the liability against the losses of the trade in general. This goes against the whole principle of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1255</span>
the tax in that it is a tax on one particular transaction and relief is given in respect of the profits of that transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, we cannot accept the amendment. If there are no profits, there is nothing to set against losses and to carry the losses back for purposes of income tax would not accord with the principles of development land tax. We have given relief. We have ensured that there will not be any double taxation provisions in relation to development land tax on that particular transaction. If the transaction throws up a profit, the development land tax will be deducted from that profit. But to go further and set this off against general trading losses would go against the whole basis of the legislation. That may not commend itself to hon. Members opposite, but that is the only way in which the tax can operate. For that reason, I advise the Committee not to accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is true that the idea that the tax is a tax on individual transactions and therefore a loss cannot be set off against other transactions does not commend itself to this side of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that this was the only way that this tax could be operated. At this stage I merely want to say that it certainly is not the only way one can operate this tax. There is no reason in principle why the tax should not apply as a normal tax. The Minister calls it a tax, but it is not a tax at all; it is a levy on one individual transaction or on one property and as such it is in a form to which the Opposition continue to object.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have gone through the arguments again and again. I do not wish to repeat them, but I wish to put on record that this is not the way to deal with a tax of this sort.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>1256</span>
value which accrues on the DLT disposal were a reference to a sum equal to so much thereof as appears just and reasonable on a comparison of the subject matter of the principal disposal with that of the earlier deemed disposal referred to in paragraph 7 above; and if, in any other'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you have said, Mr. Costain, that we may take Amendment No. 182, perhaps I could begin by explaining to the Committee that the way in which this has been drafted is, in effect, partly to replace subsection (3) by some extra wording which will follow on and lead into the wording of subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point in the schedule we are concerned with the situation in which a development land tax disposal precedes a capital gains tax or a trading disposal. The normal situation in which that would occur is where a development land tax disposal is a deemed disposal. It will precede the other disposal because it will take place at the start of a project of material development. In due course that material development will give rise to the property which eventually will be disposed of. It is at that point that the other taxation comes into the picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One has to go back to various provisions within the schedule to see what happens in such a case. The case which I particularly have in mind is that of the development of houses. I think that this is obvious. Most developments which are disposed of 	<i>en bloc</i> are of single items of related structures, such as offices, factories, shops or whatever it may be. The classic case of part disposals will be that of houses, as they will be sold off singly, whilst in most cases the development of which they are part will have been commenced on a larger scale to include a number of houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The concern here, therefore, is that the whole of the development land tax liability of a housebuilder, whatever the Government may pretend, in practice represents a charge to tax at an especially high rate on what is in effect only one section of his trading profits. Any scaling down on comparison of the development land tax proceeds with the sale price is therefore inappropriate. It is felt that the whole amount chargeable to development land tax ought to be eliminated from the ordinary tax assessment as and when plots covered by the development land tax charge are sold to individual purchasers as a part disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A particularly harsh situation would arise in a case of changing market values
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1243">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1257</span>
such as we have had over the last two or three years. Many of the houses which were commenced about 1972–73 would have to have been sold at a time when the housing market frankly collapsed in a way which has possibly not occurred to such an extent on any other occasion since the second world war, certainly not within my recollection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ultimate disposal proceeds for these houses which constitute the part disposals would therefore have been much lower than had been contemplated at the time that development value was assessed in relation to the land. At that time, the development could have been expected to give rise to a much higher sale price at the end of the day. Working backwards, therefore, one would have been concerned with a much higher development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If what proved in retrospect to have been an over-optimistic view of the potential return prevailed at that time, these conditions would be particularly harsh. In those circumstances, if the housebuilder had to reduce the price of the houses in order to attract purchasers, his loss would be aggravated by the fact that part of the deduction from taxable profits would be withheld from him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this goes against one of the principles that the Minister has constantly enunciated. Nevertheless, those principles have been breached at certain points for very good reasons. It seems to us that this is a case where if the pure concept of the tax is followed it may bear unduly harshly. In doing so, it will only cause problems at present; it will also be a further discouragement to housebuilders in future. Always in the past the development value element has been a buffer against trading losses which may arise due to a fall in market value. It is also, of course, a buffer of value to lenders. If I may speak for a moment, in an aside, as a banker, the value of property net of development land tax will make it very much less attractive as security for borrowing the money with which the houses can be built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore feel that if the Government are going to be soft-hearted at all and recognise the realities of the situation, so far as the housebuilding industry is concerned they would be well advised to be a little generous in this particular instance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>8.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has made an impassioned speech urging Ministers to be generous. But he does not seem to have spoken exactly to the amendment, because, looking at the words of the amendment, I see the phrase "just and reasonable". I am tempted to make a speech about "just and reasonable", but I will not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are much narrower than the hon. Gentleman seemed to indicate, because they try to alter the rules which are now contained in paragraph 8(4) to arrive at inter-action provisions in respect of part disposal. They want to change the rules to apply "just and reasonable" solutions. It is not necessary for me in this Committee to say that there are great dangers in applying a just and reasonable test, especially when a taxpayer is claiming relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subparagraphs (3) to (5) of paragraph 8 set out the rules for determining how much inter-action relief should be given when a deemed disposal is followed by a part disposal. The hon. Gentleman referred to the builder who is engaged in selling off the houses, and in part disposals, for the purpose of this legislation. Where a deemed disposal is followed by a part disposal, the rules in these subparagraphs will apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general rule in paragraph 8(4) is that if the consideration for the part disposal, as brought into account in computing the trading profits, is equal to or exceeds the consideration for the deemed disposal, then the whole of the chargeable realised development value which accrued on the deemed disposal is available as a deduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So at the first point of time it may be possible for the builder to get a complete relief in respect of development land tax which he paid on the deemed disposal, provided that the market value at the commencement of the project in material development is equal to what exceeds the consideration for a deemed disposal. In some cases that will not be the case and then the relief will be scaled down in accordance with the fraction in the particular paragraphs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments would substitute for these detailed rules a provision allowing a just and reasonable apportionment of the chargeable realised development value. This would have the advantage of not requiring the expenditure on improvement between the deemed disposal and the part
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1259</span>
disposal to be calculated. From that point of view it would simplify the legislation, but it would have the serious disadvantage of leaving the taxpayer uncertain of his tax position and would encourage contentious appeals. This would result in the Special Commissioners having to work out from a body of case law general rules to deal with this kind of situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paragraph is complicated, because we have to deal with a number of very complex situations. I think it is better that it should be dealt with in this way, in legislation, and we shall expect the Special Commissioners or some other appellate body to decide what is "just and reasonable" in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, we cannot accept the amendment. I accept that there may be difficulties in working out the computation but I think it is better that we should have detailed rules and that some bodies should decide what is "just and reasonable" in every case, because the builder will not know what view of "just and reasonable" a tribunal will take. Although it may mean a bit more work and computation, it is better to rely on detailed rules in a field like this, especially in taxation, than to rely on vaguer rules and the discretion of a tribunal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 183, in page 113, line 50, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'8. Where, but for the reduction in a company's profits resulting from a deduction under paragraph 6(1) above, an amount of advance corporation tax within the meaning of Part V of the Finance Act 1972 could under section 85 of that Act have been set against liability for corporation tax on the income of any accounting period, the amount so excluded from set-off shall, on a claim being made for the purpose, be repaid to the company.'</p></blockquote>
The effect of this amendment is to add a new provision to paragraph 8, which deals with part disposals. This relates to a rather important point about advance corporation tax. With the introduction of development land tax, a considerable part of the profits of some companies which deal in property and development will no longer be charged to corporation tax. They will instead be charged to development land tax. In that sense, the base on which corporation tax is charged has been reduced. Over the whole range
	<span class='label label-info column'>1260</span>
of corporation tax, this is perhaps not a large figure, but in relation to these companies it may be a considerable proportion of what would have been their profits chargeable to corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the advance corporation tax arrangements were introduced, companies knew that they had to work on the basis that the advance corporation tax deducted from what would have been, in effect, the gross dividends which they paid had to be offset against the mainstream corporation tax of those companies, and they have in many cases tried to arrange their affairs so that they do not have a surplus of advance corporation tax which is unrelieved by corporation tax which they would fall to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If for such companies the amount of corporation tax which they will have to pay is reduced, a considerable disadvantage is automatically imposed upon them, in that they may either have some of their advance corporation tax which is no longer offsetable, or they may have a greater part of their advance corporation tax not offsetable. It will apply in this case to a particular part of the corporate sector, and in this respect such companies will be at a disadvantage against other companies on the basis of the advance corporation tax system. When the advance corporation tax system was brought in, it took into account the level of dividends and the amount of corporation tax which companies paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Thus, we are substantially changing the amount of corporation tax payable by such companies. We feel, therefore, that it could considerably prejudice the raising of capital in the future, because companies—particularly public companies—have to pay dividends to get further capital. They cannot expect to raise further money. The same applies to private companies. Perhaps the new Equity Bank will require companies to pay dividends at a certain level before they will be able to get funds from that source.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The payment of dividends is closely related to the capital-raising function of all companies and, in this case, in the development and building sector, companies will be disadvantaged in that there will now be a greater amount of un-relievable non-offsetable advance corporation tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think this case is comparable to that of development gains tax. In that case, it did not apply to companies except on the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1245">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1261</span>
first letting charge. The first letting charge, by its nature, applies normally to the granting of leases on offices and factories and other types of some commercial premises. These were generally being held for investment purposes by property companies, and the reason for the introduction of the first letting charge was that otherwise no tax was payable if such companies retained these properties as investments. So they were not going to dispose of them normally and they were not normally liable to corporation tax rates on trading profits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think one can say that the fact that advance corporation tax and development gains tax have not had this sort of relief in the past is any guide to the situation as it should be with development land tax. What in practice, even though not in theory, takes place under the development land tax arrangements is that the part of what would have been the ordinary trading profits of building and development companies will no longer be charged for corporation tax but for development land tax against which ACT is not offsetable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment seeks to set off development land tax against advance corporation tax or to set off advance corporation tax against development land tax. It does not really matter which because the result is the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that the hon. Gentleman makes is that there may very well not be enough profit chargeable to corporation tax against which one can set off development land tax. There is this fund of advance corporation tax against which he suggests the development land tax should be set.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a fairly attractive proposition, except that it has been made previously in relation to other taxes. Representations are made that capital allowances, for instance, should be set off against advance corporation tax. There is an objection in principle here. I served on the Select Committee on corporation tax. My hon. Friend the Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) is not here, but he also was a member of that distinguished Committee which came out in favour of the present imputation system. I think perhaps we made a mistake, but that is with hindsight. We were influenced by the evidence of one
	<span class='label label-info column'>1262</span>
gentleman who was very persuasive, but we probably got it wrong. That is beside the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Advance corporation tax is a kind of credit for the shareholder. The shareholder can set off advance corporation tax—which is deducted for the grossing-up provisions—from his dividend against his own liability to income tax and what used to be called the surtax on that dividend. Thus, advance corporation tax is not really a company tax. It is a company and a shareholder tax and to ask to set off development land tax or any other tax, such as capital gains tax and capital allowances, against advance corporation tax is to undermine the imputation system which was introduced by the Conservative Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advance corporation tax is almost like a dividend withholding tax and therefore the complications would be enormous. Pension funds, for instance, would receive their dividends tax free and could recover advance corporation tax if they had dividends against which the advance corporation tax which had been set off against development land tax. That would create enormous problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representations are made from time to time that capital allowances should be set off against advance corporation tax. The reasons that it is not allowed are the same as the reasons here. Advance corporation tax is not corporation tax. It is a tax, in effect, on the shareholder. He gets credit for it and to allow development land tax to be set off against it would go against the whole principle of the imputation system we have for taxing companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not put that forward as a complete answer, but we are talking about two different things and I do not think we can accept an amendment which seeks to reduce the advance corporation tax by the amount of development land tax. The surplus advance corporation tax can be carried forward from year to year and set against any future corporation tax. But if there are no future profits the surplus can continue year after year without being relieved, but that is the nature of the beast. It is the fault not of development land tax but of the nature of the imputation system which we have adopted as our corporation tax system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment. It goes against, not the principle of DLT, but the corporation tax system. If we were to allow this tax
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1263</span>
to be set off against advance corporation tax there is no reason why capital gains tax should not be set off against it, capital allowances or any other liability which a company might have. We should be returning to the pre-1965 taxation system for companies, which the right hon. Gentleman may remember was condemned by the Public Accounts Committee. The pre-1965 position was that investment allowances could be set off against a company's income tax liability—at that time it was income tax and profits tax. There was considerable abuse and, indeed, considerable confusion, because exempt bodies, such as pension funds, were able to claim all sorts of reliefs to which they were not entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Public Accounts Committee rightly condemned the pure imputation system and said that we should not go back to it. There was a change to the classical system, and then the Tory Party changed to the normal imputation system, which we have at the moment. The amendment would have considerable ramifications for the whole basis, principle and philosophy behind the corporation tax system. For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that anybody reading this debate in the 	<i>Official Report</i> will think that we are quite crazy. The Minister has just said that advance corporation tax is not corporation tax. In theory, that may be right. But here we are setting up a completely new tax—albeit it is called a tax; it may well be a levy. We on this side of the Committee are seeking to relieve as far as possible the effect of this tax preventing development. It is a tax on development, and we seek in every way to relieve the restraint on development which it will cause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a company is paying advance corporation tax and it has a credit in hand, is that credit to be severely restricted to a credit for shareholders, as the Minister said, set off against the shareholders' tax on dividends, and never to be used for anything else? It is a credit in the hands of the Exchequer. I should have thought that it should have been used to believe the pressure which development land tax will cause on development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister coined the phrase "the pure imputation system". Earlier in these debates we talked about pure
	<span class='label label-info column'>1264</span>
virginity or unimpaired virginity, and now have a pure imputation system. He said that the complications would be enormous, as shown by the previous system, when there were exempt bodies, such as unit trusts, and that the complications, if we applied it now, would be immense. The Minister has resisted the exemptions to these kinds of bodies in previous debates, so it might be simplified in future if we did not have those bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is a credit in the hands of the Government. Why should it not be used to relieve the payment of the DLT? We must look for occasions when the harmful effect of the development land tax can be relieved. By "the harmful effect", I mean the deterrent which it will present to anybody in development. If he has a credit, why cannot he use that credit against development land tax?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I do not think much needs to be said in support of Amendment No. 217 because its virtue is self-evident, if I may bring another concept into out debate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are all concerned with the time limits for obtaining interaction relief due, while charge to another tax precedes development land tax. The existing rule both for Part II, which deals with capital gains tax disposal and trading disposals and Part III, which deals with capital transfer tax and estate duty, is that the DLT disposal has to occur within six years of liability to the other tax for relief to be obtained. In other words, relief is denied if the two occasions are more than six years apart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has argued for a longer period, as do the amendments, and I think there is a case here—to show that I am a warmhearted Treasury Minister—for extending the period at least in relation to CGT and capital transfer tax. I choose my words carefully. As far as those taxes are concerned, and trading disposals, too, there is a case for extending the period from six to 12 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The six-year period was chosen because the further back one goes the more difficult it is to get details of transactions. But 12 years would be a not too unreasonable period, although hon. Members must appreciate that this will lead to some complications, some delay and difficulties. There can be many transactions in land within a period of 12 years and they will all have to be traced back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Be that as it may, for the purpose of capital gains tax and capital transfer tax the 12-year period would be in order. Perhaps I may enter a 	<i>caveat.</i> I do not wish my words to be misunderstood. There is a particular problem in relation to estate duty. I do not want to go into it and I hope hon. Gentlemen will not raise this as an argument against me, but, for estate duty purposes, I do not feel that I can accept the 12-year period. This may be anomalous and illogical, but there are considerable complications. Estate duty was changed considerably in 1969 and does not now exist. But I am prepared to meet right hon. and hon. Gentlemen in respect of capital gains
	<span class='label label-info column'>1266</span>
tax, capital transfer tax and trading disposals within a period of 12 years. But it does not apply to estate duty for reasons I have not outlined but which I assure the Committee are good.

I kept my remarks brief at the outset in the hope that we should have a favourable response, and we greatly welcome that response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 217 leaves out a number of words which remove a time limit altogether, and that we would have preferred, but I will not quibble too much now that the Minister has agreed that, for the purposes he mentioned, a 12-year period can be built into the Bill. Although I regret that it is not possible and it would be inconsistent, to have a similar provision for estate duty, I accept that there are differences, and now that estate duty has been superseded this will be a diminishing problem in the future.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 388, in page 116, line 9, leave out paragraph (	<i>d</i>) and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(	<i>d</i>) the amount of the development land tax would be reduced'.</p></blockquote>
Page 116 of the Bill gives the conditions in which credit can be claimed for other tax which has been paid. We are dealing with the same situation as in the previous amendment, where disposals for other purposes precede a development land tax disposal, and a set-off is available to the taxpayer for tax on those previous chargeable occasions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under some circumstances the onus for establishing the set-off should lie with the Revenue and not with the taxpayer. In the case of capital gains tax, the alternative charge basis under Schedule 21 of the Finance Act 1965 provides that the Revenue does the calculation. Why cannot that also be done here? In a case where another kind of disposal, on which a different kind of tax has been paid, precedes a development land tax disposal, the difficulties of the calculation are likely to be as great, if not greater, than those involving capital gains tax. Therefore, the amendment seeks to provide that it should be the board which has the task of doing the work to establish what the offset may be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Great difficulty could be caused to taxpayers who are faced with development land tax whose normal way of business is not development or building. They are not likely to be practised in the ways of development land tax. They are not likely to understand the complexities of this legislation. It is they who need the protection. The larger companies or professional developers or builders will probably have the expertise available to them. They can afford to consult professional advisers about the interaction of taxes. But the average taxpayer, faced with the possibility of relieving part of his development land tax because of a previous payment of tax on a disposal for another purpose at an earlier stage, and faced with this or anything like it, no matter how many explanatory booklets may by then be available, no doubt with a whole lot of qualifying notes as well, will scarcely begin to understand what is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1268</span>
We therefore feel that, as a matter of principle, whether or not the exact form of the amendment is suitable for achieving it, in those circumstances it should be the Board which does the work of making the calculation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) seeks to make the Board of Inland Revenue, or the Mandarins of Middlesborough, do the work instead of making the taxpayer claim his relief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Why not?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: "Why not?" the hon. Gentleman says. But of course, in another place or in another Chamber the Opposition will argue that the public sector borrowing requirement is too high. The more obligations that we impose upon the Board of Inland Revenue, as indeed upon other Government Departments, the more public expenditure this will mean. However, that is not the main reason why I object to the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman says, the amendment seeks to put the work on the Board and to provide that the taxpayer does not have to claim his relief. This goes against the general principle of our fiscal legislation, that if there is a relief to be claimed, the taxpayer claims it. He puts in his claim for relief and the Board or the inspector then decides whether to give the relief. I think that that is a better system than to expect even the mandarins of Middlesbrough—and I shall show in a moment that it would not in fact be the mandarins of Middlesbrough—with all their sophistication in these matters to decide that a taxpayer should have relief when they really do not know the full circumstances of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the amendment would not achieve its aim because the Inland Revenue would not be able to give interaction relief unless the taxpayer told it of the other tax liability. The reason for that is that the other tax will have been dealt with either by the local inspector of taxes or, in the case of estate duty or capital transfer tax, by the Estate Duty Office. The DLT on the other hand will be dealt with in Middlesbrough, as we know. The claim would be in respect of another tax, which would have been dealt with elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances, think that it is only fair and reasonable that the taxpayer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1249">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1269</span>
should put in the claim. He does not have to put in a terribly detailed claim. He has to put in a claim for relief in respect of a tax. The Board will then have to do the work and decide whether it accepts that claim. If it is not accepted, the taxpayer may retort with his own argument and give a more detailed account. In practice, I think that that is probably a sensible way of operating. Indeed, our tax system imposes a great burden upon the Board of Inland Revenue, quite different from other countries. In other countries, taxpayers have to show far more when they claim relief. In the United States of America, for instance, people have to claim their allowances. In West Germany they have to claim their allowances even on income tax. In this country, we impose great obligations upon the Board of Inland Revenue to do this kind of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When it comes to taxes of this kind, however, I think that this is probably the best way. People claim their relief for losses. They claim the relief for capital allowances. They claim relief for other taxes. At the end of the day, I do not think that it makes all that much difference, but I think that administratively it is better for the initial claim to be made by the individual taxpayer. The Board of Inland Revenue will then compute the claim and agree or disagree, and the matter will be decided accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has based at least part of his argument for rejecting the amendment on the ground that it breaks precedent with previous tax practices. However, the whole tax breaks precedent—first, in the way that we discussed earlier, as a totally new concept in taxation, and because, as I have said, at least part of it is a tax on nothing—but, secondly, and much more important in the context of the amendment, because the computation of tax will be for many individuals a far more complex matter than for any other kind of taxation at present on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister laughs. He is right to laugh and say "No" to himself. He knows, as we all know, that to decide whether to put tax against tax, value against value, value against tax—the whole spectrum of complexities which exist on this schedule—in computing
	<span class='label label-info column'>1270</span>
what is and is not allowable, will be immensely complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is to stick on his argument, in which I see some force, that as so many different Departments are involved it would be very difficult for one Department to have responsibility for computing the entire liability, why can he not reconsider a concession by allowing individuals to set the cost of computing the tax against the tax? We have had this put in debating Schedule 2. I am sure he accepts that it will in many cases be an immensely complicated matter to work out the tax situation. If he is not prepared for the Board to accept responsibility to compute this—and I can understand the second part of his argument—would he not at least reconsider allowing some element of the cost to the individual, in the form of accounting devices and so on, against the tax? Would he, therefore, while denying us this amendment, reconsider his views on Schedule 2?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to continue the debate on whether the cost of computing tax liability should be deductible in computing tax liability. That is a large question and is not confined to development land tax. The principle has always been accepted that, if Parliament imposes an obligation on individuals, the cost of carrying out that obligation should not be allowed in computing the obligation itself. That has been a principle in relation to many taxes, not only development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, the individual will not have to enter into a detailed computation. If he has the staff to do so, he can. But often he will know that he has paid some other tax, and he will not be backward in writing in to Middlesbrough or anywhere else to claim relief for that other tax. He will give himself the benefit of the doubt. I do not think that he will spend a long time carrying out a computation. Then it will be for the Inland Revenue, as so often happens, to work it out and decide whether he should be allowed the exemption. In practice, I think it will work out reasonably between them, and most of the work will probably be done by the Inland Revenue anyway, except in the case of very large companies which will have their own staff to do this kind of work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that this is an unreasonable arrangement, or that it imposes too great a burden. I accept that the Bill is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1250">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<br><blockquote><p>'(	<i>bb</i>) in paragraph 10(1)(	<i>a</i>) for the words "a chargeable gain accrues to any person on a CGT disposal" there shall be substituted the words "there is a trading disposal".'</p></blockquote>
As you have kindly indicated, Mr. Costain, this amendment follows Amendment No. 389, which is an Opposition amendment. I have "accept in principle" on the Opposition amendment, but as I am also told that there is a drafting defect and that Ministers can table an amendment on Report to deal with the point. We have the amendment now, however, and that is Amendment No. 430. I give full credit to the Opposition for finding a drafting defect by means of their Amendment No. 389.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 389 refers to "a profit or gain" accruing on a trading disposal. I am advised that that is not apt. The receipts for the disposal are brought into account in computing the profits or gains of the trade but it is not right to say that a trading profit or gain accrues on a particular item which is part of the trader's general pattern of business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment corrects paragraph 17 of Schedule 6. This paragraph provides for relief to be claimed where there is a trading disposal of an interest in land which is not a DLT disposal. The example given is of transfer from trading stock to the capital account of a business. It is not unusual for trading stock to be moved out of trading stock into capital account and within six years of that trading disposal the interest in land is subject to DLT disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment provides that that kind of situation is met. There was a small drafting defect in Amendment No. 389. I hope that Government Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>1272</span>
No. 430 puts that right, but we are grateful to the Opposition for drawing our attention to this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

But I do not want to labour that point. I am delighted that the Minister took it upon himself to have a suitable and correctly worded amendment tabled and to you, Mr. Costain, for having arranged for it to be moved tonight.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment is properly considered, as you have indicated, Mr. Costain, with Amendment No. 424. We are dealing here with Part III of Schedule 6 which is headed
	<br><blockquote><p>Liability for capital transfer tax or estate duty"</p></blockquote>
when that
	<br><blockquote><p>"precedes charge to development land tax".</p></blockquote>
We are considering the interaction of what is known as a primary capital transfer tax or estate duty tax disposal with a development land tax disposal, that is, where the development land tax disposal follows a gift or a death and has so incurred one of these other two taxes. The taxpayer who is chargeable to development land tax has available to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1251">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1273</span>
him something which is described as a capital transfer tax deduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this point the Bill goes against the principle of allowing value against value. In essence, what is happening here is that of the total value of the gain which is being taxed, a part goes in capital transfer tax or estate duty. The remainder is taxable to development land tax. So here we are having an offset of tax against value, not a division of value between two taxes, and that is out of accord with the other fundamental principles of the offset of taxes within Schedule 6.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are seeking, by Amendment No. 423, to change the definition of "the relevant amount of tax" to that which is set out on the Amendment Paper. I am aware that this is not a precise way of allowing an offset of value against value. I move the amendment, partly to raise this point because I think there is, in a sense, an injustice in the method of interaction of taxes within the Bill in that this does not follow the purity of the other relationships of the taxes in Schedule 6, and is partly because it is disadvantageous to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of Amendment No. 423 would be to gross up the amount of capital transfer tax paid at the relevant development land tax rates. Although this is not a precise way of dealing with the offset of value against value, it would at least go some way towards that principle. The amount of capital transfer tax paid on the primary capital transfer tax disposal is deducted in the computation of the realised development value at that later stage when development land tax falls to be charged. So this is one way in which the taxpayer could be relieved not solely of tax against value, but the situation could be improved to his advantage in a way not precise, but more in accord with the other principles of Schedule 6.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has clearly and ably set out the reasons for this amendment in a very complicated area. Part II of Schedule 6 deals with taxes on profits—taxes on income—and the treatment there is that those taxes are given credit relief, whereas in Part III we deal with capital transfer tax on estate
	<span class='label label-info column'>1274</span>
duty where the relief is more a cost of acquisition relief than a credit relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The treatment differs between Part II and Part III because the taxes are different in nature. As I said, the taxes in Part II are taxes on profits and gains, and the tax in Part III is a tax on value and on transfers of wealth from one person to another. I am advised that the allowance of the relevant amount of capital transfer tax or estate duty as a deduction from the chargeable realised development value has the broad effect of treating that amount as an acquisition cost but has the advantage of not interfering with the base values. The Inland Revenue intended this to be a generous treatment and the taxpayer is better off by this treatment than if the Part II treatment were followed. I recognise that there could be different arguments about this, but at least I hope I have been able to tell the Committee why there is this difference between Part II and Part III. The taxes are different. One is a tax on profits, where the credit system is a better way of dealing with it, but in Part III there is a tax on value or wealth, where the cost of acquisition treatment is considered to be better. We think that is a more generous way of dealing with it than the way proposed in the amendment. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not press the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have said that my amendment was in large part a probing amendment, because it is difficult to establish the underlying principles. I did some calculations and I came to much the same conclusion as the Minister, that there could be cases in which it might be more favourable as set out. On the other hand, it seemed to go against the principles of Part II. Therefore, it is right that we should have on the record the thinking which led to the proposals in this form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 278, in page 125, line 10, leave out from 'shall' to the end of line 15 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'be that proportion of the tax chargeable as the value of the relevant interests bears to the value of the gift for the purposes of capital transfer tax'.</p></blockquote>

I should like to amend slightly the wording, because it has gone a little awry. It should read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"be such proportion of the tax chargeable as the value of the relevant interest"—</p></blockquote>
without an 's'—
	<br><blockquote><p>"bears to the value of the gift for the purpose of capital transfer tax".</p></blockquote>
The Government will not be surprised that an amendment of this kind has been tabled, since I believe that the Law Society communicated the matter to them. The amendment relates to the set-off of capital transfer tax against chargeable realised development value on later development land tax disposal after a gift, in the same way that we were debating in the last amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Law Society pointed out, it is logical to exclude tax on tax on lifetime transfers, but there are doubts about whether the formula, as set out on page 88 of the Inland Revenue's explanatory notes, is exactly right. In the case of a lifetime transfer, the question is whether the correct figure to relieve should not be that proportion of the total tax payable which the value of the gifted land bears to the total gift. That, presumably, is the way in which the relief operates on death. I shall be grateful to have the Minister's comments on this matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, this amendment originated from the Law Society, and the reason for the amendment and the Law Society's concern is that there is an error in the Explanatory Memorandum. The Bill is quite right, but the Explanatory Memorandum is not correct. I hate to chastise a body such as the Law Society, but perhaps it has simply read the Explanatory Memorandum, and not the Bill. As a member of the Bar, I have never fallen into that trap. I have always avoided reading explanatory memoranda. That is why it has hardly been open during the course of these proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without being disrespectful to the right hon. Gentleman, possibly some members of the Law Society do not always go as far as to read the Bill. Let that be a lesson—that sometimes explanatory memoranda are not correct. The reason for the amendment is that the Explanatory Memorandum is not correct, but, in fact, the Bill achieves the right result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is also defective in that by simply comparing the value of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1276</span>
interest in land and the value of the gift it fails to take account of any reduction in the tax attributable to particular property. However, I shall not chastise the Law Society for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the amendment is unnecessary. It is our fault for getting the Explanatory Memorandum wrong, but the Bill achieves the right result. With that explanation, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will fell able to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that we have on record the Minister's comments on this matter. We have desisted, I hope, with the wishes of yourself, Mr. Costain, and the Committee from tabling amendments to the explanatory notes. Although they may not have been open in front of the Minister of State, I suspect that anybody else, whether on the Conservative side of the Committee or yourself, who has had concern with this may have had to open them. I am glad that we have put the record straight on this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 279, in page 129, line 29, after 'transfer' insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or account would have been so taken if paragraph 18(3)(	<i>b</i>) were satisfied'.</p></blockquote>
We are still dealing with cases where a capital transfer tax disposal is followed by a development land tax charge. But in this case we are dealing with the problem of capital transfer tax being charged at the higher rate because of a death rather than a lifetime gift. Paragraph 18(3)(	<i>b</i>) of Schedule 6, on page 124, relates to the person by whom the relevant interest was acquired bearing some or all of the capital transfer tax chargeable on the value transferred by the primary capital transfer tax transfer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By virtue of this definition, we have a problem on a sale at under value. If the donor bears the tax and dies within three years, the donee will have an extra tax to pay. It seems only right that under such circumstances the donee and not the donor should have some relief for the extra tax which would be imposed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point in this amendment.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1253">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1277</span>
Therefore, I am prepared to recommend the Committee to accept it in principle. However, some further drafting changes may be needed towards the end of the paragraph and suitable amendments will be brought forward on Report. Therefore, rather than accept the amendment as it stands, I will accept it in principle and bring forward amendments on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted that the Minister's heart is warming again. In view of his remarks I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 280, in page 130, line 30, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) In any case where the disposal as a result of which the relevant interest was acquired as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1)(	<i>a</i>) above would, had it occurred after the appointed day, have been a DLT disposal so that the condition in subparagraph 1(	<i>c</i>) above is not fulfilled but the consideration for that acquisition was less than that which the relevant interest might reasonably have been expected to fetch in the open market then, for the purposes of this part of the Schedule (other than this sub-paragraph) the condition in sub-paragraph (1)(	<i>c</i>) above shall be taken to be fulfilled.'.</p></blockquote>
I shall not move this amendment at length as I have reason to believe that the Government may be sympathetic towards it. It relates to a situation where estate duty might have been paid on a sale within a period of seven years of death as an under value, because to the extent of that under value it would constitute a gift. Therefore, it seems that an equivalent position to that of paragraph 18(3)(	<i>b</i>) is
	<span class='label label-info column'>1278</span>
needed here. It should treat relief as if it were treated for the purposes of the Bill as a gift.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the amendment is defective. It comes from the Law Society, but it had a better shot at this one. It is defective in drafting in that it refers to the relevant interest, whereas the term used in the context of estate duty interaction relief is "material interest". Despite that defect, I am prepared to recommend that the Committee should accept the principle of the amendment and we will bring forward a proper amendment on Report. I hope the Committee will feel that the principle can be accepted and the amendment withdrawn.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am again grateful to the Minister for what he has said, and for bearing with me on so many points throughout the afternoon and evening. We have made a great deal of progress and I am grateful to him.

I must say that he has done a hatchet job on the wording of some of these Opposition amendments, but at least they have raised a number of important points right up to the end. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
