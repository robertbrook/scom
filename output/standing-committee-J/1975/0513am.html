	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 428, in page 38, line 37, after 'equal', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'subject to subsection (7A) below'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 429, in page 38, line 40, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7A) The amount of realised development value which is treated as accruing to a body under subsection (7) above shall not exceed the market value of the property (if any) which—
	<ol>
	<li>is held by that body immediately before the time at which it ceases to be a charity, and</li>
	<li>is not immediately after that time held for charitable purposes by another body,</li></ol>
and for the purposes of this subsection section 7(1) of this Act shall apply in relation to the market value of any property other than an interest in land as it applies in relation to the market value of an interest in land'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can now go into a little more detail on these amendments, which we were discussing when the Committee adjourned yesterday, particularly in relation to Clause 23 (7). The committee will recollect that I put the amendments in yesterday and there was no time for adequate discussion and debate then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments are to limit the existing charge under subsection (7). The first amendment is introductory and the second—which is the main substantive amendment—is to limit the amount of the realised development value chargeable under subsection (7) to the market value of the property held by the body in question at the time it ceases to be a charity. Furthermore, any of the property which continues to be held for a charitable purpose, but by some other body, is to be disregarded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 27 (3) is aimed at the avoidance of tax by the use of what are known as "time charities ", that is, bodies which are
	<span class='label label-info column'>1164</span>
charitable for a period of time and then cease to be so. Subsection (7) provides that, where the disposal of an interest by a charity is exempt under the clause, and the charity subsequently loses its charitable status, an amount of realised development value equal to the amount which was exempt on the disposal is treated as accruing to the former charity immediately after its loss of charitable status, and so is taxable. When the charity loses its charitable status, there is again a trigger, and the amount that would have been payable if it had not been a charity becomes payable. The rule in the subsection, however, bites no matter how long before the loss of charitable status the exempt disposal occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments meet the criticism made by the churches Main Committee and the National Council for Social Services, which have pointed out two areas in which subsection (7) could affect charities which are not strictly time charities. The first is where the charity has disposed of all its funds for charitable purposes and is then wound up. That charity may not be a time charity; it may be a normal charity which is then wound-up. If, during its life, the charity has made one or more exempt disposals, the trustees will find themselves faced with a DLT liability and no funds to meet it, they all having been spent on perfectly respectable and honourable purposes. That is the first case which the amendments are designed to meet—the genuine case where the charity is wound-up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second case which the amendments are designed to meet is where a charity ceases to exist on merging with another. Here, too, subsection (7) by itself, as drafted, would impose liability if there had been previous exempt disposals. The Charity Commissioners, while acknowledging the need to prevent avoidance by the use of time charities, make the same points in relation to that kind of situation. So we have attempted, in the amendments, to meet these two particular difficulties, in the case of genuine charities being wound-up and in the case of one charity merging with another, where in neither case is there a time charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I undertook yesterday to ensure that the 	<i>cy-près</i> doctrine was taken into account, and I shall let the Committee know whether that is the case. I expect it would be, and, indeed, it probably should be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1165</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I suppose it would be a foolish thing to say in relation to charities that we must not look a gift horse in the mouth. At least, the amendments are some concession. I want to see whether I understand it correctly, and I hope that my questions will make clear to the Committee what the concession is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the second case, which relates to a merger, is quite clear. If the property goes over to another charity and is still used for charitable purposes, clearly the tax should not bite. But in the first case, which relates to the disposal of funds when a charity is wound-up, if the amendments are accepted, as I understand it the market value at that time would be taken as the base. It would not be necessary to go back to the acquisition date of the property and find the difference between the value at that time and the value at which it is being assumed to be disposed of when the charity is wound-up. If that is the case, if we are starting with the market value on the date of cessation as the base, I should have thought we could have done without Clause 23 altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems to me that unless the charity fails to realise the property fairly speedily, there is likely to be no charge, so why bother about the clause at all? If this really is such a substantial concession, I am extremely grateful, but I should have thought it would have been quite clear to wipe the clause out and leave it at that. Clearly, the charity will try to dispose of the property quickly; it may happen that there is a windfall increase in value between the date of cessation of the charity and the date of the disposal of the property, but I think that would be most unusual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is one small drafting problem, that is, the date of cessation of the charity. I suppose the position might be that the charity passes a resolution to wind itself up, or to cease to be a charity or to become some other type of body. It would then proceed to the administration of that winding-up, and, finally, the proceeds of the sale of the assets would be distributed. I think it will be a little difficult, without some further identification of the date, to know exactly when the property is disposed of. If it is only treated as ceasing to be charitable at the time it is sold or otherwise disposed of, then I come back to my point that the clause is really unneceassry because there
	<span class='label label-info column'>1166</span>
would be no difference between the market value on one day and the market value on that same day. It seems to me that the clause could be removed altogether. I hope I have understood the position; perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has invariably understood the position very well. I thought along the same lines as he did regarding the desirability of having subsection (7) at all in view of these amendments, but I think the answer to his point is that they put an upper limit, as he realises, on the realised development value on the winding-up of the charity. In other words, the upper limit is the market value at that point in time. I would suppose that people who enter into transactions for the purpose of setting up time charities would not benefit very much under that kind of provision, because of their original intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of an upper limit at the point of time when the charity ceased to be a charity, in the case of a specifically designed time charity would still penalise it without penalising the genuine case where there is no intention to wind-up the charity for tax avoidance purposes. I am advised that, by this new subsection, a genuine charity will be assisted but that people who deliberately set up time charities will still not benefit, because they are in a different business, as it were. They will still be taxable despite the subparagraph.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the Minister will wish to correct the record where he is saying, in effect, that a time charity is not a genuine charity. There may be a collection of funds for a disaster, for example, which is very much a charity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is quite right. I meant a time charity that is set up for the purpose of getting the benefit of this kind of exemption and then ceases to be a charity. We do not want to chase genuine charities, but we want to prevent avoidance in those cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me when a charity ceased to be a charity. I do not really know, and I do not know whether one can frame more exact rules to deal with that kind of situation. At the end of the day, the matter will have to be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1167</span>
decided as a question of fact in the circumstances, as often happens with companies—though I accept that the problem for companies will not be so great. But it is better to be more flexible and to let the matter be decided in accordance with the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 429, in page 38, line 40, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(7A) The amount of realised development value which is treated as accruing to a body under subsection (7) above shall not exceed the market value of the property (if any) which—
	<ol>
	<li>is held by that body immediately before the time at which it ceases to be a charity, and</li>
	<li>is not immediately after that time held for charitable purposes by another body,</li></ol>
and for the purposes of this subsection section 7(1) of this Act shall apply in relation to the market value of any property other than an interest in land as it applies in relation to the market value of an interest in land'.—[	<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That Clause 23, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have three cases to put on Clause 23. The first is a point which I do not think we dealt with specifically on the amendments—the extension of a lease held by a charity. It would be advisable to consider at a later stage a possible amendment to state that the extension of a lease held by a charity does not amount to a disposal. That is putting it rather badly, perhaps—it may need some qualifications. I have missed some point in the Bill where provision for this is made. But it would be unfortunate if a charity, holding its property as leasehold, had an opportunity to extend that lease and found that it was caught in some way by these provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point is one that I ought to correct myself. When we were dealing with an earlier amendment, and I had been talking about companies of which the shareholders are all charities, the Minister rightly said that the normal investment type of organisation was not a limited company. I have now in my hands a document of the Charities Property Unit Trust. I recollect that the Minister was advised while he was speaking that unit trusts were quite different from companies. Of course they are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But this unit trust was established by a trust deed in 1967 to enable charities to invest in real property on a co-operative basis. It follows the model of a unit trust
	<span class='label label-info column'>1168</span>
for securities. There is no management company and all the benefits accrue to the unit holders. In this case, membership is restricted to charities which are recognised as such for taxation purposes by the Inland Revenue, and which apply their income and gains for charitable purposes only. It is limited to charities whose total funds invested or available for investment exceed £25,000. It is a body for channelling investments—substantial investments—by charities in real property. The trust is managed by an elected committee of management, and the point that I want to stress is that the Inland Revenue has confirmed that the trust is exempt from both capital gains tax and corporation tax. The income suffers tax under the ordinary income tax liabilities, but member funds are able to reclaim the tax deducted from distributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a body which holds real property in that it invests the charities money in real property, and it is recognised as being free from taxes similar to the tax imposed by the Bill. I would ask that it be confirmed that this trust will not be subject to development land tax, or if, as the Bill stands, it is subject to that tax, that we should have an amendment to Clause 24 to give it the same benefit as charities are to have under that clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here is something which clearly shows that in the rest of tax law charities are relieved of tax. Whether, as in this case, the investing trust is the object of the relief, or whether the beneficiaries from that trust can reclaim the tax which the trust has paid, I do not mind, but it shows that when there are investments for charitable purposes, not only is the revenue from that free of tax, but also any increase in gains of capital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This leads me to my third point. The government should state clearly whether the Bill is a precedent for taxing charities. How do the Government distinguish development land tax from the other taxes, both on revenue and on capital, which are not suffered by charities? The Committee, and eventually the House and eventually the public, should know whether this is to be a precedent for charging tax to charities. If it is, it will destroy—and I use that word deliberately—many charities in this country. If it is not to be a precedent, how do the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1169</span>
Government distinguish it from those taxes from which charities are now free?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to support what my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has said about the Charities Property Unit Trust. This vehicle for charity investment has a number of advantages, including the charities like the one to which I have referred, of which I am a trustee and which has substantial investments of its own in property. It is a vehicle through which charities which own a great deal of shop property, which is a common investment of charities because of the handy-size packages it comes in, can invest in industrial and agricultural property as well. The Minister will be aware that the provision of charitable funds for investment in those fields—no pun is intended about agriculture—is helpful to the productive operations of industry and agriculture in providing useful funds for those purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I should like to return to a comment by the Minister when we were discussing church schools. The Minister said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there is a movement out of that community to another place, in the medium-term future there may be a problem. It is not a problem in the short term, and perhaps not even in the medium term."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 	<i>Standing Committee J,</i> 12th May 1976; c. 1148.]</p></blockquote>
In that statement he was recognising, as he had earlier, that the Government's proposals to introduce the taxation of charities for the first time, will, as my right hon. Friend has pointed out, create a problem, if not in the short term, at least in the medium term, and certainly a growing problem in the long term.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recognition of this by the Minister seems to me to provide an indication to the Opposition that we ought to look again at some of the amendments which have not been accepted by the Minister. He has occasionally tried to be helpful, but I cannot say that we have progressed far in our attempts to alleviate the damage that this tax will do to charities. We must look again at those amendments to see whether we can find something which will deal with the problem that the Minister himself has recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that any of my right hon. or hon. Friends are very pleased at the progress that we have made on Clause 23, even if we had cause for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1170</span>
satisfaction on Clause 19. I would not be entirely satisfied if I helped the tourist trade and the retail trade but failed to help charities. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will be able to return to this problem and see whether we can devise a formula to meet the medium and long-term problem that he himself has recognised. We shall return to this matter at all the later stages of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I echo the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury). We are indeed thankful for small mercies, but they are very small. We have made some progress and I hope that before the Bill is enacted we shall make some more, but I want to raise one general point which came out very clearly in what the Minister of Sate said yesterday evening about some of the subsections of Clause 23.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had an amendment removing subsection (6) because the type of situation which it was designed to catch was, as I understand it, already covered by subsection (7), and therefore subsection (6) was not necessary. That is logical and right and we are glad that subsection (6) has been removed. But it took into account a considerable range of other situations which are not covered by subsection (7). In the Bill as it stood, an anti-avoidance subsection was included in order to deal with a fairly narrow possibility of avoidance, but with it it carried implications for a whole lot of other situations which the Government had not intended to tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we were discussing the position of groups of companies in Clause 21 and the arrangements for de-grouping, we came across exactly similar problems. I hope you will not think me out of order, Mr. Costain, if I refer very briefly to this because it demonstrates the point and the difference in the Government's approach. Because these are charities and this is a sensitive issue, the Government have thought very carefully about how wide the net should be spread, and they have come to the conclusion that only the particular anti-avoidance situation which is covered by subsection (7) needs to be in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But where we have groups of companies, as the Minister of State admitted yesterday, the exemptions are very narrow
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1171</span>
because, if they were widened at all, they might conceivably let through some anti-avoidance situations which the Revenue does not want to permit. As I tried to point out at that time, the anti-avoidance provisions with regard to groups of companies and de-grouping were drawn much wider and they would carry with them implications which would affect 	<i>bona fide</i> transactions which surely the Revenue and the Government do not wish to inhibit. Therefore, I should like to highlight the difference in the treatment for charities and companies and the different attitudes which have arisen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's sensitivity to the needs of charities. The case which has been made by my right hon. and hon. Friends has greatly assisted the Government in reaching a more favourable attitude towards charities and their needs. I do not think it should be left there without a word of protest that the same sort of vigilance and thoughtfulness ought to be applied to other bodies—they may be registered companies or whatever. We may have left situations where we have allowed subsections of clauses to remain in the Bill because their removal might allow the escape of some narrow anti-avoidance situation. While they remain, many other genuine non-avoidance transactions are caught.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I welcome the progress which we have made on Clause 23, I hope that it can be taken further and that the thinking which has led the Government to revise their ideas as to what anti-avoidance provisions should be included in Clause 23 might spread to other areas of this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Douglas Crawford</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to echo what has been said by the Conservative Members on this subject. In spite of the general reputation of the people of my country for meanness, and particularly the people of Aberdeen—I could regale the Committee with many stories about this, but I shall not do so—I believe that the people of Scotland give more to charities 	<i>per capita</i> than the people of England, and with their reputation for canniness they would ensure that the type of charity to which they contribute would be a 	<i>bona fide</i> charity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charities to which the people of my country are contributing may be hit even harder than those to which people south of the border contribute. I echo the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1172</span>
point made by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), who asked the Minister if this was the beginning of the general taxation of charities. Is this the beginning of a blanket taxation of charity? The Government must try to keep their dogma out of this. The Scottish National Party will reserve its position on this matter. Although some concessions have been made, we believe that they are not enough and we should like to look at the situation again at a later stage of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can deal with that last point made by the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford), which was also raised by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page). Again I can say quite clearly, and this must come out in our debate, that there is no intention of extending taxation to charities in general. The reason why the Development Land Tax applies to one particular asset owned by charities, namely investment in land, is because development land tax is part of a scheme which, in the opinion of the Government, is the best way of dealing with a difficult problem. Governments have faced the problem of the peculiarities and difficulties of land for a long time. This is a special tax in relation to land in particular, bearing in mind the provisions of the Community Land Act, and the Government's view that the best way of resolving the recurrent problems of land, and ensuring better planning provision, is to do so through the medium of local Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the basis of the Government's philosophy with which hon. Gentlemen may agree or disagree. Everything else in relation to charities, be it the Community Land Act or the taxation of charities, follows from that point. That is why in respect of land acquired after the 12th September 1974, the charities are subjected to this tax. It is an unusual tax in that it is allied to another policy, namely, the Community Land Act, in trying to solve the difficult problem of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tax does not apply to any other assets and there is no intention of extending taxation, be it income tax, capital gains tax, corporation tax or any other tax, except those indirect taxes which we have imposed on charities for a long time.

case and a special situation because of the difficulty of dealing with the land problem in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has used the argument on several occasions that the money is being taken away from charities and given to the local authorities to carry out the charitable work. That is not true, if I may say so. I do not say that he is a liar but that it is not accurate under either the Bill or the Community Land Act. This tax does not all go to the local authorities. We have no permanent guarantee that the local authorities will have its benefit; it will go into the general funds of the Exchequer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.00 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is under a misconception. Much of this money—80 per cent. of it—will go to local authorities. I gave an example in the Second Reading debate of a simple case of land in any part of the country—if, for example, the local authority should require to build a school upon it. That has nothing to do with the Community Land Act. That land, if it is required by the local authority, will be acquired at the cost roughly of 20 per cent.—I am not being accurate because there is a £10,000 relief and a sixty-six and two-thirds slice—whereas, if the provisions of the Bill were not passed, the land would cost 100 per cent. That is a case where the money will not go to central Government: the whole of that benefit will go to the local authority which will buy net of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely the point that, when we come to the regime of the Community Land Act, in certain situations there are proposals for pooling part of the gain and for splitting it between local and central Government and other depressed areas. But there are many cases where a local authority will wish to buy land for a school; if it is buying that land from a local farmer, it will buy net of tax at 20 per cent. or so. If the right hon. Gentleman wanted us to exempt charities completely, it would pay 100 per cent. to the charity for that land. That is the kind of situation that would happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We say that, bearing in mind the philosophy and the principle behind the legislation, it is the local community which should benefit in the main. We do
	<span class='label label-info column'>1174</span>
not see why in that kind of case, if a charity makes an investment in land, as many of them do, a local authority should have to pay 100 per cent. to the charity and pay only the 20 per cent., as it were, to the local farmer. That is a simplified example, but it shows that the benefit will not go in all cases to the central Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the other points raised by the right hon. Gentleman. He asked about the extension of the lease. If one lease is disposed of and another lease acquired in relation to land, and the new lease is acquired and the old lease is disposed of after 12th September 1974, that, so far as the new lease is concerned, and any further disposal of the new lease, would be a post-White Paper Day asset and will come within the legislation. Clearly, it will depend a lot on the terms of the lease and what is meant by the extension of the lease, but if a new lease is acquired after 12th September 1974, and then sometime in the future that new lease is disposed of at development value, the charity will not receive the benefit in that case of the exemption for pre-12th September 1974 assets, because it is not a pre-12th September 1974 asset. On the question of an extension of an old lease, I do not know what the terms would be, and I should not like to comment, but if a new lease is acquired and then disposed of after 12th September 1974, the exemption does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman has raised an interesting problem regarding a charitable unit trust, giving the specific example of the Charities Property Unit Trust. As far as I can see, that unit trust is the legal owner and holds the assets on trust for the beneficiaries. I will look into this point because I can see that there are difficulties where all the ownership is in the hands of a charity but the unit trust itself as a body holding the assets is not a charity. At first sight, it would not appear that the unit trust would get the benefits of the exemptions here. Whether the unit trust could be said to be a bare trustee for the charities is something I will not pursue because it is extremely difficult and complicated. I promised yesterday to write to the right hon. Gentleman generally on this point, and in doing so I will try to deal with this point in particular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have dealt with the points raised by the right hon. Gentleman. We
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1175</span>
have no intention of taxing charities in general; in the case of the extension of a lease, it will depend on the circumstances; if a new lease is acquired, it will be taxable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must for one moment come back to the point about where the money goes that is taken from the charities. Of course, if a local authority acquires a charity's property, it acquires as an exempt body and the benefit goes to the local authority. One hopes that the local authority will carry out the charitable work that has been carried out by that charity. There is no guarantee that it will do so. But that will apply to only a minority of cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charity will be disposing of its property elsewhere in order to realise its assets from time to time. If it disposes of its property to someone or some body other than an exempt body, it will pay development land tax to the Exchequer. It depends on what the Exchequer does with that money whether a local authority acquires the benefit of it or in any other way benefits from the fact that the charity has been deprived of the betterment value of its property. It cannot be put as a strong argument that all that we are doing is allowing local authorities to carry out the work which the charity would otherwise be doing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 377, in page 39, line 17, leave out 'or'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this, we are to take Amendment No. 378, in page 39, line 19, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(	<i>c</i>) the income derived from the building or other land forms part of the income of the charity, or is, according to rules or regulations established by Act of Parliament, charter, decree, deed of trust or will, applicable to charitable purposes only or is applicable solely towards the repairs of any cathedral, college, church or chapel or of any building used solely for the purpose of divine worship; or</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1176</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>d</i>) any realised development value would accrue to the charity and is applicable and applied for charitable purposes only'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 377 is a paving amendment to Amendment No. 378. The amendments deal with the definition in Clause 24 of the use for the purpose of a charity. Clause 24(2) reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) For the purposes of this section, a building or other land constitutes property used by a charity if and to the extent that—"</p></blockquote>
and subparagraphs (	<i>a</i>) and 	<i>(b)</i> which follow set out cases when the building or land constitutes property used by a charity:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) it is occupied solely by the charity for its own use; or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>) it is otherwise used solely for carrying out the charitable purposes of the charity;"</p></blockquote>
We think that this definition of use by a charity is too narrow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 378 seeks to extend the definition by providing that property shall be treated as being used by a charity if, and to the extent that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the income derived from the building or other land forms part of the income of the charity,"</p></blockquote>
or if the income is
	<br><blockquote><p>"…applicable to charitable purposes only or is applicable solely towards the repairs of any cathedral, college, church or chapel or of any building used solely for the purpose of divine worship".</p></blockquote>
That may be an abundance of caution on our part. The uses described in the first part of Amendment No. 378 may indeed come within Clause 24(2). But it would be wise to spell it out and if it is not already in the Bill it should be, because we are looking at the charity from a practical point of view—what the asset is of the charity being so used and whether the income from it is part of the income of the charity if the charity is bound by its regulations or the general law to apply the proceeds or income for charitable purposes, and if one includes the matters set out in the amendment as "charitable purposes", the question can be put beyond doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of Amendment No. 378 states that if
	<br><blockquote><p>"any realised development value would accrue to the charity and is applicable and applied for charitable purposes only",</p></blockquote>
the property should be treated as being used by the charity for its charitable purposes. I readily admit that subparagraph (	<i>d</i>) is wide, although it is limited by the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"applied for charitable purposes only".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1201">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1177</span>
For the importance of the amendments, one has to turn back to subsection (1) of Clause 24 to see what Clause 24 is all about. It defers the payment of development land tax which might otherwise become payable if a charity carries out a project of material development. If there is a deemed disposal, the tax shall not be collected from the charity at that point. It shall not be collected while the charity continues to use the building or land as property used by a charity. So the definition in subsection (2) of what is used by a charity is of vital importance. If the property is not used by the charity for the purposes of the charity, the tax is triggered off. If the charity continues to use the property in whole or in part for the purposes of the charity, the tax is deferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the amendments seek to increase the occasions or to be more specific about the occasions when the tax is deferred. We have tried to look at it from the practical point of view of the charities, particularly of the churches which will be affected, and it would make the Bill more valuable to those charitable organisations if the amendments were included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) speaks to his amendments so reasonably and drafts them so ingeniously that it takes a little time to appreciate that they are sometimes not very different from previous amendments in intention and principle. I mean that as praise, not as criticism. I am sure that he recognised while he was speaking that the amendments say nothing different from some of the previous amendments. Amendment No. 378 says that if the income derived from the building or other forms of land is applicable for charitable purposes only, that investment is exempt from development land tax; and that is what the argument has been about. it is not a case of whether the income is applicable for charitable purposes. We have defined
	<br><blockquote><p>"property used by the charity"</p></blockquote>
very narrowly in Clause 24 to confine it to the use of the property itself. However, if one imports the phrase "for charitable purposes only", an investment in a large office block in the centre of London which produces income which is then used for charitable purposes would be exempt from development land tax on any disposal,
	<span class='label label-info column'>1178</span>
provided it was acquired after 12th September 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we are again getting back to the main point: do we want to give an exemption, as the Bill does, merely for the operational land of a charity, or do we want to go further and give it to the investment property of the charity? By accepting the amendments, one would be giving it to the investment property. That is the main substance of my argument against accepting the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should make it clear that a body like Oxfam, which uses its shops for charitable purposes—they are its base of operation—is excluded from the terms of the legislation. So it has nothing to fear from Clause 24 in regard to its operational property. But, of course, an investment by the Church of England in a large shopping centre anywhere in the country will not be considered to be used for the charity in the sense in which Clause 24 is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also some difficulties because Amendment No. 378 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the income derived from the building or other land…is applicable—"</p></blockquote>
for the purposes of the charity. Over what period of time do we determine this? If a week before the property is disposed of the income is used for charitable purposes, is the exemption given? Or does it have to be a longer period? It is extremely difficult to try to marry the one with the other, and I would not know at what point of time this could be done. Anyway, I should not have thought it was practical. But that is not the main objection to the amendment, which is that it still goes to the roots of the principle of the legislation. I respect the right hon. Gentleman's view, but we differ on how charities should be treated. For these reasons, I could not recommend my hon. Friends to vote in favour of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I beg to move Amendment No. 192, in page 42, line 7, after '1960' insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or in Scotland section 360 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970'.</p></blockquote>
This concerns Scotland. The purpose of the amendment—it has the backing of such an eminent body as the Law Society of Scotland—is that in the Bill we should get the right sections relating to Scotland. I am advised that Section 360 is the right one of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 so far as Scotland is concerned, whereas in the Bill there is no mention of it; there is merely a mention of Section 341. I fear that the draftsman must have been a Sassenach and must have been looking only at the English section and not at the Scottish. That is my advice, and I trust I am right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has spoken up for Scotland on this occasion, and indeed on other occasions when he has been concerned about the drafting of legislation in relation to Scotland. I have a note in my brief that this amendment is not necessary. It is not necessary, apparently, because the Bill as drafted will not be in any way detrimental to Scottish charities. The problem arises because Section 13 of the Housing Act 1974 does not necessarily apply to Scotland in respect of housing associations, but I am advised that a Scottish charity can qualify despite that, by another route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am not satisfied that we have dealt with this in the best possible way in the clause, although I am advised that the amendment is unnecessary. Rather than accept the amendment as it is and incorporate it into the Bill at this stage, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman would allow me to consider further whether this is the best way of dealing with the matter. My first view is that it is the best way to deal with it, but rather than accept the amendment now, could I look at it further with a view to incurcorporating an amendment of this kind on Report? I think it would make the clause simpler and clearer, and it would make it absolutely clear that Scotland would be dealt with differently from England under this provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

On that basis, in view of the Minister's assurance that he will look at this aspect again, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That Clause 25 stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 25, to which we have moved only one minor amendment, is an important clause. It deals with the Housing Corporation and certain housing associations. It exempts some and not others. Subsection (1) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Development land tax shall not be chargeable on any realised development value accruing to—</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>a</i>) an approved co-operative housing association, or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>) a self-build society".</p></blockquote>
These are defined later in the clause in subsection (7). Those two bodies are in the privileged position under subsection (1) that
	<br><blockquote><p>"on the deemed disposal of an interest in land by that association or society "</p></blockquote>
no tax will be payable. However, in subsection (2), if a similar sort of body does not come strictly within those definitions, that is to say, if—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>a</i>) the Housing Corporation, or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>b</i>) a registered housing association which is neither an approved co-operative housing association nor a self-build society"</p></blockquote>
does the same thing, that is to say, carries out a project of material development and thereby realises a development value, then the tax is only deferred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Frankly, I cannot see the difference in principle here. We recognise the registered housing associations as having considerable benefit in various sections of the law, both in housing and taxation, and merely to distinguish between a registered housing association and one which is on a co-operative basis seems to have no principle in it at all. It seems to follow from that to ask, if the housing associations are merely to receive the benefit of deferring their tax, and if the tax may be triggered off eventually, as set out in Clause 25, whether we shall get any future development from housing associations. Will it not be far more
	<span class='label label-info column'>1182</span>
useful to them if the local authorities carry out this sort of development?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Housing associations are non-profit-making bodies; that is their whole purpose. They are there to supplement the work of housing carried out by local authorities. They are not there to provide profit for any builder or developer carrying out the provision of houses, but are on exactly the same level as the local authority on a non-profit-making basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If they are to have the tax hanging over their heads, albeit deferred for a period of time but on their accounts for ever, what is the purpose of having a housing association? I am afraid they will all pack up and leave it to the local authorities. I suppose this is what the Government want. We have discussed charities, and the local authorities are far better people to carry out charitable works than charities, according to the Government principle, so I suppose the local authorities are far better people to carry out housing than housing associations, unless it is an approved co-operative housing association. We shall come up against a great many difficulties if the clause remains in the Bill as it is, with a distinction between the co-operative housing association and the "ordinary" housing association or registered housing association.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one matter which arises out of previous discussions. Subsection (5) provides that when property comes out of a housing association or the association ceases to be an association for this purpose, it is a disposal. I think I am right in reading it that way. We removed subsection (6), which was along the same lines, from Clause 23, dealing with charities. I wonder whether we should also either remove or revise subsection (5) of Clause 25.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is incorrect in assuming that the Government are not in favour of housing associations. I would certainly acquit them of that charge at the moment, although they may not have supported housing associations with as much money as the housing corporation would like and as much money as could be used, particularly in those areas where the more obvious evidence of housing stress is perhaps not so apparent but where there are housing problems all the same. The sort of area
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1204">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1183</span>
which I represent may not have what are called "slums" but we still have a large number of elderly people living in rented accommodation, much of which is not very satisfactory by today's standards; and there are some wards with considerable housing problems which are best solved by housing associations, and their work is being to some extent affected by the unavailability of funds. However, I hope that my right hon. Friend is not right in suggesting that the Government are dropping their support, which was only recently enshrined in statute, for housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend, reading subsection (5), asked whether it means that if a housing association ceases to be a registered housing association, that triggers off a deemed disposal. I can envisage circumstances in which a housing association, formed perhaps to provide housing of a particular sort in a defined area carries out that job. After a period of years, because it no longer wishes to have so many trustees but wishes to have professional people on the board who will work for it and thus save it money, it may decide that there is no longer any purpose in being registered. It would simplify matters from every point of view if it ceased to be a registered housing association. Would it, in those circumstances, suddenly find that it had triggered off a deemed disposal? It is not very satisfactory that it should do so. I ask the Minister to look at that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can explain why the clause draws a distinction between approved co-operative housing associations and self-build societies on the one hand, and registered housing associations on the other. The former group is completely exempt. For the latter group, the tax is deferred on the commencement of project material development, but when disposal takes place the tax is paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The complete exemption from development land tax for self-build societies and approved co-operative housing associations is on the footing that these bodies are rather like owner-occupiers. In practice, they are more like a collection of owner-occupiers than a normal housing association which gets the exemption. It would be exceptional for an owner-occupier to be liable to develop-
	<span class='label label-info column'>1184</span>
ment land tax if he put up a house for himself, because of the first £10,000 exempt slice. It was felt, therefore, that it would be right to exempt them completely from the legislation. There was no intention of putting them in a privileged position. They are not in competition with builders in general or with housing associations. That is why we felt that they should be completely exempt, and I am sure that hon. Members would not dissent from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For housing associations in general or housing corporations, we have tried to find a middle course. They do very good work and there is no intention of damaging them. But they are in the business—if "business" is the right word—of putting up houses and disposing of them to the general public. If we were to give them complete exemption, the hon. Gentleman for Melton (Mr. Latham) in particular, would say this is a bit unfair to private builders, who do exactly the same thing. They do it for nasty profit and the housing associations do it from good motives, but they are in the same line of trade and it would be unfair to exempt housing associations completely. So we have tried to find a middle way whereby, on the commencement of the development, they are not charged, partly because their availability of finance may not be the same as that of a private builder. They may find it more difficult to get funds. Therefore, in their case the change does not occur until the actual disposal of the property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the essential difference between the housebuilders of whom my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) often speaks and the housing associations is that in 99 per cent. of the cases, if not 100 per cent., the housing associations provide accommodation for rent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may well be so. But there are builders also who provide accommodation for rent. I agree that the number is diminishing—one of our problems is that private builders do not seem to want to provide houses for rent. But they are still in the same line of business and to some extent competing, so it would not be fair to go all the way and exempt them. They would then dispose of their properties to the public in general. But the approved co-operative
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1205">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1185</span>
housing associations and self-build societies are quite different. They are groups of potential owner-occupiers and we thought it right to exempt them completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked me about subsection (5). I do not think, with respect, that he entirely understood its purpose. I do not criticise him for that—I am reading from my brief. Perhaps I may go back to subsections (3) and (4), which is the background to subsection (5). Subsections (3) and (4) treat actual disposals of interests in land between any of the bodies specified in subsections (1) and (2)—the two kinds to which I have referred—as being for no consideration; that is, as not giving rise to any DLT liability. There is an exception for an unregistered self-build society.

Subsection (5) follows on from that. It provides that, where there has been a previous disposal to which subsection (3) applied, on a subsequent disposal—for example, by the housing association which has received the land—the chargeable person is treated as having the donor's acquisition date, and special addition continues to run from that date. That means that it does not cease to run at the time of the donee's acquisition. The subsection provides that, if there has been a group transfer between two housing associations, special addition does not stop when the second housing association acquires the property. It gives the same kind of relief in respect of special addition as was given to groups of companies. There is no intention of doing damage—indeed, it is a beneficial provision to help transfers between housing associations and the other exempt bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not clear about the distinction—which I think is false—between co-operative housing associations and cost-rent associations. Up to the present, Governments of whatever colour have encouraged both the co-operative and the cost-rent housing associations. There has been a difference in taxation from time to time. Strangely enough, to my recollection the cost-rent associations—what are called in the Bill the registered housing associations—got the benefit of tax when the co-operative housing associations were not permitted it. I am not sure what the position is. In those days, I was a member of the committee of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1186</span>
a housing association and had it all at my fingertips. When we wanted to become a co-operative and not a cost-rent association, we found that the tax position was more difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One ought not, as a matter of broad policy to discourage either type of housing association or encourage one against the other. The Minister should think again about this. I give notice that, when I have read what the Minister said this morning and studied the distinction which he makes, I should like to consider whether we should table an amendment at a later stage to put both kinds of association on the same footing and encourage housing associations as much as we can. When they come to sell the property, a disposal may trigger off tax at that stage. But, as the clause stands, they will have a contingent liability right from the start, which they will have to put on their books, and I do not think that we should hang that stone round the necks of registered housing associations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>DEFERRED LIABILITY FOR DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 178, in page 43, line 21, at end insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'after due allowance has been made for the development land tax on the accrued development value'.</p></blockquote>
I am not entirely sure whether these words will be held in the shorthand of the Minister's brief to be NN—not needed. But the purpose of the amendment—which is, in part, a paving amendment—is to make it clear that the same slice of the development value would not be charged to development land tax twice. I find the wording of this clause a little hard to follow. We have the commendably clear words in the Explanatory Notes, which explain Clause 26(2) in the following terms:
	<br><blockquote><p>"When there is an operative disposal of an interest in land, the chargeable person will be liable to DLT not only in respect of any realised development value accruing on that disposal but also in respect of the DLT deferred from a previous deemed disposal of that interest."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1206">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1187</span>
I should be delighted to hear from The Law Society or from the parliamentary draftsman why those commendably clear words could not have been taken 	<i>en bloc</i> to form the substance of the clause. It is some kind of commentary on the complications we get into in law that words which seem absolutely clear and self-explanatory in the notes become muddied, difficult and about four times as long in the text of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the purpose of the amendment is clear and that we can hear from the Minister either that it is not needed and that he is confident that that will be apparent to more expert lawyers than myself, or alternatively that he accepts it, because clearly it would be inequitable if the same slice of development value were to become charged twice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to reassure the hon. Gentleman that the amendment is not necessary. As he says, the amendment seeks to ensure that advantage is taken of any deferred DLT when there is a subsequent disposal which triggers the charge. Under Clause 7(2), in fact, the value of the right to carry out the project in respect of which liability is deferred goes into current use value when the project commences and tax is charged at that point in time. But once a project starts, the right to carry out that project is moved, as it were, from the previously deemed development value into current use value and so becomes the base for any future disposal, so there can be no question of DLT being charged twice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
DLT liability on the operative disposal over and above the deferred liability will arise only if and to the extent that the land has at the time of that disposal further "hope" value for development. In other words, we have the dual disposal. The tax is computed at that point in time; if there is a further disposal, the tax in respect of a deemed disposal is paid but, of course, the current use value of a project for the purpose of computing any further tax might rise if there has been an increase in development value between the commencement of the project and the disposal. This is governed by two different situations, and there is no question that there will be any double taxation in respect of the same item or element of betterment value. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the amendment is unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 365 adds the important words "if any". I know that it is a minor point, but I wondered why the same words should not be added in page 43, line 40, after "proportion". I am sure that the Opposition would be very happy to accept such an amendment if the Minister wanted to move one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a more substantial point, we have been talking in the previous clause and on other occasions about the triggering off of deferred tax, and it is not clear to me whether the circumstances which trigger off the payment of deferred tax also allow where appropriate—that is, where it would have been allowed for an immediate payment of tax—for the tax to be paid by instalments. It is quite clear from the discussions which we have already had that there would be occasions when the event which triggered off the deferred tax was not an event which was an actual disposal of an interest generating cash to pay tax. I should like the Minister to consider whether anything further is needed to ensure that, when the deferred tax is triggered off, the equivalent right to pay by instalments will be there for the person who has become liable to the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this is an important point. We shall come to further areas where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1207">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1189</span>
deferment is applicable; certainly we run into a lot in Clauses 19 and 25 and in other parts of the Bill. The right to pay by instalments is critical. It is the basis of much criticism, not only from the property profession but also from the Government supporters, of the first letting tax, and it is the basis of a great deal of concern about this legislation and the deemed disposal provisions and the effect that these might have on the industry. I hope that we can have a reassurance from the Minister on this rather fundamental point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As regards the words "if any", I am advised that although they seem harmless, if they were included it would go to the roots of the whole legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to instalments, I take the hon. Gentleman's point. I think that he is saying that, if there is a disposal, at least there will be the money to pay the tax, but if, for instance, the land is used for a non-qualifying purpose in the case of industrial development, the money is not there to pay the tax. Perhaps we can come back to this when we come to Schedule 8(45) which deals with instalments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I feel that this amendment originated from his earlier complaints in previous amendments supported by the Law Society for Scotland. I went through its helpful brief myself. Unfortunately, I did not notice that there was a correction to be made in this clause. So we are grateful to the Minister for bringing the amendment forward, and I hope that the Committee will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 257, in page 45, line 41, leave out subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I observe that there are some amendments by the Minister on the paper also dealing with subsection (6), which may solve my problems. This amendment is to remove subsection (6). Under Clause 27(1), the beneficiary, under a bare trust, is deemed to own the land. I am puzzled by the provision of subsection (6) which seems to envisage that for development land tax purposes, notwithstanding what I said about Clause 27(1), there can be distinction between the legal interest and the equitable interest. If subsection (6) is drawing that distinction, I should prefer to have it out of the Bill. If it is not, perhaps it has some other purpose. If it has a good purpose, I would have thought it should apply to the Bill in general, as it will if the Committee later accepts the Minister's amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's Amendments Nos. 284 and 307 will be moved formally as they have already been discussed. The Minister is entitled to decide on this.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. I am advised that those amendments, which I dealt with about 10 years ago, were to make the interpretation clause more comprehensive. They are consequential to that extent in respect of Clause 27.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1192</span>
Amendment No. 257 would leave out subsection (6). The Law Society of England and Wales has also made representations in relation to Clause 27(6), not appreciating why they were necessary. Perhaps the Committee will bear with me if I try to explain why they are necessary, because we are in a complicated area regarding trusts, settled property and the like. I think it is only right to put this on record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman said, Clause 27 deals with the case of a bare trust. The expression "bare trustee" is well known in English law but not in Scottish Law—that is, one where an interest in land is held by trustees for one or more beneficiaries who are absolutely entitled to it as against the trustees. The scheme of the clause and the legislation is that in the case where a person holds absolutely for a beneficiary, the latter should be treated as holding the legal estate. He does not hold the legal estate but the scheme of the legislation is that he should do so, so that any disposal by the trustee is treated as disposal by the beneficiary. It is a slight fiction but for practical purposes it works better.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I jump to Clause 28, which has a bearing on subsection (6) of Clause 27. Clause 28 deals with the case where an interest in land is held on bare trust and it is the beneficiary who disposes of his interest under the trust. We could have the kind of situation where the disposal was not made by the trustee of the land but the beneficiary could dispose of the interest. That kind of case would occur where the beneficiaries were tenants in common—or coparcener in Northern Ireland, as my hon. Friend will immediately appreciate—where the beneficiary is a tenant in common, each has a half-share of the trust, and one of them disposes of his interest. The legal title to the land does not leave the trustees, but the beneficiary disposes of his absolute right with his co-beneficiary to call for the estate from the trustees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 45(4) ensures that the interests of a beneficiary under a bare trust is treated as an interest in land, so ensuring that a DLT charge can be imposed on its disposal. If a beneficiary, who is half-owner under a bare trust, disposes of his interests, although he is disposing in law of an interest under a trust, the legislation makes it clear that for the purposes of this tax he is disposing of an
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1193</span>
interest in land, because that is what he is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So the effect of all this is that both the interest in land itself and the beneficiaries' interests are treated as interests in land and are both liable to DLT on a disposal. It is therefore necessary to provide rules to ensure that the correct amount of DLT is charged, whichever sort of interest is disposed of, and to prevent the same slice of development value being doubly taxed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So if the beneficiary disposes of his interest in the trust which is treated as an interest in land, he is taxed on that. It would be unfair if the trustees were then to dispose of the interest in the land and to be taxed as well. So the Bill makes provision to avoid double taxation in that case. Only one lot of tax is charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most of the rules relating to this are in Clause 28 and their effect is to allow a beneficiary on a disposal of his beneficial interest the appropriate proportion of the acquisition costs and so forth of the interests in land held by the trustees. They also allow any amount the beneficiary paid for his beneficial interest to be substituted for the apportioned acquisition cost, both on a disposal of his beneficial interest and on a disposal by the trustees of the interest in land held by them. The effect is that Clause 28 deals with most of these cases, except in one situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now we return to Clause 27(6). There is one situation which is not dealt with in Clause 28, and that is where a project is started on land in which an interest is held on a bare trust with two or more beneficiaries. There are two beneficiaries concerned here, and there is the commencement of a project of material development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Apparently, Clause 28 does not deal with that situation. If no special provision were made, it would be possible for both the interest in land held on the bare trust and the interests of the beneficiaries to be major interests—the phrase "major interests" is defined, as hon. Gentlemen will know—and thus be subject to a deemed disposal charge. This could result in the same amount of development value being doubly taxed. Clause 27(6) prevents this by providing that, if an interest in land held on a bare trust is a major interest, then the interests of the beneficiaries are treated as not being major interests and so are not subject to the deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1194</span>
I apologise to the Committee for such a long and involved explanation. If the right hon. Gentleman asks me why we did not put Clause 27(6) in Clause 28, I do not know the answer. Nevertheless, the important point which The Law Society and members of the Committee who are very concerned about these matters would wish to know is that Clause 27(6) is there to prevent double taxation, usually in a case where land is held on a bare trust by two or more co-owners, and there is the commencement of a project of material development. There is a deemed disposal but, because the legislation treats the interest of the trustee as an interest in land and the interest of the beneficiary as an interest in land, clearly it would not be right to charge two lots of tax. Clause 27(6) is designed to prevent double taxation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has no need to apologise. He has explained the point very clearly to the Committee. I think it could have been set out a little more clearly in the Bill. My complaint on some clauses has been that they have said too much. I think in this case that subsection (6) said too little.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not presume to offer an explanation as to why subsection (6) should be in Clause 27 and not in Clause 28, but I think it is in the right place in Clause 27, because there we are dealing with the legal interests of the trustees, bare trustees though they may be. Outside the legal profession, I am sure that nobody understands what a bare trustee is. It has nothing at all to do with what was on the radio this morning about nudist camps; it means merely that the beneficiary can at any moment call for the transfer of the legal estate to himself because he wholly owns the beneficial interest. The Minister has explained the simple point that where the legal interest is dealt with by the bare trustees, that is a major interest. We do not have to consider, under those circumstances, the beneficial interest of the beneficiaries as being a major interest under the provisions of Clause 2, dealing with deemed disposals. Perhaps it might have been better if we had used those two phrases, which are familiar to the legal profession, throughout these clauses, the legal interest and the beneficial interest. Then we would understand the beneficiaries' interest as being not treated as a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1195</span>
major interest unless they themselves so treat it, unless they themselves deal with their beneficial interest and dispose of it as such. We would understand that it should be treated as an interest which might come under consideration as a major interest deemed to be disposed of under other provisions of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for having explained the reason for subsection (6). I hope that he will not now rest on his laurels, having explained it so well, but that he will have another look at it to see whether that explanation can be better translated into the language of the Bill, so that we might have a subsection (6) which would tell the reader exactly what it means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 260, which proposes to leave out subsection (4), is really a probing amendment to see whether that subsection is necessary and, if so, what exactly it means. Again, I resort to the Explanatory Notes, which give a nice brief statement regarding Clause 28(4):
	<br><blockquote><p>"If there is only one beneficiary any disposal of the beneficial interest is treated as a corresponding disposal of the legal interest."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>1196</span>
I think that is quite understandable. If the beneficiary can call for legal title to the whole of the property, that is treated on the same level. If he disposes under Clause 28 of his beneficial interest, of course, it must be treated as a disposal of a legal interest. I see that clearly from the explanatory note, but I cannot see it from the subsection as it stands. Perhaps we could have a better explanation of how it happens under Clause 28(4), which would be helpful to those who have to read the Bill in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the same lines, we have in subsection (5) the opening words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subject to subsections (6) and (7) below, where there is more than one beneficiary for whom the legal interest is held".</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 258 seeks to substitute for those words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"is more than one beneficiary",</p></blockquote>
the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"are one or more beneficiaries".</p></blockquote>
It is little more than a drafting amendment, but I think it makes the subsection a lot clearer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Amendment No. 259 seeks to leave out from subsection (7) the words,
	<br><blockquote><p>"from a person who was a beneficiary at the time of the acquisition".</p></blockquote>
Subsection (7) is the one which deals with the case of a beneficiary acquiring the whole or any part of his beneficial interest from a person who was himself a beneficiary, and the actual cost of acquisition is used instead of the cost apportioned under subsection (5). I think this is a little difficult to understand, and the words which it is proposed to leave out under Amendment No. 259 seem only to confuse the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are, I hope, constructive amendments, even if they are to some extent probing, in order to have explanations on the record. We are dealing with Clause 28 which is a very technical clause. But it is one which will apply in a large number of cases because there are trusts of this sort; they are not very exceptional, but they are fairly frequent. Therefore, the legal profession and those who are dealing with these matters will have to know how to administer these sections, and a few explanations of this kind will perhaps help them to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The three amendments, as the right hon. Gentleman has
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1197</span>
indicated, are directed towards subsections (4), (5) and (7). This is a complicated matter involving trusts, and I will try to explain the aims of the three subsections.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4) deals with the case where there is only one beneficiary of the bare trust. Any disposal of the beneficial interest is treated as a corresponding disposal, and acquisition, of the legal interest; that is, the beneficiary is treated disposing of the legal interest at that time. Clause 27(1) provides that the legal interest is deemed to be vested in the beneficiary, and so the effect of this provision is that the beneficiary is treated as disposing of the legal interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a fiction, to some extent, but not too much of a fiction, because the beneficiary can call for the legal estate at practically any time, subject to payment of taxes and various other outgoings by the trustee. I believe it is different in Scotland. As the beneficiary can call for the estate, he is the legal owner, although perhaps not strictly in law. The Bill quite sensibly treats him as the legal owner and treats that disposal as of the legal interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) deals with the case where there is more than one beneficiary under the bare trust. As I explained earlier, that could happen where there were two tenants in common who between them could call for the legal estate. One cannot call for the legal estate by itself, and that complicates the matter. In that case, on the disposal of a beneficial interest, the amounts to be taken as its cost of acquisition, market value, current use value on disposal or acquisition and expenditure on improvements or relevant improvements are what is described in the subsection as the "relevant fraction" of the amounts applicable to the legal interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The relevant fraction comes into subsection (6). It is necessary to have a relevant fraction, because we have a situation where there are two beneficiaries with one possibly disposing of his interest to the other. Since he is treated as disposing of a legal interest, he gets a fraction of the cost of acquisition, a fraction of current use value, in order to ensure that the amount of tax is charged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (7) excludes, or in some cases partially excludes, subsection (5) where a beneficiary acquired the whole or any part of his beneficial interest from a
	<span class='label label-info column'>1198</span>
person who was himself a beneficiary. In many cases where there are joint tenants, one will not have acquired his interest from the other; the interest may have come from the settlor under a will where the property has been settled in trust for two people. In that case, subsection (5) applies and the apportionment takes place in respect of cost of acquisition, current use value and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned in subsection (7) with the situation where one beneficiary may have bought his interest from another. In such a case, the cost of acquisition of the beneficial interest, instead of being found by apportionment under subsection (5), is the amount actually paid by the new beneficiary. Alternatively, if nothing was paid, he looks through to the earlier beneficiary's cost under Clause 10. Any special addition will be calculated by reference to the amount actually paid for, and the actual time of acquisition of, the beneficial interest
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here with a case where there has been a definite acquisition of the beneficial interest by the person who is disposing, not an acquisition through the medium of the setting-up of a trust. In that case, subsection (5) is excluded, and we look at the actual situation. The cost of acquisition is the actual cost of acquisition to him, and special addition is calculated on that basis and in respect of the time he acquired the beneficial interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society has made representations about this problem in relation to subsections (5) and (7). In its memorandum of April 1976 several examples were given, and it was recommended that "in all cases the cost of acquisition of a beneficial interest should be used in computing the beneficiary's base value." The Law Society will not be pleased to hear this, but my advice is that its examples were not strictly correct and the point it is making is not strictly correct. It is only in cases where the property has been bought that we think the cost of acquisition should apply. We do not see why it should apply in all cases where the property has been acquired under a trust or under a will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not expect me to go through these examples which were put forward by the Law Society. We do not think they create a problem, and indeed, the society has not

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I am a member of the Law Society, as the Law Society has not seen fit to provide me with those examples, I cannot criticise them. I am only using my own common sense in trying to understand Clause 28 and to try to apply it to practical facts as I know them in my practice. I am grateful to the Minister for his clear explanation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One point occurred to me in connection with Amendment No. 259, where the beneficiary acquires:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the whole of any part of the beneficial interest from a person who was a beneficiary at the time of the acquisition".</p></blockquote>
It is possible that he might acquire that interest on the death of another beneficiary. At the moment of acquisition from the deceased beneficiary's personal representatives, he would not acquire it from the person who was the beneficiary because that person would be dead and no longer still a beneficiary. I am not sure whether a small amendment is necessary in those cases. Perhaps the Minister could look into that. It is a question of whether the person from whom he acquires must at the moment of acquisition be a beneficiary under the trust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Otherwise, I am grateful to the Minister for his explanations and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the amendment is to correct a drafting defect in the Bill. In Clause 32(5), "trustee in bankruptcy" is defined for Scotland for the purposes of that clause, and it is appropriate that a parallel definition should be inserted in Clause 29 also. Again, this is to meet the point that has been made that full cognisance should be taken of the differences of

I also speak on behalf of the hon.

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have already had a substantial discussion on Clause 30 because it cannot be considered by itself but only in relation to Clause 12. The Minister will remember that many of us were very concerned about the difficulties that give rise to the infinite complexities of an arrangement of partnership. We are, and were, grateful to the Minister for the clear—may be beguilingly clearway in which he sought to draw a distinction between the activities of the partnership where it was dealing with the outside world, and the activities of a partnership when it was dealing 	<i>inter se.</i>
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept that, as a matter of legal theory, it is possible to draw those clear distinctions. As in life, so in law; the Minister admitted that the practical difficulties might be considerable, and he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1201</span>
approached the problem in a spirit of fairmindedness and humility when he was dealing with our discussion in columns 822–3 of the OFFICIAL REPORT of the fifteenth sitting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all agree, I think, that there could be substantial practical difficulties, particularly where the partners are dealing with each other. Severe difficulties were encountered in respect of the capital gains legislation. We accept that it is unlikely that development land tax will be a matter to be taken into consideration in the dealings of the partners between themselves to the same extent that it has to be a matter for consideration in respect of capital gains tax. But there is still likely to be a problem, and I know the Minister will ask his professional advisers to reconsider this matter and to see whether there is any way in which these problems can be more accurately, if not more easily, considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before we leave Clause 30, we should be grateful if the Minister would tell us if there has been any further discussion on this matter as a result of our doubts about it, and whether he, with his wealth of highly-trained professional advice, and with the access which he has to those who have detailed professional knowledge of this, has any further information which he can give to the Committee. We concede that he faces the problem and that he is trying to deal with it in a sensible way. We should like to know what has been happening since our last discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman rightly said that partnerships are extremely difficult to deal with and that he would like to know what has been happening since we last discussed it. If I told him that one possible suggestion is that we might consider some kind of code of practice, I suppose he would be even more annoyed, and if he had not pressed me, I should not have mentioned it. For capital gains tax purposes, it was necessary—unfortunately, I agree—to have some kind of code of practice because of the complexities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without getting myself into terribly deep water and confusing things even more, perhaps I should again reiterate the points about partnership. When the right hon. Gentleman intervened to ask me whether, in the case of one partner he would have to bear the whole of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>1202</span>
development land tax, I rashly said I thought he would.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should explain to the Committee that, for the purposes of assessment—I think that is the best way of putting it—we are following the capital gains tax rules in respect of dealings between the partnership and the outside world. In other words, the partnership is treated as "the partnership" for the purposes of the £10,000 slice—that is, there is not a £10,000 slice for each person. I am not talking now about inter-partner dealings, but dealings with the outside world. For the purposes of the slice exemption, the partnership is treated as one unit, like it is in Scotland in law. For the purposes of assessment, this follows the capital gains tax provisions, where each partner and his share of that total partnership profit is assessed separately, because he only receives a share of the exempt slice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Income tax is different, for a variety of strange reasons which I have never fully understood, where the partnership is assessed as one unit. We are following here the capital gains tax provisions as regards assessment. I think it is better to put it that way because the partnership otherwise in respect of dealing with the outside world is treated as one unit. When the partners deal 	<i>inter se</i> between each other in respect of partnership assets, they are individuals dealing with other individuals and each one receives his exempt slice of £10,000 in respect of the portion of profit he makes in dealing with the other partners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that makes it a little clearer. We are holding discussions with the Law Society and the consultative committee of accountancy bodies to see whether, in practice, we cannot work out a system that will make it easier for everybody to deal with the extremely difficult situation and problem of taxing partnerships.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister whether there is an intention to introduce the results of those discussions on Report, or whether we shall have yet another of these undesirable extra-statutory arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all fed up with these outside discussions. I do not know what the devil we are sitting here in Committee for if we are to be told that everything is being settled outside. The Minister, when discussing the last amend-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1203</span>
ment, referred to some discussions over examples which had been supplied by the Law Society. The Committee does not know what those examples were; they may have been absolutely vital to enable us to understand the amendment. I do not blame the Minister for not reading them out, but I think that those who are holding discussions should at least inform the members of this Committee, who are struggling with a complicated Bill of this sort, what those discussions are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has been very frank and open with us all the way through these Committee proceedings. He has tried in an admirable way to explain things. I have no complaint about that. But when I hear that all these discussions are taking place outside between the Law Society and the accountants, when we are struggling with the Bill here and trying to understand it, I get a little annoyed. When I am told for example that the discussions on capital gains tax went on for five years after the legislation had been passed and only then did some statement of practice emerge, I want to know what will happen to these discussions now taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend talked about the extra-statutory concession. We are not talking about an extra-statutory concession now; it is a code of practice or a practice statement. I do not know where to find them, and I bet no member of this Committee could put his finger on those codes of practice. These little booklets on extra-statutory concessions one acquires quite simply. I have had these for many years. I merely comment that the last one is dated 1970 and all the amendments since then are loose leaf inside the book. That is the sort of thing that we have to put up with in trying to understand finance legislation—and the Development Land Tax Bill is a finance Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are to have added to these loose-leaf extra-statutory concessions some codes of practice which are issued in Press statements which, with a bit of luck, a Member of this House can find in the Library, which is very good at providing research material. But it probably happens that that particular Press statement has been taken out by another Member just at the time when one wants to refer to it. It really is not good enough, when we are dealing with legislation of this sort, to be told that at some future date—it may be years ahead—
	<span class='label label-info column'>1204</span>
when we have finished these nice little tea parties between accountants, solicitors, the Bar, and I do not know what other associatons, some code of practice will be issued. If this matter has to be left to that sort of thing, we should have it in orders properly made by Treasury Ministers, which can be debated in the House, even if they are pushed through late at night. But at least we should have a chance to debate them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has any Member of the House or Parliament itself had an opportunity of debating the existing code of practice on partnershp matters? The answer is "No". We have never had an opportunity of looking at it. Perhaps the Opposition should choose a Supply day to debate codes of practice issued by the Board of Inland Revenue. If I am becoming a little heated in my outburst, Mr. Costain, it is because it is something which has been stored up for a long time, and which has come to a head now that we are dealing with Clause 30—the partnership clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen). The House does not have an opportunity to deal adequately with these matters. On a matter like this, a Standing Committee ought to be able to resolve itself into a Select Committee and call for evidence from the parties concerned—the Law Society, the chartered accountants and the surveyors as well—so that we could understand the problems. I should be going beyond the rules of order if I pursued that matter for too long on this occasion, but in support of the right hon. Gentleman, I hope that the Minister will take note of what he said and consider circulating to members of the Committee any written information which he feels would be of value. The right hon. Gentleman himself, when he was the Minister responsible for the Local Government Bill a few years ago, circulated to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1205</span>
hon. Members serving on that Standing Committee considerable written information in support of what he was able to say. I support what has been said about the need for these codes of conduct to appear, if possible, in the form of statutory instruments so that the House of Commons has an adequate way of monitoring them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have some sympathy with what the right hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend have said. There are two points here. The right hon. Gentleman made a point regarding the representations of the Law Society. Representations of this kind are in a different category from the so-called code of practice with which we are concerned. We asked for representations on the Bill. We published a White or Green Paper or whatever, we published draft clauses and we asked specifically for representations. We received them from a number of bodies. On the last amendment, I referred to one representation which we had received from the Law Society. I am surprised that the Law Society did not send its representations to members of the Committee. I was not aware that this was the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That kind of consultation is extremely valuable. It has helped the passage of this Bill that outside bodies can consult on draft clauses. But, of course, they must remember that, at the end of the day, Members of Parliament have to decide these matters and take them through the legislative process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On those consultation papers which go out to the various bodies, I wish that it were the practice to allow hon. Members to have them or to place them in the Library. The hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) was kind enough to refer to the procedure over the Local Government Bill. On that occasion, any consultation papers of vital importance which went out to the local authority associations were put in the Library for hon. Members. If we could break down the idea that legislation must be discussed in private between Departments and bodies outside, if we could put a little nail in their coffin, I should be happy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I get consultation papers of this sort under the counter. I am not supposed to know anything about them. It would be
	<span class='label label-info column'>1206</span>
of great help in tax legislation if we knew beforehand a little about these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There were no consultation papers in this case. I was referring to the fact that we had invited representations from bodies on draft clauses that we had published. Representations were made which were of great help to Ministers and have been of great help during the proceedings of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point was on the code of practice. This is an extremely difficult problem. I favour some form of publication which is better known and more widely distributed than some of the professional journals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And which gives the House the right to discuss it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And which gives the House, because it is well known and publicised, the opportunity to discuss it. I give the Committee the assurance that I shall explore this matter to see whether in future we can find a better way of doing it so that at least attention can be drawn to these matters and hon. Members can discuss them in the House if they wish to. They do not have the force of law, so there is no question of having to change or approve them. But it is important that hon.

This is a probing amendment. My right hon. Friend has been discussing the position of a bare trustee and has clearly set out the technical meaning. The concept of the bare trustee is narrower and more carefully defined than that of an agent, and we believe that there may be advantages, in these circumstances, in having a more carefully defined legal term of art than the wider concept of an agent.

The term "decree of foreclosure" which is in Clause 31, although commonly used to describe decrees under Section 8 of the Heritable Securities (Scotland) Act 1894 and, indeed, accurately describing the effect of such decrees, is not specifically used in that Act. The law relating to the granting of heritable securities was amended by the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1970 and securities granted since 1970 are enforceable, in terms, by decrees of foreclosure. The 1894 Act, however, still applies to securities granted before 1970 and it is appropriate that the similar type of decree under Section 8 of the 1894 Act should also be covered by Clause 31(3).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have waited patiently for the hon. Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>1208</span>
Farnworth (Mr. Roper) to rise to his feet to protect the Scots—not that there are any Scottish Members on the Government side of the Committee. I thought he would ask what was meant by "heritable securities" and "decree of foreclosure", but evidently his hon. Friend the Minister explained it very fully to him and satisfied him on those points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One question which I want to ask on this clause relates to the position of the mortgagee when there is an exempt body. If a local authority is acquiring from a mortgagee who is selling, what about the payment of the proceeds? Does the exempt body deduct the development land tax from the purchase money? If so, it will look a little odd, not only to the private mortgagee, but to the institutions which have lent money. If, on the other hand, this is a way of avoiding the deduction of development land tax from the purchase money paid by an exempt body, it seems that a few holes might be shot in the Bill by doing that, or that a carriage and four might be driven through it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At any rate, now that we have turned the mortgagee into a bare trustee, perhaps I ought to have asked this question in the case of a bare trustee. If the bare trustee sells the legal estate, he is dealing with the exempt body which will deduct the tax and pay net. Having turned the mortgagee into a bare trustee—by the admirable success of my hon. Friend's amendment—will the exempt body deduct the development tax from the money to be paid to the mortgagee? If that is so, I do not think that any bank or any building society would lend money again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we are in some difficulty over this. The mortgagee is not the person who is liable for tax, but now it seems as if inadvertently we may have turned him into a person liable for development land tax by calling him a bare trustee. If so, we should need to have some proviso added to the clause, which provided that under these circumstances he would get the whole purchase money from the exempt body which is purchasing the property. As in all cases when one is talking on "clause stand part" without the discipline of an amendment which must be discussed, the explanation is not always as clear as it might be. I hope I have explained the problem. I wonder whether the Minister can solve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am advised that the right hon. Gentleman's point is covered, but he should not look in the Bill; he should look at the Order Paper where he will see a substantial Government amendment, Amendment No. 406, which proposes a new paragraph 8, to Schedule 7. I hope, before we debate that amendment, to let hon. Members have an explanation of what it covers. I am not sufficiently well briefed to explain it at the moment, but no doubt we shall have a detailed discussion on it when we come to Schedule 7. I am merely telling the right hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister. Perhaps I was putting the point with my tongue in my cheek. I had indeed read the 8½ pages of Amendment No. 406, which the Government have seen fit to put down to Schedule 7, in which they rewrite half the Bill. This highlights my complaint about consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit frankly to the Minister that by undercounter methods I have obtained—I shall not say where or from whom—the fixed explanation of his 8½ page amendment. He has kindly said that he will give it to the rest of the Committee. If he had not done so, I think I might have had it photocopied and distributed it myself. The amendment was tabled without any explanation, but it has been the subject of consultations between the Government and outside bodies, one of which kindly, through intermediaries, supplied me with copies of the papers. So I know something about the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I again complain that these discussions go on outside the Committee. We are presented with an amendment as a result of those discussions and only at the last moment are we told that we may have some explanation from the Minister before we reach the debates on the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the position is made clear by the amendments on the Amendment Paper to Schedule 7 which we shall
	<span class='label label-info column'>1210</span>
discuss later. But I wonder whether the Minister would also consider, in relation to Clause 31, whether there should be something in that clause referring the reader to the schedule which disposes of this point, so that when we read about mortgagees selling and the enforcement of security by mortgagees and other creditors we shall see at once in that clause that the mortgagee who is selling to an exempt body will not have to pay the tax out of the proceeds of sale. I think that ought to be made clear in Clause 31.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall look at that point and, if it is necessary to make an amendment, we will make it.

Regarding the new schedule which we are putting down, my right hon. Friend the former Paymaster-General mentioned on Second Reading that we were having consultations with local authorities and that we intended to put down amendments to operate the net of tax provisions. The new amendment in that schedule deals with the net of tax arrangements with the local authorities. We had to consult them, and at the end of the day it is the Committee which will decide whether it wants to accept the results of those consultations as manifested in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assure hon. Members that there was no intention to present the Committee with the explanation a few hours before we were due to debate it. I hope it will be possible to give members of the Committee plenty of time to study the explanation of the schedule and enable them to decide their reactions. I accept entirely that it is undesirable that this sort of thing should happen from time to time. It would have been better if the Bill had contained these provisions so that hon. Gentlemen and right hon. Gentlemen could have put down amendments at the beginning of the Committee stage. In this case, we had to consult the local authority associations because they will have to operate the legislation and this is something new for them. Hon. Gentlemen have argued that it should not be done in this way. It is their prerogative to argue that, but we have to consult them because it is something new for them and it is only right that we should do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept the criticism. It would have been better if the provision had been in the Bill originally, but because of the process of consultation it was not possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least we can welcome the fact that it will be done, albeit belatedly, in the Bill and not by regulation, nor by any form of concession or extra-statutory arrangement. I am sure the Minister would have preferred to do it in a more orderly way by putting it in the Bill from the beginning. We feel that our objections against the constitutional impropriety of these various forms of arrangement over which Parliament has no control have been carefully considered and, I think, accepted in principle by the Minister. We thank him for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 31 deals with the case of the mortgagee sale, and I wanted assurance that Clause 31 would provide that tax should not be deducted from the proceeds of sale so far as they clear the mortgagee's mortgage. The heading of the amendment refers only to pre-12th September 1974 mortgages. I said earlier in connection with Clause 31 that nobody would ever lend on property in future if the development land tax would have to be paid. It looks as though I was right for the future, although not for the past. We shall need some explanation about that and, if necessary, at a later stage we shall table quite a substantial amendment to Clause 31.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave Clause 32, I should like to ask the Minister whether any later consideration of the clause by those who advise him has revealed any issue of principle. I have considered it carefully and I have noted what he said in the explanatory booklet. It does not seem to me to give rise to any issue of principle, nor do I note anything that gives rise to any problem of practicability. I may well be wrong; this is not an area in which I have any professional expertise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that during Committee stages there is a continuing assessment and reassessment of the practical effects of
	<span class='label label-info column'>1212</span>
legislation and that the Minister treats us with complete openness and points out the difficulties in legislation, particularly when we are dealing with practical as opposed to political matters. If there is anything to be said, I am sure that he will say it at this stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A similar point arises here as on Clause 31. Clause 32 deals with liquidation and the trustee in bankruptcy. Let me take an example which I must give off the cuff because I have not thought it out carefully. If mortgaged property is in the estate of a bankrupt, I presume that the Revenue will be a preferred creditor for development land tax. If the creditor or mortgagee who has his loan secured on property chooses not to prove in the liquidation or the bankruptcy but to rely on his security, will he then be liable to development land tax on that property which he takes out of the estate of the bankrupt or out of the liquidation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If, on the other hand, he proves in the bankruptcy or liquidation as in any other case of the preferred creditor, the Inland Revenue, he would have to stand for the tax being taken out of the estate before he comes in for his own debt against the estate. I am not sure whether the clause deals with the case of the property of the mortgagee with his loan secured on property, not proving in the bankruptcy but relying on the property itself for the realisation of the amount owing to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has raised a difficult point. I confess that I cannot at the moment give him an answer. We shall certainly look into it. My immediate reaction is that Clause 32 does not deal with that situation because it is, to some extent, a mechanical clause in that what it does and what it says is that where interest in land is vested in a liquidator the acts of the liquidator shall be treated for all purposes as the acts of the company or the insolvent. In other words, it is exactly the same situation as we had with the bare trustee. There is not therefore any development land tax chargeable as between the bankrupt and the vesting of a property in the trustee in bankruptcy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am informed that in general there is no question of a mortgagee being liable in respect of his interest. I refer the right hon. Gentleman to Clause 45(2)(	<i>a</i>), which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I1219">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>1213</span>
makes it clear that the mortgagee is not liable in respect of his interest. I hope that answers his point. I can assure the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) that this is a technical clause. As far as I can see, there is no issue of principle here. If there are any problems when the Bill becomes law, no doubt we will attempt to put them right later. But I cannot see that Clause 32 affects anything of substance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
