<div class='title'><span class='label label-warning'>title</span>
CURRENT USE VALUE AND MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 116, in page 98, line 28, leave out 'ten' and insert 'forty'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this we may take Amendment No. 117: page 98, line 39, leave out 'three' and insert 'ten'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The first amendment seeks to allow a far longer period when the building which was on a site which has become a cleared site shall be taken into account. The Bill, as drafted, refers to
<br><blockquote><p>"the carrying out of works for the rebuilding … of any building which was in existence at the relevant time,"</p></blockquote>
which is not very long ago—
<br><blockquote><p>"or of any building which was in existence in the period of ten years immediately preceding the day on which that time falls but was destroyed or demolished before the relevant time".</p></blockquote>
I note particularly the use of the word "destroyed", because that brings to mind enemy action. Indeed, it will be within the knowledge of members of the Committee that one need not go very far from this place to come across sites which are still cleared sites—bomb sites, as they are called—which were destroyed during the Second World War.<br><br>
If we are left with only 10 years, the building which was on the site prior to the wartime demolition cannot be taken into account. That seems unreasonable, particularly if we have cases where the rebuilding of the war-damaged or war-destroyed building has been held up, as it has been on some occasions, by long outstanding discussions with the local authority or planning authority as to what the use should be, or the desire on some occasions of the authority that the particular site—a small site—should be
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 488</span>
included within a larger and more comprehensive development. To my certain knowledge on the South Bank there are such sites, I think in Comprehensive Development Area No. 1, which is noted for the relative absence of comprehensive development within the area. It is also noted for the fact that there exist bomb sites—I imagine most of them date from 1940, but there are some from subsequent years. It seems reasonable to me that the building previously on the site should be taken into account in those cases.<br><br>
Amendment No. 117 relates to a different circumstance—whether the temporary use of land for car parking shall constitute material development. It is suggested in subsection (<i>e</i>) that the temporary use of the land for car parking for a period not exceeding three years should not constitute material development. This seems to be a rather arbitrary restriction. The complexities of property development are such—and I do not think they are made any less complex by the Bill—that it is frequently the situation that a site which is to be part of a larger development may go out of use as a building and become available for car parking.<br><br>
On some occasions—I have in mind particularly occasions when that site forms part of or adjoins a shopping centre—there will be pressure to use the cleared site for car parking purposes. Inevitably, because of the time these things take—and it is not only the proceedings of the Committee which sometimes seem to be interminable, it is also the deliberations of planning committees about large-scale planning schemes—the temporary use will continue for a number of years. It therefore seems entirely reasonable that a much longer period than three years should be allowed for the temporary use of the site for car parking without that use constituting material development and triggering all the rigmarole that necessarily follows according to the provisons of the Bill.<br><br>
I am sure that if the Government wish to come back and say that they do not like 10 years but they like seven years, we could reach a reasonable compromise on it. But I hope that they will accept that three years seems an unreasonably short time bearing in mind the period that often elapse before a whole site is ready for development and the development can proceed.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 489</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I say a few words on these amendments which my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) has so eloquently moved. First, I find it difficult to contemplate in what circumstances many of the things listed in paragraph 5 will actually accrue any development value at all. For example, if a site has been a car park for three years and is still a car park, I fail to see in what way there is any likelihood of development value which would be taxable. The agrument would equally well apply for 10 years or whatever other proposal my hon. Friend puts before the Committee.<br><br>
Similarly, regarding 40 years as opposed to 10 years, my mind immediately went to the very real prospects, for example, in the green belt where, as the Committee and the Minister will know, it is quite common, if an agricultural building or indeed a house which has been in the green belt for time out of mind falls down or is burnt down the planning authorities will not give permission for it to be rebuilt because it is in the green belt. My hon. Friend nods. He knows as well as I do that it is quite common in such circumstances and, to my mind, brings the planning laws into disrepute. I can see that in city centres the 10-year provision that is Amendment No. 116, would be very real.<br><br>
Reverting to Amendment No. 117 regarding car parks—although, as I said, I find it difficult to envisage in what circumstances development value would actually accrue—there are many car parks—I can think of one within about 400 yards from here—where the car park is situated on land which is bomb-damaged land. This is Broad Sanctuary car park which has been in existence as a car park for many years. Clearly a three-year figure in those circumstances would be unreasonable.<br><br>
When the Minister replies to the amendments will he say whether they Government envisage that any development value could accrue, having deliberately taken powers in para. 5 to exclude it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask one question on these periods? For example, on the car park, what this paragraph says is,
<br><blockquote><p>"To the extent that any of the following activities constitutes development, they do not constitute
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 490</span>
material development for the purposes of the Act, namely,—…</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>e</i>) the carrying out of operations for, or the use of land for, car parking".</p></blockquote>
When the work starts on land for car parking, perhaps on a bombed site or a derelict site or where a property has been demolished, it is not usually certain whether one will have the car park there for one year, three years, seven years or 10 years. Yet we have the proviso here:
<br><blockquote><p>"provided that such use shall not exceed three years;".</p></blockquote>
After it has been there for three years, does it become a material development when it was not so to start with? Or, if one starts off, how does the Inland Revenue make certain that one is starting on a car park which will be there for more than three years? I do not see the relevance of these periods or what happens at the end of a period.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might reply to these points and deal with the particular points made by the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) in discussing both of these amendments. Paragraph 5(1)(<i>b</i>) of Schedule 4 follows very closely the Finance Act 1974. I will not quote all the subparagraphs of it unless I am asked to do so. This follows the development gains charge quite closely, and as far as the car parking provision is concerned, I am sure the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) will recall that the exception for car parking was a direct result of Opposition activity during discussion on Report of the development gains tax in the 1974 Act. What we are doing is inserting what satisfied them on that occasion, hoping and expecting it to satisfy them again on this occasion.<br><br>
I understand that the Opposition's expectations may have increased, but our reluctance to grant those expectations has not diminished. They remain the same. Perhaps we can claim a little more consistency here than Conservative Members.<br><br>
Turning to Amendment No. 116, under the Finance Act 1974 the right to rebuild does not constitute material development for existing buildings and those buildings that were demolished 10 years before the relevant disposal. It is quite fair that the right to rebuild must be a basic right. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0834">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 491</span>
right to rebuild those buildings which have recently been demolished is also a right.<br><br>
So we come to the problem of what amount of time should elapse after a building has been demolished before the right to rebuild it goes. Looking at it this way, at least there is a broad measure of agreement on both sides of the Committee that there must be a time limit. We think that 10 years is a reasonable period and Conservative Members think that 40 years might be more acceptable. I am fairly flexible on this. I think 10 years is about right, but if the Opposition wish to pursue this, I should like time to consider it a little further so as to take into account a wider range of experience and see how many cases it is likely to effect, and what are the implications. I can see no particular reason why the hon. Gentleman should want to change that 10-year period, but if it pleases him, and because of our desire to make progress, I can offer the assurance of a further examination here.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has sat down, but perhaps I could put a question to him. Can Ministers conceive of any circumstances in which development value could accrue? I appreciate that these words were in the development gains tax legislation and that a scissors-and-paste job has been effectively done. I was not on the Committee which considered the development gains tax so I do not know what was said at that time. However, I have been wracking my brains to think of any circumstances. Let us suppose that the three-year limit was passed. Let us suppose that the car park had been there for three years and a day and was still a car park. In what circumstances could development value accrue? This is the practical point on which I should be grateful for guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is hard for me to give precise examples. Clearly a number of car parks, particularly in city centres, can operate in conjunction with other facilities which could bring certain development values into consideration. The main aspect of this was still the comment of the Opposition of that time, who so sufficiently convinced the Government of that day of the rightness of their proposals that I was sure they would be satisfied without going any further. I think this is a reasonable position and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 492</span>
perhaps Tory Members might care to leave it at that.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry but I do not feel like leaving it at that. If the Financial Secretary is intending to copy slavishly the paragraph in the 1974 Act, he will find that he has, certainly in some cases, very conveniently altered that schedule. For example, he has introduced in paragraph 5(1)(<i>c</i>) the agricultural point, which is quite new. When he calls in aid the arguments on car parking in the course of the 1974 Bill, this was, of course, a form of compromise at the time. I do not know how it has worked since then.<br><br>
4.45 p.m.<br><br>
I am still puzzled by how it is decided, when a project like this starts, whether it will be a car park for three years or 10 years, or whatever it may be. The Financial Secretary queries whether the figure of 10 years was right in paragraph (<i>b</i>). If so, if it were right there, why was it not right in paragraph (<i>e</i>)? My recollection is Keats:
<br><blockquote><p>"O for ten years, that I may overwhelm</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>Myself in poesy; so I may do the deed</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>That my own soul has to itself decreed."</p></blockquote>
I do not know what the deed my own soul here decreed would be, but certainly our amendment decrees that it should be 40 years, instead of Keats' 10, for us to do the deed that our souls have decreed shall be done.<br><br>
It is true that in the 1974 Act it was 10 years in paragraph (<i>b</i>). But we are not dealing with development gains tax. The Government have chosen to have a new form of tax altogether, the development land tax and to phase out the development gains tax. Therefore we must look at all these matters afresh and see what is appropriate for this tax.<br><br>
Following our re-examination of this schedule, although it is similar to the schedule in the 1974 Act, we have put forward these practical and constructive suggestions to make it operate more fairly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have to remember, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has just said, that we are looking at these clauses in the context of a different Bill, and in particular in the context of a Bill which would make industrial and commercial concerns developing their own land for their own
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0835">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 493</span>
purposes, with no intention to let or sell any part of it, liable for this tax, which was not the circumstance under the development gains tax. Therefore we have to look carefully at the consequences of a 10 year rule like this one.<br><br>
The Financial Secretary was generous enough to say that he would reconsider it. Could I put it to him that if he does not want to make a general extension from 10 years to 40 years, perhaps he could take into account, first, those premises which were previously in the use of the owners for industrial or commercial purposes, and secondly instances where the premises were demolished or destroyed more than 10 years ago by enemy action. In both those cases I should have thought that there was a need to consider a longer period.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) wondered whether there could be one material development accruing from car parks. I can just visualise the circumstances where there might be some dilapidated, run-down residential property immediately behind a rather valuable shopping street, for example, where the use of that area for car parking would produce a gain over current use value. The demand for car parking in that area could be such that its use purely as a car park could throw up some material gain.<br><br>
The most worrying thing is that one has to go through all the wretched calculations, one has to do the notifications. One can even be sent to jail for failing to notify. We trigger off all the operations rather unnecessarily. Therefore I suggest to the Financial Secretary that in those circumstances he might also like to consider a longer period for car parks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it is generally understood that in this matter of periods, which tend by their very nature to be something that can be moved in either direction, one comes to a view as to what might be a suitable period.<br><br>
Three years in connection with car parks is not unreasonable, because car parks nowdays and in future are likely to have rather more development value of a kind that the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) referred to. One can go further than the particular example he mentioned. It may be that our picture of car parks as run-down, dilapidated sites might be altered by certain changes in consumer
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 494</span>
habits over the years. There could be some pretty considerable potentials as a result of these changes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw the Minister's attention to the subparagraph immediately before that which deals with the use of land for the display of advertisements. This is a similar use to that of car parks. One does not know whether the advertisement hoardings round a derelict site will be there for any length of time or, indeed, whether they will be permanent. There is exactly the same argument in respect of that subparagraph as with car parks yet in respect of advertisements there is no time limit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman's experience might be a little different from mine, but I have had a fair bit to do with advertising, at least during times of general elections. My understanding of the poster site industry is that its profitabilities in general are of a much lower order than the possible profitabilities of car parks. As I said before, they can become much more valuable than they are at present. There are a number of public companies very much engaged in such activities at present. There is no division between us that this legislation should be subject to a time limit, and I think three years is about right.<br><br>
I am not quite so certain about Amendment No. 116. I would like to examine—because of its greater importance—a number of other cases to see where the balance should be struck. I give that undertaking, and perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will see fit to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Financial Secretary's remarks, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 96, in page 99, line 13, at end insert:
<br><blockquote><p>'(<i>j</i>) The erection of an industrial building so long as the gross floor space to be comprised in that building does not exceed 1,500 square metres.</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>k</i>) The erection of a building other than an industrial building so long as the gross floor space to be comprised in that building does not exceed 1,000 square metres'.</p></blockquote>
As we have already been reminded, we are concerned with pieces borrowed
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0836">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 495</span>
from the Finance Act 1974. I have made frequent reference to a verison of it in plain English. This Act was concerned with a tax of a different nature, occurring in different circumstances. In particular, as I have already said, an industrialist using development land for his own use could not become liable to development gains tax. He was in occupation and continuing to be in occupation, whereas in the circumstances of this Bill he could become liable for development land tax.<br><br>
Under the Community Land Act regulations the Secretary of State excepts certain categories of development from the operations of that Act, particularly categories of industrial development, and it would seem reasonable therefore that they should also be taken out of the definition of material development for the purposes of the Development Land Tax Bill. If they were not so taken out, the consequence would be that on occasions an industrial firm concerned in carrying out a development which would be excepted development for the purposes of the Community Land Act, would find itself caught for a development land tax payment.<br><br>
As I said before, it would have to take into account its entitlement for betterment against the expense and complications of working it out and making note of it and quite possibly paying tax which would be a straight increase on the costs of that industry and that process. I therefore feel that these are small but worthwhile further exemptions from the categories of development which would constitute. material development.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's Amendment No. 96 follows very closely, as he said, on Classes 4 and 5 of the Schedule to the Community Land Excepted Development Regulations 1976. I think I am right in saying that part (<i>i</i>) of his amendment is a reasonable summary of Class 4 and part (<i>k</i>) a reasonable summary of Class 5. I say "a reasonable summary" because he has restricted his amendment since Classes 4 and 5 were in the plural. Class A speaks of
<br><blockquote><p>"The erection of one or more industrial buildings"</p></blockquote>
and Class 5 speaks of
<br><blockquote><p>"The erection of one or more buildings other than any industrial building".</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend has not gone so far in his amendment. He talks solely of one
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 496</span>
building. Therefore there is, so to speak, a benefit to the Revenue there in that he has not sought to deal with the problem of one or more buildings on the site but with the total cubic capacity and has arrived at the figures in the amendment.<br><br>
I have always thought that it was very odd that the Government did not work into the Development Land Tax Bill the same exemptions as they put into the Community Land Act. This is, I know, a matter which the Housebuilders' Federation has urged on the Government on several occasions—that the exemptions should be on all fours. I know that the Government will say that they have done other things, that there is the £10,000 and Case A and so on. But it would have been greatly for the convenience, not only of Parliament in discussing this legislation but also of the practitioners—if it reaches the statute book—to have the exemptions, on all fours and to have the same system in one measure as in the other, particularly when we bear in mind that the intention of the Government is that the Community Land Act shall to a considerable extent be used to implement the development land tax, that is, the local authorities will be buying the land net of development land tax. My hon. Friends amendment relates to reasonably modest-sized buildings and after all the (<i>k</i>) exemption has, to be one building. It is no good the Government saying "This could be 10 houses" which is the case in the Community Land Act exemption of non-industrial premises. It has to be one building. It will be a pretty large building which is 1,000 sq. metres. I suppose it could be a block of flats but certainly not individual houses. I think my hon. Friend's amendment is very reasonable and I hope that the Government will consider it seriously.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) and the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) made the same points except that there were certain slight differences of accent. The hon. Member for Hove said that, because certain development was excepted under the Community Land scheme, it does not mean that it should not be taxed. Certain developments may be excepted under this scheme but we believe that all development gains should be taxed in this way. The hon. Member for Melton said that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0837">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 497</span>
the two pieces of legislation, the Community Land Act and this Bill, should be on all fours. I understand his point that for simplicity they should be the same. But there are differences. Under the one scheme this is represented as a simplification. But simplification for the purposes of the Community Land Act is one thing; the avoidance of taxation is another.<br><br>
5 p.m.<br><br>
What we are concerned with in the Bill is not implementing the whole of the community land scheme as such, but making sure that the community gets the benefit through the development land tax of those gains that arise. Paragraph 5(1) of Schedule 4 lists those activities which do not constitute material development for development land purposes, and the amendment tries to add two further categories. It says that if one erects an industrial building of not more than 1,500 square metres, or—in the second category—a non-industrial building of not more than 1,000 square metres, these should be exempted.<br><br>
It is a small amount, but it is not unreasonable that these should be taxed. The amendment would have the further and much more important consequence that it would allow the developer to escape tax by the use of what one might call "salami" tactics, that is, splitting the development up into a number of small projects, each one of which would be free from tax in a way that no Government could possibly accept.<br><br>
Under the Bill developers have the opportunity for rebuilding and extensions within the 110 per cent. tolerance. There is also the 10 per cent. addition to current use value in the base scheme, which is a further margin, and, as we know, under small developments there is the extension for the first £10,000 of development value in each financial year, plus the further amount at a lower rate of tax than the top rate.<br><br>
We are ensuring that the small amounts of development are being looked after. In view of the difference between the community land scheme and the development land tax additional to the problems of tax avoidance, I think it is not unreasonable to ask that this amendment not be accepted.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 498</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has rightly pointed out that the £10,000 exemption is likely to pick up at least a fair proportion of the developments which we are considering under Amendment No. 96. However, there may well be occasions where advantage cannot be taken of the £10,000 exemption. We are discussing here two different types of development. It is perhaps a pity that we included them both in the one amendment. May I deal with industrial building first.<br><br>
The way in which the Bill works at the moment is that, because there is the 10 per cent. tolerance, the person who has a large building can expand by 1,500 square metres, whereas the small businessman, the small trader, the small manufacturer, will not be able to use that 10 per cent. tolerance because he will not have sufficient original building on which to expand. So as it stands, the Bill creates an unfairness between the big boys and the little boys, between the owners who have a large industrial building and those who have only a small industrial building. Because in so many cases, as the Financial Secretary has said, those who want to expand by these small amounts will be protected elsewhere in the Bill, the Inland Revenue would not lose much by allowing this exception on industrial buildings as we have set it out in (<i>j</i>).<br><br>
Although only a few may not be able to take advantage of the other exemptions in the Bill, it will be a great hardship for those few—particularly the small and expanding factories, of which there are a great number. We are apt to think and talk about the big boys who are employing thousands, but there is a large number of small factories which we want to encourage—the up-and-coming Morrises, who start with a bicycle shop. Those are the sort of people whom we want to encourage and the people who will not benefit by the exemptions in the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is one of those occasions when the reasonable and considerate-sounding voice of the Financial Secretary only masks the grasping hand of the Revenue. It is trying to grab every tiny bit, regardless of the complications, the extra administration, and the number of occasions when, having worked it all out, there will be nil tax to pay.<br><br>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. Friend will read out the list of dedications.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Our Chairman, considerate though he is, may feel that I am straying a little from the amendment if I were to do so. The reference to minor development projects which are exepted development proposals under the Community Land Act—the 1,000 square metres referred in the second part of the amendment is explained as:
<br><blockquote><p>"… any development (other than industrial development) where the total floor space created does not exceed 10,000 square feet."</p></blockquote>
We have moved on—we are metricating here, if not elsewhere. The exploration continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"This exception is designed to cover a very wide range of development."</p></blockquote>
The sorts of development referred to are:
<br><blockquote><p>"small-scale housing developments … small commercial buildings, most recreational buildings, other small buildings, e.g. churches, meeting halls, a wide range of extensions to buildings of all types.".</p></blockquote>
These are just the sort of developments into which we do not want to bring tax complications. We do not want to prevent them or deter the developer because he is uncertain as to the possibility of his being required to do a complicated calculation and pay some development land tax. It will not be very much. As my right hon. Friend has said, we ar<i>c</i> not asking for large-scale exemptions. We are seeking small-scale exemptions to bring the Bill into line with the Community Land Act, with which it is intended to work very closely. I therefore hope that the Financial Secretary will have second thoughts on the merits of the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is very much that I can add about non-industrial buildings, that is paragraph (<i>k</i>) of the amendment.

<p>hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) and particularly the comments of the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page).</p>
<p>May I draw the Committee's attention to a matter that we shall be debating much later during the progress of the Bill, namely, the deferment provisions in Clause 19, under which development for an industrialist's own industrial use will be—as I am sure will be accepted by the Committee—one further built-in relief from the development land tax. That, in connection with the exemption at low levels and the problems about avoidance that I mentioned, adds a little to some of the arguments in my opening remarks. Perhaps it might be regarded as a further reason not to press the amendment.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has given a good reason for pressing the amendment. If it is already excluded, why complicate the matter further by not making the exclusions very clear by this definition of size to cover all circumstances and to bring in the important sector of retailing? I therefore hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will support me in this matter.</span></p>

<p><i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. Could I ask your guidance on this matter? I see that we have the pleasure of the company of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Scotland Exchange (Mr. Parry). Anything I have to say about his position here is in no way personal to him, but I assume from his presence that he has been appointed to this Committee in substitution for the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hands-worth (Mr. Lee), whom we noticed was absent on some occasions. But a serious point arises, I wonder whether we can be informed when he was appointed to this Committee.<br><br>
As I understand the position, the balance of representation upon these Standing Committees should represent the balance of representation on the Floor of the House. The balance of representation on the Floor of the House changed yesterday, and, in that event, I submit that if there is an appointment to this Committee after the time at which the balance of representation on the Floor of the House changed, a Labour Member should be replaced by an hon. Member from one of the Opposition parties. Therefore it is not a matter of minor or academic interest when the hon. Member for Liverpool, Scotland Exchange was appointed to this Committee. We wish to know at what time he was appointed.<br><br>
It is not an academic point merely in relation to the hon. Member. If it be that a Labour Member were for some reason or other moved upwards, side-wards or downwards—I know not what—presumably there would be a need for a further appointment again to this Committee. Again I contend that such an appointment should reflect the balance of power on the Floor of the House. I should be grateful if you could give your guidance on this point, Mr. Fitch.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Fitch. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) has asked the question, but I
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 502</span>
should have thought that this was a matter which should be considered by the Committee of Selection and not here. What has been said here will be notified to the Committee of Selection when the matter is referred to it for consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Fitch. When you come to rule perhaps you could let us into the secret of how it is possible to get off this Committee at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James A. Dunn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Fitch. I think that remarks could be made here for which regret will be expressed afterwards.<br><br>
The Committee of Selection met and considered the submissions made on behalf of one of the hon. Members who was a member of this Committee and, to the best of my knowledge, this submission was supported by evidence from a doctor. The Committee took into account what submissions were made and it made a decision yesterday. That decision has appeared in the Votes and Proceedings today, and I am surprised that some hon. Members do not look at the Paper of the House in the normal way, as I am sure most hon. Members do.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Fitch. Appendix II of Votes and Proceedings states—
<br><blockquote><p>"Standing Committee J—Mr. Hugh Delargy reported from the Committee of Selection, That they had discharged from Standing Committee J Mr. John Lee (nominated in respect of the Development Land Tax Bill), and had appointed in substitution Mr. Robert Parry.".</p></blockquote>
We have no complaints whatsoever on the merits of this substitution and we appreciate and much regret the need for the replacement so far as the hon. Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Mr. Lee) is concerned. I do not by that mean anything personal against the hon. Member for Liverpool, Scotland. These appointments are reported to the House, are they not, and approved by the House as one of the last acts in any one day. That is to say, this must have occurred last night at a late hour, an hour after the Government had lost its majority on the Floor of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0840">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 503</span>
House. I think it lost its majority about 4.30 p.m. when a certain hon. Gentleman declared that he would no longer support the Government and would become independent. This appointment, although no doubt sent to the House by the Committee before 4.30 p.m., must have had the approval of the House at some time after the Government lost their majority. It is a matter about which I do not think this Committee can do anything at the moment. We have to abide by the decision of the House last night, although I submit it was a wrong decision. I would ask you, Mr. Fitch, to what extent we should make representations to the Committee of Selection to the effect that the proportion of the representation on this Committee no longer represents the proportion of the representation on the Floor of the House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Liverpool, Scotland (Mr. Parry) was appointed in a perfectly proper way by the Committee of Selection yesterday. Whether he was appointed after a certain resignation was announced or before I do not know. I certainly do not know the actual time it was agreed upon in the House, and it is none of my business. As far as I am concerned, this Committee has been properly constituted and I intend, as Chairman, to continue with the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Fitch. May I give notice, as much as one needs to give notice in a Committee of this sort, that the Opposition will wish to consider this in more detail and with reference to the authorities to see whether it is a proper matter to raise on the Floor of the House. I say this with no disrespect to you as Chairman, Mr. Fitch, and I hope you will not take it as such, but it is a point for which I know of no precedent and I think it should be carefully considered with the authorities and the Clerks of the House. We reserve our position.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Budgen</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Fitch. Am I right in thinking that this point is properly raised on the Floor of the House and not in this Committee? Is that the effect of your ruling and your advice?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 504</span>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If I may take the second point of order first, I cannot advise the Committee what to do on a matter like this. Certainly the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is perfectly in order if he wants to raise this matter on the Floor of the House. I am sure it is no disrespect to me and I certainly did not take it as such. What the House does with this is nothing to do with me.<br><br>
Can we now proceed with the Bill and Amendment No. 102?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Parry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order Mr. Fitch. May I point out that the name of my constituency is Liverpool, Scotland Exchange. Some hon. Members have dropped the word "Exchange" in referring to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I must apologise to the hon. Gentleman. I had forgotten that the two constituencies had been combined since he took on the arduous duty of representing that area of Liverpool. He is almost a neighbour of myself, but not quite.<br><br>
I beg to move Amendment No. 102, in page 99, line 30, leave out 'within the same curtilage'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take Amendment No. 103: page 99, line 32, leave out 'within the same curtilage'.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is an amendment to paragraph 5(3) which we have been discussing in previous amendments. Subparagraph (3)(<i>a</i>) states that for the purpose of the previous part of paragraph (5), which we have been discussing:
<br><blockquote><p>"where any development extends to two or more buildings within the same curtilage, those buildings may be regarded as a single building;"</p></blockquote>
Subparagraph (<i>b</i>) says:
<br><blockquote><p>"where two or more buildings within the same curtilage result from the carrying out of development of a single building, the new buildings may together be regarded as a single building.".</p></blockquote>
As to the curtilage, we do not find it defined in the Bill. Every parliamentary draftsman has always shirked—I do not mean that in any bad way—rather avoided the definition of "curtilage". We know what it means. It is that within the boundaries of an area which is used very much for the same purpose. The curtilage of a house is its garden. The curtilage of a farm is the farm buildings and those parts
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0841">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 505</span>
around the farm buildings. The curtilage of a factory, I presume, could be easily recognised. The best way to deal with this is to take an example. If there were a row of terraced houses or shops and the development affected one or two of them, the development of one end of the row by building within the curtilage of the particular house or shop would not be within the curtilage of the other houses or shops in the row. If one was carrying out a development of a row of houses or shops of that sort, the development could not be treated as the development of a single building if it took place in different parts of the terraced row.<br><br>
So it might be with a factory. It would be even more important in that case. If there were a need to develop storage for a factory, even right next door to it on the existing boundaries of the factory, it could not be within the same curtilage. So, if one were carrying out development of the factory and building an extension beyond the recognised boundaries of the factory, it would not be in the same curtilage and would not be regarded as a single building for the purpose of development.<br><br>
I speak without looking at the precedents for this, but I do not think there has been this restriction previously in similar legislation. I remember that there was considerable discussion, either on the capital gains tax or the development gains tax, on much the same point. On that occasion it was recognised that there could be development on the boundary and therefore outside the curtilage of existing premises which, when combined with development of the premises themselves could be treated as development of the same building and a single building.<br><br>
I should have thought that the way this clause is now drawn is unnecessarily restrictive on those who wish to improve their properties. All through this Bill we are considering the owner who wishes to carry out development. As I understand it the whole purpose of the schedule is not to clobber the man who is merely extending or improving his own property within certain reasonable limits.<br><br>
5.30 p.m.<br><br>
This paragraph is intended to be a relief to the chargeable person in that it will allow him to develop within the curtilage of existing buildings and to treat the development of the existing building and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 506</span>
development within the curtilage as one single building. To that extent it is a relief. It is a recognition of a reasonable development which will not result in a liability to tax. But it is unreasonable and it is restrictive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Fitch. Under Standing Order No. 63(2) am I right in thinking that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury should not be counted in the quorum?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member is quite right, but there is still a quorum.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that information. I just wanted to make sure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to hear that ruling. We shall keep count, although we welcome the Financial Secretary. He has been a very great help to the Committee. I trust that he will not be driven out of the room by any Standing Order. At the same time, I am sorry that there are not more hon. Members on his side to listen to what I am saying. It does not matter about my hon. Friends—I do not have to convince them. They are convinced that I am always right. But I have to convince Labour Members that I am right. I am sure that I am right in this case—that we ought not to have this rather petty restriction on the otherwise reasonable concession made in (3).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am horrified to say that my education leaves me ignorant of the meaning of the word "curtilage". It is not a term which we use in Scotland. I was going to corroborate my evidence with the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford) but he has left. I am afraid that the guardians of our law and our culture are not here when we need their advice. Being a simple person and being deprived of my adviser and mentor and the keeper of the national conscience, I am bound to say that it is my opinion, given without fee—I think the Minister said, "And it would not be worth a fee", but many a client has made the mistake of imagining that it was—that "curtilage" is a term which means very little if anything in the law of Scotland. It is a term which is no doubt fished out of the strange Common Law of England. If it has any meaning I should like it to be defined.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0842">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 507</span>
I should like it to be defined precisely so that we know what it means. I take it that it means that this is merely an anticipation, in this context, a piece of land in which at no point there is a break from any of the rest of it. I take it that is what it means.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend will doubtless, in view of this immediate happening, remember the text that "salvation cometh neither from the East nor the West."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think I will leave that interjection. I will look forward to the Minister giving us some education, and no doubt the Financial Secretary to the Treasury giving me—because I got that feeling from a note that was passed—a little advice.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not need the note. I had been conducting my research prior to coming to the Committee. I, too, was not quite certain of the legal definition of "curtilage". I thought that it was just the amount of land round one's home. I turned to the Concise Oxford Dictionary which was by my side and saw that it confirmed the view that I held, which is not the full legal definition, which I will read out shortly.<br><br>
The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines "curtilage" in this way: "(law, dial.). Area attached to dwelling-house". Perhaps hon. Members with wider experience will know which dialects use "curtilage". Where, for example, do people say—" I am going out to play in the curtilage this afternoon ". I myself have never heard the word used in this way, so either the Oxford English Dictionary is a little out of date or there are some pockets in this country which speak a language I know not.<br><br>
I can perhaps help the Committee with the legal meaning. In Sinclair-Lockhart's Trustees <i>v.</i> Central Land Board (1950) I.P. and C.R. 195 (affirmed 1951), Volume I Planning and Compensation Reports, page 320, the Court of Session held that—
<br><blockquote><p>"the ground which is used for the comfortable enjoyment of a house or other building may be regarded in law as being within the curtilage of that house or building and thereby as an integral part of the same although it has not been marked off or enclosed in any way. It is enough that it serves the purpose of the house or building in some necessary or reasonably useful way."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 508</span>
I think perhaps, for the purposes of the Committee, we might take our stand on the last few of those words, bearing in mind the definition that was attempted by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) which to my non-legal ears sounded much the same.<br><br>
So we see that Schedule 4, paragraph 5(3) provides that in determining whether an extension or rebuilding is material development
<br><blockquote><p>"two or more buildings within the same curtilage … may be regarded as a single building".</p></blockquote>
The amendment seeks to allow two or more buildings which may be completely separate to be rebuilt as one building, or one building to be rebuilt as two or more buildings. Such rebuilding, if the amendment were to be successful, would not be considered as material development.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister understand the definition of the word "curtilage" to include pieces of land which are not necessarily continuous or contiguous? Does he imagine, for instance, that the curtilage of this building could be on the other side of the Thames, separated by a public waterway? Or does he consider that there could be a public road in between or another piece of land belonging to another person in between?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I certainly do not intend to enter the quagmire of legal definition. I have given the definition which I had before me and I propose to take my stand on that. My English law is sufficiently adequate to deal with some of these aspects, but by no means is my knowledge of Scots law adequate to deal with any of the aspects which the hon. and learned Gentleman might put to me.<br><br>
The purpose of the curtilage test is to prevent abuse. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) asked where this provision—</span></p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S <i>attention having been called to the fact that seven Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seven Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman asked where this provision arose from. I think there was some echo in his mind of having seen something of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0843">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 509</span>
this kind before, and he seemed to be searching for it, Perhaps I can help him by saying that this legislation follows upon Schedule 3 (10) (3) of the Finance Act 1974. It follows because there is the distinct possibility of abuse and the test is to prevent the kind of abuse whereby, for example, there might be a row of terraced houses which could be rebuilt as a new block of flats and which could be within the 110 per cent. cubic content of the house.<br><br>
To take another example, if the curtilage test was not available, a number of widely separated shops in an urban renewal area could be developed as a supermarket. By any definition these must be material developments, and that is the purpose of this part of the legislation, which I hope the Committee will accept.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether this property falls within the curtilage of the discussion on the amendment, but I should like to raise one small point which gave me some bother this afternoon when I was doing a little homework. On page 55 of the Explanatory Notes, referring to paragraph (5) (3) of Schedule 4, in two places the reference to paragraph (1) (1) occurs—(1) (1) (<i>a</i>) and (1) (1) (<i>b</i>). Eventually I came to the conclusion that this must be an error for (5) (1) (<i>a</i>) and (5) (1) (<i>b</i>), and I should be grateful for confirmation of that. If it is not the case, I fail to make any sense of the situation at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I compliment my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) on having read the Explanatory Notes with such care as to find such a misprint. I have great admiration for anybody who is so devoted to the Bill as to do that.<br><br>
With respect to the Financial Secretary, I do not know that he took us any further. He referred us to Schedule 3 (10) of the Finance Act 1974, and now that I look at that paragraph I recollect it well very. I raised this very same point myself in Committee on the Finance Bill 1974, and was given an undertaking that it would be put right, that a development of this sort which was part and parcel of the development of an existing building could be treated as one building. On Report—which I recollect was very rushed and I am not sure that is was not
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 510</span>
guillotined—the extra paragraph, unnumbered, in paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 to the Finance Act 1974 was introduced with these words about curtilage. I think my recollection is correct; I certainly remember arguing the point at the time. I am still in doubt as to how much may be included within the curtilage.<br><br>
The Fianancial Secretary went very far in saying that it was an area which was used conveniently with the relevant area one is talking about. As the Prime Minister is the First Lord of the Treasury, is No. 10 within the curtilage of the Treasury buildings in Parliament Square? Can one have any building within the curtilage when it is not contiguous to or within the recognised boundaries?<br><br>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) asked this very question: can an area be within the curtilage if it is not contiguous or continuous with the relevant land? The Financial Secretary will recollect—and I return here to my old favourite quotations—that Humpty Dumpty said—
<br><blockquote><p>"There's glory for you!" "I don't know what you mean by 'glory'," Alice said. He said "I meant, 'there's a nice knock-down argument for you!'"</p></blockquote>
Indeed, the Financial Secretary no doubt thinks he has put up a nice knockdown argument, and there's glory for you? But it does not mean that he has explained to the Committee what is meant by "curtilage".<br><br>
To go on with the same reference, Humpty Dumpty then said—
<br><blockquote><p>"When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean."</p></blockquote>
and I think the Financial Secretary is saying that "curtilage" means what he means it to mean.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To do the Financial Secretary justice, he was not saying that when he used the word it meant what he said it meant; he said "It means something and I do not know what it does mean."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let me add four more words from Humpty Dumpty—
<br><blockquote><p>It means neither more nor less"</p></blockquote>
but what it means more of or less of we do not know.<br><br>
We should do far better without the word. The paragraph in the 1974 Act was nicely complete without tacking on those three lines at the end of Schedule 3(10).<br><br>

5.54 p.m.<br><br>
We should do far better without these words, and I hope the Financial Secretary will, in the fullness of his heart, accept the amendment so that we can get on with the rest of the Bill.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for talking about the fullness of my heart. It is certainly my intention wherever possible to try to grant those changes which are equable and fair to the taxpayer and accepted by those who have to deal with many of these problems. However, we must consider the revenue and, where there is an important revenue complication, the hard heart of the Treasury perhaps overcomes the fullness which the right hon. Gentleman so pleasantly sees in me.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman pointed out that the definition I gave was perhaps less strict than the legal definition. The definition on which I would rest, and on which I am sure he would rest, is the one that I quoted with the legal meaning. I certainly do not propose to give any ruling as to the curtilage of Downing Street, for example. What I can say is that these matters have been before courts of law and it is subject to a fairly strict interpretation.<br><br>
What we are talking about in the whole of these amendments which are substantially the same ones, is the necessity to prevent the kind of abuse that I mentioned. Looking back, the second example that I gave was probably the better one—that where there are several widely separated shops in an urban renewal area, the curtilage test is quite important; in developing this urban renewal area in the form of a supermarket perhaps, there is quite clearly material development there, and it is only right that such material development needs to be taxed.<br><br>
I am sorry, but I am unable to make any change of heart on that in spite of the pleas of the right hon. Gentleman which I am unable to yield to on this occasion.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 104, in page 99, line 50, at end add—
<br><blockquote><p>'(<i>d</i>) lifts and stairways'.</p></blockquote>
We are dealing here with a series of amendments which follow on fairly logically from the one which we have just
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 512</span>
discussed. In paragraph 6 of the schedule it is a question of what shall be disregarded for the purposes of calculating the 10 per cent. tolerance, which is regularly precedented in a number of Acts and which is set out in paragraph 5(1)(<i>a</i>).<br><br>
Under paragraph 6(2) the 10 per cent. tolerance includes:
<br><blockquote><p>"(a) means of escape in case of fire;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(b) car-parking or garage space;</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(c) accommodation for plant providing heating, air-condition or similar facilities."</p></blockquote>
What we seek to add in the amendment is "lifts and stairways".<br><br>
As I have said to the Committee on a number of occasions, I am not particularly familiar with the intricacies of commercial and office development, though I claim to know a little about housebuilding. But I know that rebuilding, enlarging and refurbishing of office and other forms of commercial development is an increasingly important part of modern development, particularly when local authorities have, for one reason or another, clamped down on rebuilding. In enlargement, which may mean gutting the whole building, the provision of new lifts and stairways in what are often obsolete buildings is an extremely necessary part of the redevelopment as part of getting a scheme which will be likely to attract potential tenants.<br><br>
If one is to keep within the 110 per cent. figure, which is important, if lifts and stairways are not included the developer will have a maximum incentive to economise as far as possible on them—to have the fewest possible lifts and the smallest number of staircases: in short, to make a less effective and less modern building which is less likely to attract people and to provide the sort of working conditions which office workers want.<br><br>
If our amendment were accepted, it would make a negligible difference, if any difference at all, to the revenue. But it would allow for the architect designing a refurbishing scheme within the 110 per cent. tolerance to have more scope to design proper lifts and stairways. The amendment is very reasonable. It takes account of the realities of modern development and I hope that the Government will view it sympathetically.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman says that this is a reasonable amendment. He moves all his amendments so reasonably that it is sometimes difficult for Treasury
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0845">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 513</span>
Ministers to resist. But we have to on occasions.<br><br>
Lifts and stairways are important to buildings, but the hon. Gentleman will have noted that the exemptions from the 10 per cent. in paragraph 6(1) are
<br><blockquote><p>"means of escape in case of fire; car-parking space"</p></blockquote>
and so on, in other words, matters in respect of which there are statutory obligations.<br><br>
I do not see why, although lifts and stairways are clearly necessary, we should extend the exemptions to lifts and stairways. There might be other things to which exemptions should be extended because they might be considered important for the purposes of the building.<br><br>
We are concerned, in paragraph 6(1) and (2), with obligations imposed strictly by statute such as fire escapes. We do not think that a case has been made for extending the exemptions to other assets—if that is the right word—such as lifts, stairways or others that may come to mind. These words are limited to cover the statutory obligations and I do not see that there is a case for extending them to cover lifts and stairways in general.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not mean to be offensive, but I think that that was a rotten brief. It did not distinguish lifts and staircases from the items set out in 6(2)(<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>). It may have distinguished them from:
<br><blockquote><p>"means of escape in case of fire"</p></blockquote>
in that they are statutorily governed and imposed upon an owner. Whether the Minister of State likes it or not, he has to have certain fire safety apparatus and precautions. Car-parking or garage space is to some extent enforced by a planning permission. In the redevelopment of property there may be an excess over the 10 per cent. tolerance for the purpose of car space at the request of the local authority. But how does the Minister distinguish:
<br><blockquote><p>"accommodation for plant providing heating, air conditioning or similar facilities"</p></blockquote>
from the provision of lifts and stairways? There is no difference in principle.<br><br>
The reason for including in this amendment lifts and stairways is that we are mainly considering here the development of buildings which may well not be modern and which may well have been built with a
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 514</span>
staircase only originally and not provided with lifts. No offices of more than two storeys could be let these days unless there were a lift. They would be quite unlettable. No one would dream of rebuilding offices originally built without a lift, if they are three storeys or more high, without installing a lift.<br><br>
If one installs a lift, it is almost inevitable that one has to rebuild the stairways, because normally the lift is combined in the structure of the stairways. I can see no distinction at all between:
<br><blockquote><p>"accommodation for plant providing heating, air conditioning or similar facilities"—</p></blockquote>
I stress "or similar facilities"—and the provision of lifts and stairways.<br><br>
For example, air conditioning was never to be found in old buildings, but in these days one could hardly let a modern office without air conditioning. Traffic noises are so bad that one has to have a sealed window and, therefore, proper air conditioning for working there. I imagine that the Government wish to encourage convenient and comfortable new offices. In this case could the Minister think again and agree that these modern provisions should all be included?<br><br>
I wonder that the Minister did not rise to his feet and say, "The amendment is unnecessary, the words 'or similar facilities' include lifts and stairways as being sufficiently <i>ejusdem generis</i> with heating and air-conditioning", because they are all much the same sort of installation, certainly for offices and undoubtedly for factories. I hope that he will think again about it and find that he can accept the amendment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I was overhasty in my original reaction to the hon. Gentleman's amendment. I can see the right hon. Gentleman's point in relation to similar facilities and that when we talk of air conditioning we are getting close to stairways and lifts, although air conditioning, as he recognises, is now generally installed for the welfare of employees working in the building—which does not necessarily follow in the case of lifts. There may be industrial lifts which carry goods and do not assist people working in the building, but that is a small point.<br><br>
But I think that I have been to some extent convinced by right hon. and learned Gentlemen and, although I cannot accept the amendment completely, we shall
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0846">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 515</span>
certainly see what can be done to go some way with what the hon. Gentleman requires. Perhaps I could look at the wording again, in case certain situations are brought in which we will not want to be covered by the legislation. If he is happy with that assurance, we shall look at it sympathetically and try to bring something forward on Report.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to hear that. I was amazed when I heard the hon. Gentleman talking about the statutory requirements for air conditioning. If that were so, we in the House of Commons would be continually in breach of the statutory requirements, because, as far as I know, only the Chamber has air conditioning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend will realise that, even if we are not continually in breach of statutory requirments, our wretched staff are continually overcrowded, which is in clear breach of the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be so. We are very grateful to the Minister for saying that he will look at this matter again, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 105, in page 100, line 1 leave out sub-paragraph (3).</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take the following amendments:—</span></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I first say that I mentioned in relation to an earlier amend-
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 516</span>
ment our old friend—the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. Here we are back again at 1st July 1948, which was the operational date for the Town and Country Planning Act, as I recall. Here it is rearing its ugly head in statute again. I think it is fast becoming like the time of King Edward the Confessor and the Domesday Book, before which the memory of man runneth not.<br><br>
Amendment No. 105 is concerned with the rather difficult and complicated provisions about the rebuilding of buildings since the first appointed day in July 1948. The Explanatory Notes tell us that—
<br><blockquote><p>"Where a building has been enlarged or rebuilt after 1 July 1948, the 10 per cent. tolerances refer to the original building on which those works were carried out, not the building resulting from those works."</p></blockquote>
That is a very difficult provision. Let us suppose that a building was modernised some considerable time ago. Let us suppose it was an old Victorian building, that it was modernised in the early 1950s, and that a further modernisation is now to take place. In this case, under subparagraph (3) as drafted it would be necessary to calculate the tolerances for the second alteration within the tolerances of the previous building as it existed on 1st July 1948. That seems to me to be an excessively onerous provision. I think that the fair thing to do would be to say that, if a rebuilding or alteration takes place, it should be 110 per cent. of the cubic capacity of the building as at the time the alteration or rebuilding began. That would seem to me to be a perfectly fair proposal; I think it is within the context of the Bill generally, and I am at somewhat of a loss to understand why sub-paragraph (3) has been included in the Bill in its present form. My immediate reaction on all occasions when I see a provision like that is to think it must be some anti-avoidance provision. There must be something which the Revenue has in mind which would allow fiddling to take place.<br><br>
I have on previous occasions withdrawn amendments when the Minister has convinced me that there was a genuine anti-avoidance provision in the Bill, and perhaps he will be able to do so again. However, for the moment there does not seem to be any particular reason why the 110 per cent. tolerance should not be calculated on the basis of the building as it existed at the time that the rebuilding or enlargement took place.</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0847">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 517</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: All of these amendments deal with the meaning of "original building" within the tolerance of 10 per cent. which is allowed for rebuilding within the legislation.<br><br>
Amendment No. 105 would remove subparagraph (3) completely, and so leave the meaning of "original building" completely undefined. I do not think it will come as a surprise to the hon. Gentleman if I say that I cannot go along with him that far in his argument.<br><br>
Amendment No. 107 would change the date for the application of the original building rule from 1st July 1948 to "the appointed day" for development land tax. Again, I am afraid that I could not go that far with the hon. Gentleman, because there is a gap between now and "the appointed day" and there might be occasions when it would be possible to abuse that rule in relation to carrying out works between now and the appointed day.<br><br>
Amendment No. 109 seeks to qualify the rule in paragraph 6(3), where any works of alteration or rebuilding do not result in the cubic content of the building as altered or rebuilt exceeding the cubic content—</span></p>
<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S <i>attention having been called to the fact that seven Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room, and seven Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 109, if I may return to it, would qualify the rule in paragraph 6(3) where any works of alteration or rebuilding do not result in the cubic content of the building as altered or rebuilt exceeding the cubic content of the building before those works were carried out. It would provide that such works should not constitute material development. I am advised that the amendment is unnecessary, because as the Bill is drafted such work would not constitute material development in any case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman. With the diversion a moment ago I lost track of which amendment he was referring to, and which he said was unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is Amendment No. 109, which on my advice is unnecessary because,
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 518</span>
as the Bill is drafted, such works would not constitute material development.<br><br>
With regard to the other two amendments, Amendment No. 106 would remove paragraph 8 completely and encourage people to attempt what has been called creeping development, and be given the 10 per cent. tolerance in relation to each additional 10 per cent. I could not go along with that.<br><br>
Amendment No. 108 would change the date of determining the parts of the building used for a particular purpose from 1st July 1948 to the appointed day. Again, for the reason I have given on an earlier amendment I could not accept a change of date to the appointed day.<br><br>
Not to be wholly negative, as I may have appeared to have been in relation to these five amendments, I am prepared to recommend to the Committee that we will look at this again and substitute, for 1st July 1948, the date 12th September 1974, that being the date of the publication of the White Paper. Clearly there is some time between that date and the appointed day, but, for the reasons I have given, I could not go that far. However, even if this does not go as far as the hon. Gentleman would have wished, but he is reasonably happy with the assurance that we will amend the Bill to change the date to 12th September 1974, perhaps he will consider that it goes at least part of the way and will not wish to press these amendments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was just trying to see quickly, if I may go on talking as I turn the pages, to what extent this paragraph was disclosed in the White Paper. At present I cannot discover that Schedule 4 in the White Paper included … it did, it is at the bottom of page 51.<br><br>
The Minister is correct in saying that when the White Paper was published, assuming that hon. Members went home on the night it was published, sat up in bed with their nightcap on their head or beside them on the table, as the case may be, reading it thoroughly from page to page, they have known exactly what the liability was as from that date.<br><br>
I do not think that this completely satisfies the points which my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) so properly put before the Committee. The restrictions here, taking us right back to 1st July 1948, seem unnecessary. I agree to some extent with the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0848">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 519</span>
that some restrictions here would avoid the avoidance of the tax and are probably necessary, but I certainly would have chosen a later date and allowed much more latitude in proceeding with these developments. I do not know what my hon. Friend the Member for Melton feels after he has put such a sound case before the Committee, about having it watered down so very considerably. I feel that it is worth our while to have another look at this and see exactly what the Minister said, and study it to see whether it is completely satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think <i>reculer pour mieux sauter</i> is the best policy here. We certainly want to think about this matter again. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 110, in page 100, line 7, at end insert—
<br><blockquote><p>'(6) In determining for the purpose of subparagraph (1)(<i>a</i>) or subparagraph (1)(<i>b</i>) of paragraph 5 above, whether or not the cubic content of the original building has been exceeded by more than 1/10th—
<ol>
<li>the building resulting from the carrying out of the development shall be deemed not to include any residential accommodation which has been included in the development at the request of a local authority to enable planning consent for the development to be granted; and</li>
<li>any change of use of part of the building which was required by a local authority to enable planning consent to be obtained shall be ignored'.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
Here we deal with two specific and quite frequent circumstances, which is the question of a planning gain. Again referring to the 110 per cent. tolerance—the ability to extend or enlarge the building by up to 10 per cent, without incurring development land tax—we are suggesting here two circumstances in which this should be increased. They are set out in subparagraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>). I will deal with each in turn.<br><br>
In the case of (<i>a</i>), if the building is extended this
<br><blockquote><p>"shall be deemed not to include any residential accommodation which has been included in the development at the request of a local authority to enable planning consent for the development to be granted."</p></blockquote>
It may well be that the Minister will say that
<br><blockquote><p>"to enable planning consent for the development to be granted"</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 520</span>
is not very happy wording, because clearly the provision of any particular form or accommodation does not of itself enable planning consent to be granted. Planning consent is granted by the whim or otherwise of the local authority, subject to the ruling of the Secretary of State on appeal if a refusal notice is granted.<br><br>
We all know what is in mind here. The Minister will appreciate what is in mind here. A frequent circumstance in development—both my right hon. Friend and my hon. Friend for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) well know this—is where a developer goes along to the local authority and says that he wants planning permission for an office building, or whatever, and the local authority says that it is sorry, it is difficult, and it does not think that can be done. The developer then suggests that he might include some council or even private housing as part of the scheme and the local authority says that is a different matter. After the horse-trading which takes place on these occasions, a condition is inserted into the planning permission that some residential accommodation shall be provided.<br><br>
When I was on the Westminster City council from 1968 to 1971 we did exactly this in Soho. We gave permission for a commercial development scheme which included some council housing. That was when land was at £250,000 an acre. I think I am right in saying that was one of the very few council housing schemes in the centre of London which has accrued an immediate profit to the ratepayers because it was part of a planning gains scheme.<br><br>
It is those circumstances, as set out in subparagraph (<i>a</i>) of the amendment, where the local authority is part of a planning gains deal with a developer who has put in some residential accommodation, that should be excluded for the purposes of the 110 per cent. tolerance. I think it is very reasonable proposal.<br><br>
The second leg of the argument, in subparagraph (<i>b</i>), is that
<br><blockquote><p>"any change of use of part of the building which was required by a local authority to enable planning consent to be obtained shall be ignored."</p></blockquote>
I shall not make the same points about "required". The meaning is quite clear, even if the drafting is not entirely happy. Again, it is quite frequent that the local authority when approached by a developer for, say, a shopping scheme or an office development will say that it thinks that there should be some doctors' surgeries
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0849">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 521</span>
here, or possibly even some accommodation for the council, say a housing aid centre or a sports centre, which would involve a change of use if it was not a redevelopment scheme but a substantial enlargement and conversion scheme. In both these cases there are the sorts of social circumstance where developers want to meet public requirements for public utilities as part of planning permission.<br><br>
I realise that the Minister may say that again there are possibilities for avoidance here. But I would draw his attention to the wording in the amendment—
<br><blockquote><p>"(<i>a</i>) … at the request of a local authority …</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>(<i>b</i>) … required by local authority …".</p></blockquote>
In both cases we are saying that these are things which the local authority wanted to be done. If the amendment is not conceded, it will be increasingly difficult for developers within the circumstances of the 110 per cent. tolerance to be able to make any provision at all. If they find themselves taken outside the 110 per cent. tolerance as the result of a planning gain deal, it will obviously make the planning gain deal itself increasingly unviable and they will probably feel unable to afford them; and in that circumstance the community will be the poorer. I hope that the amendments are clear and that they will find favour with the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to intervene other than briefly to support the amendment which was moved clearly and ably by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). It is increasingly likely that the types of requirements that he outlined will occur. The Government encourage co-operaton between local authorities and developers. In many cases, that co-operation can take the form of an introduction into a rebuilding scheme of facilities of the type to which he has referred, or even change of use. Amongst the changes of user which might be required, not necessarily in central London, but in other places, is the change of user of a ground floor to a car parking provision, as a requirement of the local authority.<br><br>
Therefore, I hope that the Minister will regard the amendment with favour because, if it is not included, damage will
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 522</span>
be done to the co-operation between the developer and the planning authority, and it will be the community—to use a word that found favour, even if misuse, in connection with the Community Land Act—that will be the poorer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has made the purpose of his amendment clear. It is to give some relief within the 10 per cent. tolerance, in this case to developments where a developer will enter into the construction of residential property to satisfy the local authority and to get planning permission for other development that he wanted to carry out. This also relates to a change of user situation.<br><br>
I have sat here and listened sympathetically, but I cannot see why in this situation the 10 per cent. tolerance should be applied. I can see that in some cases a developer might suffer, in the sense that he would not want to carry out the local authority side of the development. But he would suffer only in the sense that carrying out that obligation would depress the value of his land and his development. He would also pay less tax. If, as the hon. Gentleman says, this affects the development adversely, it will affect the value of the development. If it affects the value of the development in the sense of depreciating its value, less tax is payable, and the developer gets his recompense in that way.<br><br>
If, on the other hand, the development which he is carrying out at the request of the local authority is profitable, as it could be in sole cases, if he makes a development profit on it I see no reason why he should not pay tax on it. In either situation I do not see why we should add another 10 per cent. tolerance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister of State is always talking as though all development was carried out by a nasty and dangerous species called developers. I wish that he would bear in mind that, apart from the fact that the species is entirely benevolent, or as largely benevolent as any other species, a great deal of development is carried out by owners of property for their own continued use, and redevelopment is a very common kind of development which falls within this category. If he is saying that the things to which my hon. Friend referred will reduce the value of the building, that is not the point. It would bring the redevelopment

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 523</span>
within the context of the Bill. He does not seem to be answering that point at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not quite sure whether the hon. Gentleman is making a speech or an intervention, but the point that I was making was that I do not see why, within the area of 10 per cent. tolerance, we should bring in this situation. We have had other arguments previously on this point.<br><br>
I accept that developers are, in the main, people who assist society. I was not referring to them in a derogatory way; and I do not think that I have done so in this Committee. But if a developer's development is depressed and depreciated in value as a result of his accepting what might be an onerous obligation, he does not bear any tax or liability in respect of that; in fact, the value of his development is reduced.<br><br>
If, on the other hand, by undertaking such an onerous obligation the developer still makes some money out of it, I do not see why he should not be taxed on it. Either way, I do not see that the developer suffers; and I do not see why it is necessary to give this extra tolerance of 10 per cent. which the hon. Gentleman requires. I do not think that there is a real problem here. Developers are catered for in this case and they will pay no more tax than they would otherwise pay under the proposals that we are putting forward. I am sorry if I appear to be unsympathetic, but for the moment I cannot see the justice of the hon. Gentleman's case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister of a recognition of the principle in the amendment, when we were dealing with an amendment earlier today on Schedule 3, where it is already said in the Bill that where
<br><blockquote><p>"planning permission for the development of the land in which that interest subsists or subsisted has been granted subject to a condition regulating the development or use of other land …</p></blockquote>
then it is an expenditure on improvements which is recognised as such.<br><br>
There was a recognition in the acceptance of the principle of an amendment which was moved to that paragraph. The Minister recognised that, where conditions are imposed on a developer, whether it be development for his own purpose or development for disposal to someone else, there are occasions when he is required to do certain things by the planning authority
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 524</span>
or the local authority, and that it should be recognised that that is the fact even though it may enhance the property and that the developer should not be penalised for carrying out the requests of the local authority.<br><br>
I appreciate the Minister's arguments that, if there is a substantial increase in value and the owner of the land does gain by carrying out the local authority's requirements, it is logical that he should suffer the tax on that development as he would suffer it on any other form of development out of which he makes a gain.<br><br>
From the practical point of view, if this provision remains, it will be a deterrent to agreements between local authorities and developers whereby the developer provides something for the community. In the case which was quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), undoubtedly the result was beneficial to the community. Even if one cannot go the whole way and say that the developer be relieved of tax on all the gain that he makes out of complying with the requirements of the local authority, we ought to recognise that there should be some encouragement to this sort of agreement with the local authority.<br><br>
The developer when carrying out these requirements is entirely in the hands of the local authority. It is something of a gamble whether he will make any gain out of it when he has to rely on the decisions of the local authority about the use of the property which he is providing by its requirement. Many developers may well not be prepared to go ahead with the development when that requirement is imposed and when they think that they will be penalised in tax if they carry out the wishes of the local authority to provide some extra accommodation or change of use for the benefit of the community.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Melton said that he was not necessarily wedded to the wording of the amendment. We have to struggle to put the right amendment on the Notice Paper and, if it raises the points which we wish to make in a debate, we have gone as far as we can be expected to go. Therefore, there may be some way in which an appropriate amendment could be drafted to take into account the sort of thing I have in mind—that is, the encouragement of developers and owners of property to provide, at the request of the local authority or the planning
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0851">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 525</span>
authority, amenities for the benefit of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I cannot add much to what has been said. The right hon. Gentleman in part, in the modest and measured way in which he spoke, indicated that we have gone a long way to meet the point, not only on the general principle that, if there is no gain there is no tax and if there is a gain the tax is to be paid, but in the legislation itself. Where conditions are imposed and those conditions affect the current use value or the value of other land, the legislation takes that into account.<br><br>
If a developer makes a gain, albeit because of an obligation imposed upon him by a local authority, I do not see why, because that gain arises as a result of an obligation—after all, it is still a gain—he should get this further extra exemption from taxation. If it has depressed the value of his land, he gets a reduction accordingly in the valuation.<br><br>
I am sorry, but I cannot go along with the amendment for that reason. These situations are catered for in the legislation. I do not see what it has to do with cubic content. As far as I can see, it has very little to do with this part of the legislation and it would be extremely artificial to seek to insert it in this part of the legislation, quite apart from the other arguments against it. Therefore, I cannot go along with the hon. Member's amendment nor recommend the Committee to accept it.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
<p><i>Question proposed,</i> That this schedule be the Fourth Schedule to the Bill.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have had a good discussion on the amendments to Schedule 4 and have dealt to a great extent with both the details and the principle of Schedule 4. There is one major principle, however, which has not been touched on much in the debate on the amendments. It is that if we are too restrictive in the definitions of
<br><blockquote><p>"Current Use Value and Material Development"</p></blockquote>
and if we put too many
<br><blockquote><p>"Limitations on Assumptions as to Planning Permission in Determining Current Use Value"—</p></blockquote>
I read the heading to Part I of the schedule—we shall force the owners of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 526</span>
property to refrain from development and concentrate on what is now known as refurbishing. I am sure that those in the Treasury know well from experience that the development gains tax itself—and even before that, perhaps, the capital gains tax—has resulted in an enormous number of firms springing up which carry out refurbishment. Until these taxes were introduced I do not think I had ever heard the word in reference to property.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The former American Ambassador.</span></p>
<p>6.30 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Quite right. It is unfortunate, perhaps that the minds of those who wish to keep their properties as modern as possible turn at once to refurbishing. I am sure that the Treasury and the Board of Inland Revenue are most concerned to examine each project to see whether it is truly refurbishing or whether it is a project of material development. The tighter we make this schedule and the less we recognise legitimate modernisation of buildings, the more we shall have this "phoney" refurbishment, not to the advantage of our commercial and industrial assets but just to touch them up for a time in the hope that at some time some Government will remove the tax.<br><br>
We have said from the Opposition benches that we have no objection to gains from property being taxed. Our legislation did that to some extent and, as we have been reminded again and again by those on the Government benches, Lord Barber's propositions over taxation of development gains were very much the same as the legislation which is now on the Statute Book and, to some extent, the Bill before us.<br><br>
There are those who believe that, if they wait long enough, there will be no tax on development gains and therefore they go on with refurbishing. I believe that they will be disappointed. That is why I hope that we can leave as much scope as possible for modernisation of buildings without saying that every act of modernisation is a project of material development which will bring down the tax upon the head of the owner of the property.<br><br>
When one studies Schedule 4 with that sort of idea at the back of one's mind, one finds that it is pettily restrictive in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0852">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 527</span>
many cases. It is a schedule which to a great extent is a repeat of a similar schedule in the Finance Act 1974. I argued at the time that that was far too restrictive and that we should have efforts at refurbishing instead of modernising in a decent way; and my words have come true.<br><br>
I hope that, on consideration of the Committee stage of the Bill, the Treasury Ministers will see whether they can recognise a little better, particularly in Schedule 4, that they ought to encourage reasonable modernisation of buildings without saying that such acts are projects of material development bringing down the tax on the head of the owners.<br><br>
There is one small drafting matter. The very opening words of Schedule 4(1) are:
<br><blockquote><p>"The provisions of this Part of this Schedule shall have effect notwithstanding anything in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of subsection (2) of section 7 of this Act—"</p></blockquote>
I get the impression that one parliamentary draftsman drafted Clause 7 and another parliamentary draftsman came along to draft Schedule 4 and he said, "To hell with the first parliamentary draftsman. I am going to draft a law now and I am going to say at the outset of Schedule 4 that there is no need to look at Clause 7; never mind what is in Clause 7; just stick to Schedule 4."<br><br>
Unless that is what it means, I use the phrase of my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) and say that this is tautology. I hope that there will be some explanation of why it is there at all. It is extremely confusing for anyone who tries to read the Bill with two pages open at once. I am sure that many of us have tried to read the Bill with about 10 pages open at once. I have run out of all my fingers when I try to read the cross references in the Bill. When one has struggled with these cross references, one is told "Do not worry about Clause 7: scrub it out, you have to look only at Schedule 4 because, whatever is said in Clause 7, Schedule 4 prevails—the decision of the editor is final."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that, if the editor's decision were final, he would say that this Bill must now cease, but I fear he will not.<br><br>
I should like to put two points to the Minister. There is a difference in paragraph 5(1)(<i>c</i>) from the Finance Act 1974
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 528</span>
wording. The wording in the Finance Act 1974 is:
<br><blockquote><p>"the use of land for agriculture or forestry, the use of buildings occupied with the land so used or building or other operations required for such use;"</p></blockquote>
I am not clear as to why this is now changed to—
<br><blockquote><p>"the carrying out on any land used for the purposes of agriculture or forestry of any building or other operations required for the purposes of that use."</p></blockquote>
The language in the Bill seems to be less elegant than the Finance Act 1974 version. I hope that there is not some subtle difference which will be to the detriment of agriculture or forestry.<br><br>
My second point relates to the classes used in paragraph 7, in Part II, which again derive from the ones in the Finance Act 1974. I believe that in this case there is an almost exact correspondence. I was not party to the discussions on Class B in the Finance Bill Committee, if there were any, but I should like to inquire whether in this context Class B includes use as a restaurant. One of the features of the retail scene these days is the relatively frequent change of use of premises from a shop to a service user, possibly a bank or a building society but also to a restaurant; and equally there are changes back. I think it would be desirable that Class B should cover that category of change, but of course a restaurant is a separate user class from a retail shop. Therefore it is not clear to me that it is so covered as the Bill is drafted.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) indicated that he was not at all happy with the way the assumptions were made for the valuation of current use value in relation to this schedule. We could argue about that, but I would point out to him that, as he will appreciate, in fact the schedule and the assumptions in many cases help the taxpayer because they increase the current use value. In other words, assumptions about planning mean that the value of those assumptions—if that is the right way of putting it—are included in current use value and that increases the base value of the property for the purpose of tax. We think that a 10 per cent. tolerance is reasonable for cubic capacity.<br><br>
I take the point the right hon. Gentleman made about the need for modernisation,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0853">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 529</span>
but I think that 10 per cent. is fair. In most of these cases in practice I think it will be found that they work out quite fairly.<br><br>
The right hon. Gentleman raised a drafting point regarding the first paragraph of the schedule and the reference back to Clause 7(2). Far be it from me in this Committee at a few minutes' notice to try to improve upon the draftsman's drafting. The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) indicated that this particular draftsman was less elegant in his work than the draftsman of the Finance Act 1974. That is a matter of opinion. The draftsman has a very difficult task and, as I said previously, perhaps a Bill drafted by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or the Housebuilders' Federation would be even less elegant than this one—[<i>Interruption.</i>]—Or we might comply a bit better with Scots law if the hon. Gentleman had been involved in it.<br><br>
I was asked about restaurants and retail shops. Restaurants are included in the wording "retail shops" for the purpose of this legislation.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hove also asked me about agriculture and why the language was slightly different. I am told that the wording in this legislation is more in line with Planning Act legislation because of the link with the Community Land Act 1975; so the answer is that the draftsman has attempted to bring the wording into line with the Community Land Act, whereas the Finance Act 1974 wording naturally was not drafted with the Community Land Act in mind.<br><br>
That is the advice which I have been given. Like all schedules, this one is complicated, though perhaps not as complicated as some. We believe that it will operate fairly so that the developer is given all the tolerances for the purpose of increasing current use value and that will reduce his tax under this particular legislation.</span></p>

REALISED DEVELOPMENT VALUE: SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 63, in page 78, leave out lines 25 to 30.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 530</span>
It is helpful on this occasion if one turns to the ochre book to see what it is that this subparagraph is meant to cover. It says very succinctly—I would almost say elegantly—
<br><blockquote><p>"where the relevant interest includes a lease which has merged with another interest, the merged lease is to be treated as remaining in existence until its presumed expiry date so forming a 'part' of the assembly."</p></blockquote>
We are often in the Bill faced with the requirement that we treat words as having a meaning different from their normal meaning; we treat clauses as having no application to some other part because we are told later on that they should not, and we are told that things that are clearly not so should be regarded as being so. I should like therefore briefly and succinctly to ask the Minister why on this occasion should we be required to regard a situation that is not in existence as continuing in existence because the advantage even to the sometimes avaricious hand of the Revenue is not apparent to me.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Gentleman that this particular subparagraph to which his amendment refers is not there as a result of the grasping hand of the Revenue. It is to enable the occasionally grasping taxpayer—there are a few—to obtain some benefit which he would not otherwise get. The wording arises because of the well-known legal principle with which he will be well familiar as a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors that if the owner of a lease, for instance, acquires the freehold reversion, the two merge.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>rose—</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. and learned Gentleman is about to ask me about Scots law, may I finish this point? Where the owner of a lease acquires a freehold reversion, the two merge so that in fact the lease disappears because the same person cannot own the lease and the reversion of the lease.<br><br>
I am advised that, if the amendment were accepted, and if we could not treat the cost of acquisition of the lease separately from the cost of the acquisition of the reversion and merely treat it as one interest, the cost of acquisition of the reversion or indeed the lease would not be allowable when it came to a disposal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0854">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 531</span>
of the land because the one would merge into the other. Apparently a subsequent disposal of the freehold would not be a disposal of an assembly since the lease will have disappeared on the merger and:
<br><blockquote><p>"the whole of the rights which make up the relevant interest"</p></blockquote>
would refer only to the freehold interest which is acquired first in paragraph 1 (1).<br><br>
Paragraph 1 (4) is therefore necessary to preserve the lease, for the purposes of the Bill, as if it had not merged: in other words, to give the developer credit for the cost of the acquisition of the lease and keep it in existence for these purposes. Otherwise, because of the merger of the two interests, I understand that he would not be given the cost of that acquisition, so the purpose of this subparagraph is to give him that relief which is due to him. If the amendment were accepted, he would be denied that relief.</span></p>
<p>6.45 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I have become cautious about assuming that any word in the Bill has any meaning which anybody who has been educated in England thought that it had. Therefore, I was not quite sure what the word "acquire" would mean. It seems that the Minister is giving the word "acquire" the meaning of "acquire"—in other words, that one buys the lease. He will know that in Scotland, we do not have this phenomenal concept that appears in England, whereby one pays a large amount of money in order to buy a leasehold, and then, at the end of a certain period, one finds that what one has bought belongs to someone else. In Scotland we have a very simple situation. If one buys it, it belongs to one. If it is hired, it is given back to the owner when one has finished hiring it. That is what we call "leased". Therefore, there is no such concept in Scotland as acquiring—that is, purchasing, which I take it is meant—a leasehold. Therefore, at least if the Minister is not going to accept the amendment as it stands, as I think he should, I trust we shall have an assurance that this subsection, which does not apply to any situation which relates to Scotland, will be excepted from application to Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that I begin to understand what the clause is meant to mean. The Minister explained it in terms
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 532</span>
of English law at least, I hasten to add to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn), rather more clearly than either the Explanatory Notes or the wording of the Bill. As far as I can see, what the has said is that the costs of the acquisition of a leasehold interest shall be taken into account in determining the value of the costs of an interest, in spite of the fact that the acquisition costs have extinguished that leasehold interest altogether. This could be going either up or down. It could be a superior leasehold interest or an inferior leasehold interest.<br><br>
I am interested in the concept that one cannot do that in Scotland, because I would have thought that even in Scotland there would be occasions when a landlord would wish to purchase the balance of a leasehold interest held by his tenant, and so extinguish that interest. If one cannot do it as a landlord, it seems to make property development in Scotland altogether difficult. Perhaps that is why so many of them still live in council houses.<br><br>
I suggest to the Minister that, if the subsection means what he says it means—which I am sure it is intended to mean—he should ask somebody to look at it to see whether it can be put more clearly. That meaning did not jump out of the pages to persons more expert than I who have read it. I should explain to the Minister that I am a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, but I am what is known as a non-professional member, and if I were regarded perhaps more honourably I would be known as an honorary member.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that the hon. Gentleman accepts that this is a beneficial subsection—although he is not entirely happy with the drafting—because at least to a non-professional member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, this is not immediately apparent. I cannot give him an undertaking to simplify the paragraph. I think it is reasonably clear at least to people who work in this field most of their time, and I think he will probably realise this on reflection.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn), who mentioned Scots law, said that we do not have anything as nasty as leases in Scotland. If there are no such things as leases, and if leases are not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0855">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 533</span>
interests in land but instead contracts such as hire contracts, presumably one interest does not merge into the other and the problem does not arise in Scotland. He should be glad that this is so and that he does not have to worry about this subsection, because these concepts are quite foreign to the law of Scotland. Therefore, because of the peculiar situation that can arise in English law, where a lease is something more than a contract and something which then can merge into freehold, we have to provide for it. If that situation does not arise in Scotland, we need not worry about it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There is a considerable difference. In England there is a concept of leasehold, whereby one first buys the right to lease the property; that is, one buys the right to lease, say, No. 23, Devonshire Terrace, for 99 years. One then pays the rent as well. In Scotland one enters into a contract to pay the rent but one does not acquire what in England is a separate concept of leasehold. It is because the language is inappropriate, in that we do not acquire leasehold—we enter into a lease—but to use the expression " acquire a lease" is again an inappropriate definition of the situation. If it means, in terms of a lease in Scotland, that those who enter into a lease of a property will have the value of the remaining years aggregated in the event of their becoming owners or whatever the situation is, that is one thing. But that is not what it says. This is conceived entirely in the concept of purchasing or acquiring the leasehold, which is a different situation and a very different system. I have always thought it was a rather more honest one.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the Minister's explanation of the meaning I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
<p><i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 64, in page 78, line 31, leave out paragraph 2.<br><br>
Again I think it is helpful to turn to the Explanatory Notes, which are very brief on paragraph 2:
<br><blockquote><p>"In certain circumstances the grant of a lease out of two or more separate interests is to be regarded as two or more separate part disposals. The consideration for the grant of the lease is apportioned between the separate interests (under clause 4(5))."</p></blockquote>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 534</span>
Once again I am minded to ask why. It seems to me that if one can have land assembly out of freehold interest, there is no reason why one cannot have land assembly out of leasehold interest. It is helpful in this case—I think it is almost unique in the whole Bill that in paragraph 2(1), after the initial statement:
<br><blockquote><p>"If and so far as a lease of any land is lawfully granted by a landlord who has a different interest in one part of the land as compared with another—"</p></blockquote>
we actually have an explanation in the text of the Bill what it is all about:
<br><blockquote><p>"(as where he is the lessee under one lease of a part of the land and the lessee under a different lease of another part).".</p></blockquote>
For once a mere honorary member of the Royal Institution can understand what it is that we are getting at. I think that the Minister may find himself in the same condition as I am. I would ask why, if that particular interest has been assembled by the assembly of leasehold interests, should it not be treated in exactly the same way as if it constitutes an interest and has been assembled out of a number of freehold interests or, indeed, a mixture of freehold and leasehold interests. The question I would put to the Minister—and I would regard this as a probing amendment—is why we need this paragraph at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman indicated that this is a probing amendment. I will try to assist him in his probing and will read from my brief, which explains clearly the purpose of the paragraph.<br><br>
Paragraph 2 provides that when a lease is granted over land in which the landlord has different interests—two separate leases, for example—the grant is treated as separate part disposals of the separate interests. Apparently paragraph 2 deals with a difficulty which has arisen out of a recent case in the High Court. That is why the draftsman had to incorporate this particular paragraph. That case had the splendid name of Dodson Bull <i>v.</i> The City of London. I could give the hon. and learned Gentleman a reference if he desired—1975 AELR p. 497—it is an English case. That case holds that a lease can be validly granted over land in which the grantor has two or more different interests; for example, a lease of one part and a different lease of the other part. The case was concerned with the operation of the Landlord and Tenant
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I0856">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 535</span>
Act 1954, and I am told that it appears from the judgment that the point on the different bases of the landlord's title was never taken. Nevertheless, this is a judgment that we have to take into account.<br><br>
The rules in Part III of the Schedule, concerning leases and reversions on leases, would not work satisfactorily where a lease is granted out of land in which the grantor has different interests.<br><br>
Paragraph 2 provides for the grant to be treated as separate part disposals of the separate interests instead of a single part disposal out of an assembly. It also provides for consideration for the grant of the lease to be apportioned on a just and reasonable basis between the separate part disposals and for any other necessary apportionments—for example, the incidental costs of disposals.<br><br>
The paragraph arises out of a decision taken recently by the courts. Whether it was a correct decision is not for us to say, but the draftsman has to take it into
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 536</span>
account and has had to draft this paragraph as a result. If it had not been taken, it might not have been necessary to include the paragraph. I hope that that explanation is sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation and for the references at which I am sure those most closely interested will look. It seems unfortunate, because it will make the liability to tax in cases of this sort a little more complicated and lengthy. But in the light of his explanation and reserving my position in case Mr. Dodson or Mr. Bull would like to decide otherwise, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</span></p>
