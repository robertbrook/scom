	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i>—	<i>(23rd March)</i>—No. 3, in page 2, line 4, to leave out the words

	<p>—[	<i>Mr. Budgen.</i>]</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that we are discussing also the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>	<br><blockquote><p>No. 4, in page 2, line 5, leave out '80' and insert '60'.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>No. 32, in page 2, line 5, at end add 'or such lesser rate as may be prescribed by the Treasury by statutory instrument a draft of which has been laid before and approved by a resolution of the Commons House of Parliament'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are in the course of debating Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 32, which deal with the rate of development land tax as set out in the Bill, and I do not wish to detain the Committee any longer from hearing the Minister's reply to the points already made. I merely say that of course we recognise that any tax on the disposal of any commodity is bound to be some sort of deterrent, if only a partial one. Our case on this is that the rate—whether 66⅔ per cent. for a certain part of the development value disposed of, or the full 80 per cent.—is almost a full deterrent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are supported in that view not only by the Treasury and the Secretary of State himself, by the reduction from 80 per cent. to 66⅔ per cent. over a certain part of the development value—and, indeed, by his giving the reason for the reduction as being that the higher rate would have caused a dry-up in the suply of land, or so he was advised. We also have the support of the professional bodies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case put by those who will actually be dealing in the land is a good one, but it is obviously suspect because they are pleading that they be relieved of a certain
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
amount of tax. But the professional bodies—those who have to operate in this field, not in the actual buying and selling of land to or from themselves, but in their professional capacity acting for others, also support a much lower figure than that in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether one takes the lower figure at 50 per cent. or 60 per cent. is not, I believe, very material to the debate at this stage. We are putting the case that we think that the figure chosen by the Government is far too high, and that, according to the advice which we and the Government have received from the professional bodies, the figures should be between 50 per cent. and 60 per cent.; that is the point we are arguing with this amendment, and in order to be entirely co-operative and willing to compromise on this, we have put the figure at 60 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point is that, if in fact this tax is imposed at the rate desired by the Government, and if it does cause a dry-up in the supply of land, the only alternative put forward by the Government is that local authorities with enough money to bring forward sufficient land to meet may then be distributed to those wishing to develop it. That is an entirely impractical suggestion for the period during which this transitional tax is intended to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Public Expenditure White Paper—the statement of the Government's intention about public expenditure—makes it perfectly clear that they will not be prepared over the next few years to provide local authorities with enough money to bring forward sufficient land to meet demands. Even if the Government were prepared to do that, the delays, and indeed the increase in staff of local authorities and the expenditure of applying compulsory purchase over a wide area, would cause chaos to the whole industry of land development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to say at once that we are discussing only the rate of tax for this period before the second appointed day. We are wholly opposed, and put forward no compromise whatever, to the second appointed day when the whole of the development value will be confiscated by the Government. So we are dealing only with the transitional stage now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two procedural points should be mentioned. We are debating three amendments and I hope that you will allow us, Mr. Fitch, to choose Amendment No. 4, which indicates the point of the debate
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
best and most succinctly, on which to have a Division.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 32 would allow a variation in the rate of tax with an affirmative resolution of the House. It is put forward as a tentative suggestion because there may be a time when a Government would wish to make a quick alteration in the rate of tax in order to deter or encourage, as the case may be, a particular kind of development. As it stands, the amendment does not say that the rate can be varied geographically or for particular purposes, but that is the intended implication of the amendment. It is not unusual that a rate of tax can be altered by a draft order put before the House and subject to affirmative resolution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be that when the Government see the effects of this tax, they will wish to encourage development in urban areas as against development in what we call the green field sites. It might be that, in order to provide that encouragement, one would allow a lower rate of tax on urban development. It is a tentative suggestion and is put forward to discover what the Government think about being given this flexibility for altering the rate, not behind the back of Parliament in any way, but by bringing it forward on a draft order for the approval of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not delay the Committee further. I intended only to sum up on those two points and to refer to the procedural points. I hope we shall hear from the Minister on the questions raised by my hon. Friends during the debate at our last meeting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Paymaster-General (Mr. Edmund Dell)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I thank you, Mr. Fitch, for changing our meeting place? It may be considered appropriate by the Opposition that in debating this Bill we should take up less room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have inevitably had something of a Second Reading debate on these amendments. I am discouraged, in replying to the debate, to learn that the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) is already thinking of a Division before he has heard my arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall not have a Division if the Government give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is so persuasive that the Opposition may decide not to divide. It is always discouraging for a Minister when answering a debate to hear
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
that nothing he can say can possiblly persuade the other side.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me very quickly deal with Amendment No. 32 before coming to the main subject of our debate. I understand that this amendment does not command the unanimous enthusiasm of the Opposition. In fact, the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), whose name appears as supporting the amendment, has since denounced it as being inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is certainly true that in the past Parliament, through the regulatory power, has allowed Governments to bring orders before the House to change certain rates of tax in both directions. But this amendment suggests a change only in one direction. In any case, I am surprised that the Opposition should be suggesting this considerable increase in the power of the Executive as compared with Parliament. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West thinks that it is necessary for Parliament to have great control over the Executive and would be reluctant to see this power given. My judgment is that it is not necessary. After all, we have at least one Finance Bill a year—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At least!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Therefore there are opportunities to deal with the sort of situation the Opposition foresee. I would not, therefore, recommend the Committee to accept either this amendment or a redrafted amendment to give the Government power to increase the rate of tax by order. The House should have an opportunity to debate these matters in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the questions raised during the debate which is fundamental to all our discussions is whether it is possible to distinguish between a development profit and an entrepreneurial profit. A number of hon. Gentlemen have suggested that it is not possible so to distinguish. I say that it is fundamental because, unless one can distinguish between the two, any rate of tax higher than the ordinary rate of corporation tax cannot be justified. That applies as much to a 60 per cent. rate of tax as to an 80 per cent. rate of tax. In accepting the principle of a special tax on development values the Opposition are, in principle, accepting the possibility of making this distinction. We think that in the Bill we have succeeded in making this distinction. It is a matter which we will have to discuss later to see how successful we have been in mak-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>49</span>
ing a distinction which is fundamental to the whole operation, and it would be better if the question were discussed in more detail on later amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the question of how we decide what is an appropriate rate of tax on development values. I start with a matter of principle. It seems right to the Government that, as development value is created by the community, in principle there should be no objection to any rate of tax the State may decide in acting for the community. Here is a value not created by entrepreneurial activity. It is created by the community, which is entitled to decide what proportion of that value should be recovered for the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a question of punitive rates. Hon. Gentlemen introduced high moral attitudes into the discussion. It is not a question of the State disliking particular activities. It is a question of the right of the community to recover for itself a value which it creates. It is, therefore, appropriate that Parliament should decide the rate of tax; and whatever tax it decides could, in principle, be justified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not a uniquely Socialist attitude. It is an attitude which has permeated a wide spectrum of political thinking for at least 100 years. Hon. Gentlemen from time to time, and whenever they dislike something, say "This is an example of dogmatism, Socialism, and so on." There are contradictions among the Opposition as to what is Socialism and what is not. On Second Reading the hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) said that a flat rate was a peculiarly Socialist conception. The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury), on the other hand, accepted a flat rate as a desirable conception. I think that in Committee, hon. Gentlemen should concentrate on the issues rather than on the abuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept—and I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends accept—that there is a great deal in what the right hon. Gentleman says about the creation of values other than by entrepreneurial means. The Paymaster-General is no doubt familiar with the survey of land availability in the South-East which showed quite clearly that a large amount of land becomes available for housing development as a result of being identified by those concerned with the development of housing which would not become available were
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
they not active in this field, because local authorities are just not able to, or perhaps not prepared to, identify and zone this land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the right hon. Gentleman recognise that, whereas broadly there is some truth in his allegations, a great deal of land would not become available for development were it not for entrepreneurial activity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may not be surprised to hear that I am about to come to that point. Having stated the principle which I think must be right, I have now reached the practice. No Government can neglect the practical effects of their action, particularly in a market situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to the speech made at our last meeting by my hon. Friend for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett). I think that he was right to suggest that, in a market situation, a tax is bound to have an effect on the supply of land. The right hon. Member for Crosby this morning said the same. The truth of the matter is that that principle applies to a tax at any level. One must expect that there will be some effects on the supply of land particularly in a market situation. This is true of 80 per cent., as it is true of 60 per cent. Probably at 80 per cent. it is more true than at 60 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this assessment is correct. I make these comments on it. First, we do not know what the effect will be. We cannot calculate it accurately on the evidence available, mainly because recent economic circumstances have confused the effect of the development gains charge. We do not know what the effect of the development gains charge on the supply of land has been because it has been operating at a time when there has been a marked fall in land prices and general low economic activity. Therefore, no one can be sure of the effect on the supply of land of the development land tax or of rates of tax such as the Government propose or, indeed, as the Opposition propose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed that the right hon. Gentleman in making his remarks this morning used an interesting phrase. I noted it, as it seemed to me to be striking. He said "If this rate of tax does cause a dry-up in the supply of land …". He said "If", so even the right hon. Gentleman in his position as advocate for this rate of tax, is not absolutely sure what the effect will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members opposite have said that the Treasury is not primarily the Department concerned with land supply and that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
this is a matter for the Department of the Environment. That is true. But I can assure hon. Members opposite that the Treasury is interested in the effects of its actions, although they may sometimes doubt it. We have considered the problem seriously and in the course of considering the Bill have had a number of confidential consultations with eminent figures in this industry. I was interested in their view, which was not a certain view. Like the right hon. Gentleman, they did not say "This will certainly have this effect". They said that it would probably have this effect. It is a matter of judgment. No one really knows what the degree of the effect will be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lessons I derive from this analysis are these. They are not the lessons which hon. Members opposite derive from the analysis. First, whatever the rate of tax, if there is to be a tax on development value, there must also be a positive element in the situation. I think that positive element is bound to be action by local authorities. That would be true of any rate of tax. Whether it is the Community Land Scheme or some other formula for local authority action, there must be some local authority action to make up for whatever effect a rate of tax may have on the supply of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, the Opposition are not in a position to deny the need for local authority action, and reference is frequently made to the £80 million which they provided for local authority acquisition of land for private development. I understand the point which hon. Gentlemen make when they say that there is a particular entrepreneurial action in finding certain types of land for development, and I understand that we need that sort of action to continue within the time scale of this legislation. Nevertheless, one can overdo local authority arguments about their incapacity to find land for private development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the moment, after all, taking total land for development the local authorities provide about 50 per cent. Admittedly, their contribution to land for private development has been very much smaller, though no doubt it was given some stimulus by the right hon. Gentlemen's £80 million.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that the local authorities can operate in this field, and we have provided in the Public Expenditure White Paper estimates of the sort of contribution they may be able to make.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
anybody disputes that local authorities can acquire land. They do it all the time. The hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) referred to the council housing programme in his city. The collection of land by local authority action through compulsory purchase is a slow and very expensive business, and of course the Land Act imposes another tier between the builder and the farmer by bringing the local authority in as well, and that adds delays and costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be, but nevertheless I think it remains true, and must be true, taking the argument that the right hon. Gentleman presented this morning, that if there is to be a tax on development value, one has to support it by the mechanism of local authority action, whatever defects that mechanism may suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The trouble with Lord Barber's proposals is, not merely that they are today a constant source of embarrassment to the Opposition, but that they did not contain any such positive element as we have provided within the Community Land Scheme. Lord Barber proposed what was, in effect, a very high rate of tax—75 per cent. on many acquisitions—and yet he did not add to it this essential further element of positive compensating action by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the first lesson I derive from this analysis. There must be action in some quarters by local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second lesson I derive is that to reduce the risk of a land shortage—I say the risk, not a certainty—it is necessary for a period, particularly while the local authorities are building up their capacity to act on their own, to have a lower tranche. That is why we now propose that there should be this lower tranche.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may comment, incidentally, that I believe that from the point of view of land supply development land tax is a very much better tax than development gains charge. Therefore, that is an argument for getting this bill legislated as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come specifically to the arguments which have been presented during the debate on land supply. The present position is such that there is certainly a low level of activity, but recently there has been some increase in that level of activity, judging by the number of transactions that have taken place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) referred to the number of trans-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
actions that have taken place, and he referred to the fact that in 1975 the level of transactions was about 30 per cent. of what it was at the high point in 1972 and 1973. That is true, though I note also, as he will have done, that although it is a very much lower figure than in 1969–70, it is a much higher proportion of those figures than of the figures of 1972–73.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure—this is another of the uncertainties involved—how far one can relate the number of transactions to the supply of land. One effect of the high prices in 1972–73 may have been that there were a number of transactions in respect of the same quantity of land by people engaging in speculative activity. One effect of the development gains charge may have been to eliminate certain types of speculative activity, thus reducing the number of transactions. Therefore, I do not think it right to argue that the fall in the number of transactions means a comparable fall in the coming of new land into the pipeline. In any case, the number of transactions is now rising. The probable explanation for this is that the supply of land has more to do with the economic situation, with the fall in land prices as compared with 1973–74, than with the tax situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the future, we have existing stocks, local authority activity on a growing scale, and the fact that the market will be helped by the 66⅔ per cent. tranche. As to the effect of the 66⅔ per cent. tranche, I am pleased to note that certain of our critics have made remarks which seem to support the Government's decision to introduce such a tranche, and they seem to think that it will have a favourable effect on the supply of land. Using moderately cautious language, I see that the journal of the RICS says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"this may be expected to give a modest boost to housebuilding among other things."</p></blockquote>
I do not at the moment expect words of greater encouragement. However, they are words of some encouragement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I notice that, before we took this decision, the Housebuilders' Federation, in making representations on the development land tax, suggested various alternative approaches to this matter. One of the alternatives was that the 80 per cent. rate should be reached only on gains of £100,000 and that there should be scales below that. Effectively, we have gone beyond what the Housebuilders' Federation said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder whether the right hon. Gentleman would allow me to interrupt at that point, because it might help the Committee a little. Has the right hon. Gentleman made any estimate of how many transactions will be involved in that tranche and how many will be over it? Will most of the transactions take place within that figure, or does that not cover a large part of the transactions likely to occur in a year?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My guess in terms of number of transactions is that it will cover the majority, although I have emphasised that this is an area of great uncertainty. I think also that the larger areas, where the development value is greater than the top of the tranche, is where local authorities will be most active.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely it is impossible to have more than the roughest guess, because it depends on the state of the economy over the next three years, and in particular on the rate of inflation. If the rate of inflation took off to a marked extent, plainly the figures expressed in money terms would not be very relevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. This illustrates exactly the point I was trying to make. There are great areas of uncertainty as to what factors have really produced what effect. We thought it right to introduce this tranche, not because we thought that there was a certainty of a shortage of land, but because we thought that there was a risk of it. We wanted to avoid that risk, because it was not worth taking.

A further question is whether landowners will wait for a political change. Perhaps they will. They will have noted from the debate that there is no clear line from the Conservative Party as to what it would do. The rate of tax proposed on Second Reading was 52 per cent. It is now 60 per cent. We have received no assurance during the debate as to the rate of tax the Opposition would think appropriate if they came into office. There has again been a conflict between the arguments—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Gentleman that the Opposition have also requested stability. On the one hand, we have requests for stability and, on the other, requests for absolute discretion. It is difficult to fit these together. All I am saying is that the Opposition's arguments provide no comfort at all for those who would wait for a change of Government before selling their land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition could give stability. They have accepted the need for additional tax. They could at least assert that, if they won a General Election, they would stick at the 66⅔ per cent. Unless the Opposition come further than they have towards our position, we can only conclude that their grudging conversion to a special tax on development value is not yet genuine. I ask my hon. Friends to reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Paymaster-General has answered a number of points in his own way, and we are glad to have the Government's views on the very powerful points which have been put forward by the Opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me start with the first point of principle which the Paymaster-General put before the Committee, that all development value belongs to the community. I believe I mentioned on Second Reading that there is the case where the neighbour has provided the value in his neighbour's land: by being restricted from development, the neighbouring land has increased in value. I do not see how one can say then that the increase in development value is due back to the community. However, one cannot judge in many cases how much the increase in value is due to the improvement of surrounding land by the community or how far it is due to the restriction on the neighbouring land from development. That is one reason why we should not have a punitive rate—I still use the phrase "a punitive and penal rate", as my hon. Friends have done—of 80 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Paymaster-General very frankly said that exactly what effect this will have is quite unknown. We on this side have sought professional advice. Professional advice has been given to the right hon. Gentleman. That advice is that, if the tax is higher than 60 per cent., it will cause a dry-up in land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend will probably recall that I specifically asked the Government to cite the authorities which
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
supported their rate. We have had no reply from the Paymaster-General.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very grateful to my hon. Friend—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) had an answer to this specific point. I referred to the scale of tax suggested by the Housebuilders' Federation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know if the Housebuilders' Federation considers that 66⅔ per cent. is the correct rate of tax. If that is so, I have not seen any document saying that is so. Grudgingly, perhaps, it has said that it was a good thing that a tranche was made lower than 80 per cent., but that does not give the right hon. Gentleman the right to say that the Housebuilders' Federation has in any way approved the 66⅔ per cent. I believe the Federation has said that that will be some help. Of course it is some help if any tax is reduced. No evidence whatever has been produced for having the tax at 80 per cent. The only evidence is that that figure will cause a very serious reduction in the supply of land. The right hon. Gentleman rather brushed aside the point that if the supply dries up the only alternative is compulsory purchase by the local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked the Opposition to provide stability. With the Bill before us, the only way the Opposition could provide stability would be to say that they agreed to the tax at 80 per cent. I can assure him that we are not going to do that. We have given some indication to the public of the intentions of the Opposition if they were returned to Government and that they would reduce the tax very considerably because of the professional advice given to them that the right rate of tax is about 60 per cent. or below. The advice is that, if one goes above 60 per cent., under present conditions, there is a serious risk of the supply of land drying up. The right hon. Gentleman has not satisfied me in his answers and perhaps my hon. Friends will wish to come back again on some of the points they made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As my right hon. Friend specifically mentioned the question of the Housebuilders' Federation, and as the Paymaster-General received advice on what was said—I referred to the matter at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>57</span>
column 21 of the proceedings at our last sitting—perhaps I should put on record what I understand the position to be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Federation expressed its views in a paper submitted to the Government in October of last year, a copy of which I have before me. There has, of course, been a considerable change in the market since then. It states.
	<br><blockquote><p>"We submit, therefore, that the proposed rate of tax is far too high…We have previously proposed that, in order to stimulate the supply of land, the rate of tax should be no more than 60 per cent. We also believe that the initial exemption of £5,000 is too low and is, in many cases, less than the exemption which would be available on gains within the first £10,000 of proceeds for DGT purposes."</p></blockquote>
That argument obviously appealed to the right hon. Gentleman because he has made a concession in that regard and increased the exemption to £10,000. The paper continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In order to stimulate the supply of land, we believe that suitable incentives must be given to landowners, and therefore we wish to put forward suggestions aimed at achieving that end. We do stress that we are not necessarily wedded to any particular one of these alternatives, but that we do urgently wish to see the introduction of a scheme which would provide similar incentives."</p></blockquote>
The Federation then put forward several suggestions, the third being the one I read at column 21 of HANSARD about a differential rate of tax going up to 80 per cent. for gains of over £100,000. That is what the right hon. Gentleman referred to this morning, as did the Minister for Planning and Local Government in Question Time last week, or the week before. Although the Federation put its proposal forward it was one of a number of alternatives to its basic suggestions,
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the rate of tax should be no more than 60 per cent."</p></blockquote>
Clearly, these must be said to be the fallback positions; the third line of trenches rather than the first—"trench" being an appropriate expression in these cases. There is truth on both sides of this argument, and it would be best to leave the matter at that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed with the right hon. Gentleman's remarks. I appreciate that the Government have made some concession in moving to 66⅔ per cent., which is welcome. The disadvantage is that it is only for three years. I also appreciate that the Department of the Environment will be unhappy with the land position. I mentioned a survey in 	<i>Building Week</i> which should be published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When speaking of the development gains
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
tax the right hon. Gentleman failed to tell us what the revenue from that tax had been, if any, so far. I have asked a number of Questions about that, but the answer has been that the revenue is either insignificant or it not known. I suspect that is because the tax is being levied when the land market is in a depressed state, partly because of the existence of that tax—which was Lord Barber's intention—but also because of the generally poor state of the housing market, with not much land coming forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Treasury is concerned about the rate of tax, we should be told what the revenue has so far been from development gains tax, how many assessments have been made, and the cost of administration in calculating those assessments. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give us this answer during the course of this debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to put another matter to the right hon. Gentleman, I hope he will be flexible about it, and view it with common sense, as I am sure he will. If the Government intend to insist on 80 per cent.—and I hope my hon. Friend will feel able to press the matter to a Division, unless the Paymaster-General comes back with a concession that he did not give earlier—I hope they will use the first couple of years of the experience of 66⅔ per cent. below £150,000 and 80 per cent. above that, to see how the thing is working out. If hard evidence can be produced—and I gave warnings from individual building companies in my speech last time, as to how they saw the position—that there is a serious drying-up of the supply of land, I hope the Government will not simply say "This is just speculation, and we must use the Community Land Act powers to take as much as we can." Because that would be expensive and slow and have a bad effect on the housing programme. If the Government remain in office for the remainder of the lifetime of this Parliament, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman, if he sees this happening in the next year or so, will be able to use the powers under the Finance Act to bring forward a lower rate. The one thing I am sure both sides of the Committee are determined to achieve is that, irrespective of our attitude towards profits from land, there should be a high level of private housing output. That seems to be the essential issue and, if we can agree on it, perhaps we can make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>59</span>
Gentleman has said that no one can be sure about effects of higher tax, and we must all accept this, as he agreed. But as no one can be sure, and as the Minister has been unable to produce any expert advice to support the Government's proposals for a rate of 80 per cent., one is unhappily driven to conclude that this rate has been chosen because the Government have to give a certain amount of attention to voices on their Left—who are actually remarkably un-represented in this Committee at present—and are prepared to gamble with the supply of housing because they pay attention to those who urge a punitive rate of tax. That, I think, is a major condemnation of this approach.

	<p>[Mr. John Roper 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be as brief as possible. Brevity is the soul of wit, and it is also the characteristic of good law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is bad law, because it has all the characteristics of bad law. It is incomprehensible to any lawyer. It is incomprehensible to any layman. It is abstruse, difficult, complicated and lengthy. It attempts to set out in statutory details what ought to be set out in simple principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The clause, which requires us to have a rate of tax of 80 per cent., was justified by the Paymaster-General in one of the most phenomenal arguments in bad logic that it has been my misfortune to hear. His argument was that the value of land when it is developed is created by the community, that therefore the profit, or increase in value,</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>60</span>
	<p>General had to say, because he gave no indication of accepting reality. Therefore, I support my right hon. and hon. Friends in pressing this matter to a Division.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed:</i> No. 4, in page 	<b>2,</b> line 	<b>5,</b> leave out '80' and insert '60'.—[	<i>Mr. Graham Page.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 8.</p>
	<p>should be returned to the community, and that there was not any entrepreneurial act which created the profit.</p>
	<p>That is an interesting philosophical basis upon which we should have taxation—that the more entrepreneurial acts there are, the lower the tax, and the greater the community value thereby created, the higher the tax. If the right hon. Gentleman is to write his memoirs like the Prime Minister, on that basis the rate of tax upon them, in that he is put into that office by the community, will be much higher than that on a private citizen who has got there in a private office on his own and has written a much better book which records lower sales.</p>
	<p>It is one of the most preposterous hypotheses for the basing of tax that I can conceive. In any event, it is false. I can imagine nothing less accurate than to suggest that the development of all land results in an increase in its value as a result of community activity and not entrepreneurial activity.</p>
	<p>Most development is done by entrepreneurial activity. We have mentioned Centre Point. If it were not for the entrepreneurial activity of Mr. Hyams, there would be no Centre Point. If we relied upon community activity, there would be no Centre Point. Indeed, most of the hideous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
landscape which is before us in the Committee would not be there either.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that my hon. and learned Friend was not making a personal remark in talking about the hideous landscape.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was taking a longer view than my hon. Friend, who requires spectacles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is utterly false to suggest that so-called windfall profits are the result of community activity. The Labour Party does not suggest that wins on such things as football pools or Premium Bonds, which the Government actually run, are entirely community profits. It is entirely the community which creates the Premium Bond winnings. Nothing that the entrepreneur does can affect them. If the argument has any validity why are they not to be taxed at 80 per cent.?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second matter which I find extremely disturbing—this is a very serious matter—a matter which I would have thought would have appealed to the consciences of hon. Members opposite—is that the Paymaster-General said, quite rightly, that we cannot calculate the effect of this rate of tax because recent economic circumstances have confused the matter. I would have thought that without the confusion of recent economic circumstances the effect was both calculable in effect and incalculable in degree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect that the tax will have, which is absolutely certain, is that it will increase to a very large extent the price of houses and the price of office accommodation. I know that that is nothing to the Department of the Environment, which is happy to pay £120,000 a year for a prime site in Aberdeen and £180,000 a year for a prime site plus penthouse in London, but it is a matter which affects the ordinary citizen, because the cost and the rate of taxation on pensioners and on their savings and minor earnings, is affected by the price of Government and it is affected by the price of offices that run their daily lives. The premium they pay on their insurance policy is affected by the price of offices and the amount they have to pay for their house, the amount that the moneylender has to pay for his office, all affect their standard of living.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been dismayed that the Committee has not heard any suggestion from the Paymaster-General as to the likely
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
effect of this tax in percentage on the price of housing to the ordinary citizen, because it is inevitable that it will be a very substantial increase in the price of housing. This is what I find so phenomenal about socialists: they are always talking about the need to keep down the cost of living, the need for the wage earner to have housing, the need to have more housing, and the need for people to be able to afford
good housing. But when they find somebody they detest like a developer, then they slay the people along with the developer. As long as they hammer the developer, the people can pay more for their cake: as long as one makes the baker squeak, it matters not whether the people have bread.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ioan Evans</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman talks about the effects on the house purchaser. What effect does he think it had on the price of houses when the price of land escalated as it did under the previous administration? When the price of land goes up by 200 per cent. or 300 per cent., does not that have an effect on the eventual price of the house which has to be charged by the house developer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course the price of land has an effect on the price of the house that is built on it. Land is part of the total of materials which have to be paid for to make the house, but the price of land plus the tax on the price of land puts it up even further. That is the point, and it seems to me disgraceful that the effects on the ordinary citizen of the country, the ordinary house owner, the ordinary family, both through the price of houses and through the price of offices, is not considered. As long as somebody who gets something for nothing—provided that he is not a supporter of the Labour Party such as a Premium Bond owner or a pools winner can be squeezed, it does not matter what happens to anybody else, it does not matter about the multitude who will have to bear the effects of this tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I congratulate you, Mr. Roper, on your elevation to the Chair.

I suppose I ought to reply to the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn), who thought it inappropriate to make his speech during the debate on the previous amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As to what is incomprehensible to lawyers, I confess I am unable to judge. I was once the sole lay member of a Com-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
mittee of lawyers considering the Criminal Justice Act, and I then found that there was a wide area of incomprehensibility on that Committee. However, I hope that, while the proceedings of this Committee continue, comprehensibility will become greater for all of us.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>[Mr. Alan Fitch 	<i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the right hon. Gentleman has admitted his ignorance of the law, does he intend to ensure the attendance of a Law Officer here? I see the Whip shaking his head. However, there will be cases when we shall be demanding the attention of a Law Officer on many points in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not confessing to any incomprehensibility in the Bill. I was merely referring to the hon. and learned Gentleman's suggestions in that regard. Whether we need the attention of the Law Officers we shall have to see as we proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman seems to have missed the simple point I was trying to argue. It is possible to distinguish between entrepreneurial activity and increases in development value. That is the basis of the Bill. That principle is accepted by the Opposition's acceptance of the need for a special tax. Whether the result is calculable in effect but incalculable in degree—leaving aside whether it is possible to understand the phrase; it may be just another incomprehensible legal phrase—the Opposition's suggestion of 60 per cent. has been admitted by them, if he was listening to his right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), as having an incalculable effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the essential reply was given by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdare (Mr. Evans) in his decisive intervention. Can the hon. and learned Gentleman imagine what the effect of a tax will be, even at 80 per cent., let alone 66⅔ per cent? Incidentally, I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that I have confirmed that the overwhelming majority of transactions take place within these limits. I think that he will find that that will be the experience. Does the hon. and learned Gentleman imagine that an increase in the weighted average price per hectare from £20,000 in 1970 to £61,000 in 1973, an increase of three times the amount, does not have a greater effect on the price of houses than a tax even of this kind? Does he im-
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
agine that there is no justification, when there are movements of price of that order, for the State saying "We will have a share in that increase in development value"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman must think a little more carefully about this matter. I leave aside for the moment the point that we are here having a tax of 66⅔ per cent. for a period of three years on what will, I believe, be the majority of transactions. The difference between 66⅔ per cent. and 60 per cent. should not give rise to the degree of eloquence which the hon. and learned Gentleman managed to achieve on this occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that I can allow the right hon. Gentleman's words to pass. He said that an overwhelming number of the transactions will take place within the £150,000 development value limit. It may be that an overwhelming number will take place if one is dealing, for example, with deemed disposals. There will undoubtedly be a great number of those. In volume of land being brought forward it is probable that the overwhelming volume of land disposal will be above that limit. One thinks of vast areas in the same ownership—and I ask the right hon. Gentleman to check this—in South Hampshire and around Bristol and Swindon. If they are to be brought forward for development—I know that is what the owners wish—I think in one year in those large areas it will go above that limit.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I confirm I was not speaking specifically of numbers of transactions.

Since then the Government have tabled Amendment No. 34 to do exactly the reverse of what we suggested. That does not matter, because all we were trying to draw attention to was the wording of subsection (1) which starts by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Immediately before a project of material development is begun on any land."</p></blockquote>
and is not consistent with the definition in Schedule 1(2)(1) which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the carrying out of a project of material development shall be taken to be begun".</p></blockquote>
We wanted to know why it was that in Schedule 1 it was
	<br><blockquote><p>"the carrying out of a project"</p></blockquote>
whereas in Clause 2 no such words are used. It does not seem to matter much whether my amendment or the right hon. Gentleman's is accepted, as long as we have one of the two to get the matter on all fours.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have taken advice since the amendments were tabled. Although it does not make all that much difference, the parliamentary draftsman advises that he would prefer Amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 36 which seek to amend the schedules rather than the clause. The hon. Gentleman has said that he does not mind which way it is done. If the Committee considers it wise, we would prefer the hon.

	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
amendments do that the Opposition's amendment would not do. What is the difference between the carrying out of a project and the project itself? The reason for my hon. Friend's amendment was that the carrying out of a project seems to cover all stages of it. If one merely says "a project", it may well be that one starts a project. But when one talks of "the carrying out" of a project—and even taking that to be after it has begun—it seems contradictory. What is the real difference between saying "a project" and "the carrying out of a project"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I want to thank the Minister for taking the point. It is a nice augury for the future that on the first of the minor amendments, if I may so call them, we find that we are to a great extent in agreement with the Government and I am sure that we shall move speedily through the Bill with the Government giving way on every amendment we have on the Notice Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that there is no difference between the two situations, except that there would be inconsistency in the Bill if the drafting in a clause were different from that of a schedule. We feel that the best way to deal with the matter is to amend the schedules, and I hope that the Committee will agree to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister advises me to withdraw my amendment so that his can be commended to the Committee, and I shall be pleased to do so. Before doing so, however, I should like to say that the Minister is a most distinguished tax counsel. He may remember that there was one occasion when the courts were going through a tax case which the draftsmen had put down and the learned judge remarked that if it were within the power of the courts to do so he would wish to charge the cost of the action to the draftsmen who had drafted the particular clause. The view of the draftsmen is not always infallible, but, nevertheless, I accept the Minister's offer, and accordingly I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 29, in page 	<b>2,</b> line 	<b>10,</b> after 'time' insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'less the incidental costs as defined in Part VI of Schedule 2 to the Act) attributable to the deemed disposal'.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
Subsection (1) gives a description of the deemed disposal. It provides that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Immediately before a project of material development is begun on any land, every major interest then subsisting in that land shall be deemed"—</p></blockquote>
I emphasise the word "deemed"—
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of this Act to be disposed of for a consideration".</p></blockquote>
If it is a deemed disposal I presume the consideration is also deemed. But, in subsection (1) the consideration is deemed to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"equal to its market value at that time and to be immediately re-acquired at that value."</p></blockquote>
If the disposal is to be deemed, I suggest that so, too, must the consideration. If we are considering a consideration for that deemed disposal, we must surely take into account the deemed expenditure on disposal—that is, the incidental costs of disposing of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, there is a definition later in the Bill of incidental costs. In Part VI of Schedule 2, on page 93 of the Bill, incidental costs are described, and paragraph 31(2) refers to the expenditure as—
	<br><blockquote><p>"Expenditure on fees, commission or remuneration paid for the professional services of any legal adviser, surveyor, valuer, auctioneer, accountant or agent, and any other costs of conveyance or transfer (including stamp duty)"</p></blockquote>
and it goes on to define such expenditure even more closely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one deems that property is disposed of at a certain date, I am suggesting in the amendment that one must also deem that certain expenses are incurred on the occasion of that disposal and that one should take into account as the consideration only the net consideration after deducting those expenses and not the gross consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may well be, and I hope it is the case, that the Minister will tell me that this is taken care of elsewhere in the Bill. We can deduct from the consideration on disposal the incidental costs and, therefore, we can deduct on deemed disposal the deemed incidental costs from the deemed consideration. I am sure that I have now tied the Paymaster-General into knots. I hope I have made the point and that the Minister will accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot go as far as the right Hon. Gentleman would wish me to go and allow a deemed deduction of deemed costs. May I put his mind at rest on one score? As the right hon. Gentleman has pointed out, the actual costs incurred in carrying out this deeming operation—I
	<span class='label label-info column'>68</span>
stress the word "actual"—will be deducted and tax will not be payable on that element of the cost.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman has pointed to the schedule and to the list of incidental costs, and in most cases involving a deemed disposal the valuation costs certainly would come into the matter. Any actual costs will be taken into account because the tax in the end is payable on the difference between whatever the base value might be—as Clause 4 points out—on the net proceeds of the disposal. Therefore, the actual costs incurred will be taken care of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is suggested that we should go further, and start deeming costs in all directions. Presumably, that means deeming the cost of a conveyance and other costs—solicitors' costs and accountants' fees which have not yet been incurred—and no limitation has been put on the deeming process. I suggest that to bring in hypothetical costs which have never been incurred is going too far. To that extent we cannot accept the amendment because we deal with actual costs and that is the proper and fair way to do it. Therefore, I ask the Committee not to accept this amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure it is my fault for not explaining the amendment fully, but I do not think the Minister has taken into account the unfairness between the person whose disposal is deemed and the person who actually disposes of property by sale. If he disposes by sale, he will no doubt have had a valuer to tell him what the value is; he may have had a surveyor; he will certainly have had a solicitor acting for him and at least at present, until solicitors are deprived of the right to put their well-trained services at the public's command and deprive them of conveyancing, there will be solicitors' conveyancing costs if the property is sold.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the sale is merely deemed, why not take into account against the deemed market value of that property the expenses of disposal? All we are trying to calculate here is an entirely fictitious figure, which is going to be used in future as a base figure, if I understand the position correctly. We are asked to consider the market value, and to assume that this property is disposed of, and that in future that will go on the record as the disposal figure for all calculations afterwards. We are asked to deem that the owner of the property disposes of it at market value without any expense. I should like to own property of which I could dis-
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
pose at market value without the expense of legal fees for conveyancing. But that is a quite fictitious position and we ought to take into account, in the market value, the fact that there will be expenses. I believe that those expenses should be taken into account against the consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the situation stands, it causes great unfairness between the person who has decided to carry out the development on his own land and the speculator who has bought a piece of land for the purpose of selling it and does not intend to carry out development himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to look at this matter again. The taking into account merely of actual costs on these occasions does not meet the case at all. There may be a surveyor's cost before the person concerned starts the deemed disposal, but there will not be all the same costs as when a person sells the property. Elsewhere in the Bill we are entitled to take into account those incidental costs against a sale price and they should be taken into account against a deemed sale price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understood the right hon. Gentleman perfectly well. He has made it clear again that he wishes certain costs which have never been incurred to be taken into account. As an example, he contrasted the position of the person who actually sells and the person who is deemed to sell, but the unfairness would occur under his proposal, whereby the person who sells gets the costs. The right hon. Gentleman would say that the person who is deemed to sell, but never incurs those costs, should also be given deemed costs. I suggest that that is the unfair situation—namely that someone who has incurred costs should be given some kind of deemed</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>costs. We cannot deem costs which never occur.</p>
	<p>When we come to the question of market value and valuation, it could be said that this is a fictitious figure. But it is not. It is the market valuation of the right to carry out that development. A figure can be put upon it, valuers will put a figure on it, and the costs of so doing will be allowable in deduction. But to deem a market value and then say that we must deem some fictitious costs with no limits to the deeming procedure is, if I may say so, imprecise, and unfair as between the actual vendor and the person operating the deeming procedure.</p>
	<p>We cannot therefore go along with the right hon. Gentleman. I cannot say that I shall consider it, because I do not think that that would be fair to the Committee. We cannot meet the right hon. Gentleman on this; the position on capital gains tax is exactly the same—we have a deemed disposal for capital gains tax purposes, we do not take deemed costs into account, and I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will find that this goes right through the tax code.</p>
	<p>I know that he does not agree with the deeming provisions in Clause 2, and I accept that he would argue against the whole deeming procedure. But once we have accepted Clause 2—and we will come later to further arguments about it—I do not think we should take the deeming procedure further to bring in wholly fictitious costs which have nothing to do with the actual operation, and upon which there will be no possibility of placing any limit.</p>
	<p>I am sorry to disappoint the right hon. Gentleman, but I cannot consider it because it does not make sense within the terms of the legislation.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 7, Noes 6.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 30, in page 	<b>2,</b> line 	<b>42,</b> at end insert:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>'or (	<i>c</i>) the market value on the date on which the project is begun does not exceed £20,000'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope, Mr. Fitch, that you will not regard it as a discourtesy to yourself or to the Committee if I rise to speak without my jacket. I do not wish to carry the intimate nature of the proceedings too far, but although I welcome, like the right hon. Gentleman, the move to this room, I wonder whether in future the temperature on arrival could be a little lower than it was today so that we may get off to a crisper start at future sittings of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two amendments are apparently related in practice, but I should first like to consider Amendment No. 30 because it embraces, to some extent, the effect of Amendment No. 5, whereas the converse is not the case. Separate considerations are also involved in the amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate on the Ways and Means Resolution the Paymaster-General said that the exemption from tax on the first band of a gain of £10,000 complemented measures for excepted development under the development land scheme. On Second Reading the right hon. Gentleman went on to say that the vast majority of owner-occupiers would be unaffected in transactions relating to their property under the proposed development land tax in view of the one-acre exemption. He went on to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any development value realised by an owner-occupier on the sale or development of his sole or main residence or of land up to one acre occupied with it as his garden or grounds is exempted from the tax.'</p></blockquote>
[OFFICIAL REPORT 15th March 1976; Vol. 907 c. 941.]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome that exemption and we think that it is a sensible improvement which will exclude not only a number of cases which are small financially but which affect owner-occupiers who are not in any ordinary way concerned with transactions in land of any size or value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of Amendment No. 30 is to secure that there should be further means of excluding some of the smaller items which would otherwise come within the scope of the tax. Provisions have been made in relation to the size of the gain in the £10,000 exemption. They have been made in relation to the area of domestic land involved in a transaction. We now propose that there should be a figure for market value exemption which would give a third means of excluding from the tax a number of other
	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
small items without having to go through the elaborate procedure of obtaining valuations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any absolute figure of this kind—like all absolutes in this huge and amorphous Bill—is open to honest differences of opinion. I feel sure that if the Government were to say that a figure of £19,500 was acceptable, instead of £20,000, we would not quibble. There should be some figure which would exclude individual deals where the market value is not high and which would save going through two notional valuations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We well understand that exemptions for the size of gain and for the area of domestic land are collective exemptions which would not be the case if an exemption was introduced relating to market value. There would also be the danger of an individual market value exemption leading to the splitting of land into smaller parcels with the specific intention of bringing below an exempted figure a large number of parts of a large piece of land. It would be perfectly acceptable for proposals in this direction to go beyond the strict wording of Amendment No. 30 to provide for this. Indeed, it could be included under Clause 13, although that relates to rates of tax affecting the whole of the development land tax. We felt it appropriate to bring forward an amendment here—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It has been drawn to my attention that there is not a quorum. The Committee may now proceed, as hon. Members have returned into the body of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

While I am on my feet I should like to seek your guidance and advice, Mr. Fitch. When the last Division was called, one of my colleagues who was standing by the telephone at the Sergeant-at-Arms' desk did not hear. I make no complaint about your call to form a quorum, but the babble and noise outside in the Committee corridor is of such volume that anyone who shouted would have grave difficulty in making himself heard above it. This is a matter which should be taken up with the appropriate authorities and I beg you to think about the circumstances of a quorum

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for drawing my attention to that fact. I shall certainly make representations to the right quarter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Fitch. I was much further along the corridor in that direction when the Division was called and I heard the call with great clarity above any babble.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no motion before the Committee at the moment as to whether any particular hon. Member heard the Division called.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was explaining that our reason for tabling an amendment to Clause 2 to this effect was that, although it may well be that at a later stage of the proceedings we should consider an exemption related to the market value of transactions, which would affect the whole of the development land tax, Clause 2 specifically relates to deemed disposals. In such cases the arguments for having a market value exemption are much stronger. It would greatly reduce the number of smaller cases involving double notional valuations—a valuation of market value and current use value on a deemed disposal. We believe it would alleviate the administrative burden connected with such valuations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that individuals are not likely to have several deals in one year which would aggregate to a higher total. But, even if they did, some provision could be included to deal with such cases. Any company in that position has a £10,000 limit which would exclude the whole, or the greater part of, any gain in a transaction with a market value below, say, £20,000. Above that, in view of the 66⅔ per cent. tranche and the level of corporation tax at 52 per cent., the difference in revenue which might occur in a few isolated cases would be very small indeed. Therefore, it would be a useful improvement to the administration which will flow from the enactment of the Bill if a market value exemption of this kind could be introduced, particularly in relation to deemed disposals. I commend this thought for the consideration of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Amendment No. 5. The first problem we have is that of determining the exact meaning of subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>). One needs to take a run at the text and omit some of the jargon on the way in order to understand the ultimate effect. Let us re-
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>
mind ourselves that we are dealing with deemed disposals. We are not dealing with market transactions. We are dealing with imaginary transactions which need two imaginary valuations before they can give rise to any charge to tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We see from subsection (2) that we are dealing with projects of material development. Having consulted Part I of Schedule 1, we may be nearer understanding what that means. Then the remarkable subsection (3) says that everything
	<br><blockquote><p>"comprised in a project of material development"</p></blockquote>
is a major interest in land, and therefore potentially gives rise to a charge to this tax, unless it is specifically excluded by paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following this logic we read that
	<br><blockquote><p>"an interest in land comprised in a project of material development is a major interest unless—"</p></blockquote>
It is to be noted that it is not "iff" but "unless". Here we start a trail of double or implied treble negatives which make the following clause difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point to make is that, unless everything is specifically excluded, it is a major interest for this purpose. It is a major interest unless
	<br><blockquote><p>"(	<i>b</i>) its market value on the date on which the project is begun is less than £5,000 and …"</p></blockquote>
Certain other conditions stipulated in sub-paragraphs (	<i>i</i>) and (	<i>ii</i>) apply. Converting this back to a positive sense, if the land is worth more than £5,000 and falls within those categories, it is still a major interest and comes within the scope of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (3)(	<i>b</i>)(	<i>i</i>) says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"if the land is in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, the interest does not confer, either absolutely or conditionally, and whether on that date or at any later time, a right to possession, as defined in Section 205(1)(	<i>xix</i>) of the Law of Property Act 1925."</p></blockquote>
That Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Possession' includes receipt of rents and profits or the right to receive the same, if any".</p></blockquote>
So we look up the definition of rents. Section 205(1)(	<i>xxiii</i>) of the Act says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'Rent' includes a rent service or a rentcharge, or other rent, toll, duty, royalty, or annual or periodical payment in money or money's worth, reserved or issuing out of or charged upon land, but does not include mortgage interest; 'rentcharge' includes a fee farm rent;"</p></blockquote>
I am sure that you Mr. Fitch, were aware of this before the Committee sat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot understand why the hon. Gentleman asked me earlier if the Law Officers would be present, as the hon. Gentleman himself is present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the implied compliment from the right hon. Gentleman. I state this really to explain how complicated the implications of this part of subsection (3) are to understand and how difficult it is to work out what is involved. Amendment No. 5 proposes that the whole area of uncertainty and definition should be removed, to the enormous benefit of the Government, local government officers, members of the Committee and everybody who will have to do with the Bill in the future, by narrowing the area which will be covered by all the technical provisions and legal definitions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We then go on to a Scottish bit. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford) is with us. Perhaps he knows more about 	<i>dominium utile</i> than I do. It was probably laid down and defined in the Act of Parliament held at Perth in 1396 or something like that—just before Sir Walter Scott wrote a novel about the "Fair Maid of Perth". Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can contribute on the technical problems there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What does it all mean? If we turn thankfully, and perhaps in a sense of exasperation and relief to page nine of the booklet of explanatory notes prepared by the Treasury, we read that the purpose of subsection (3) and (4) includes the following.
	<br><blockquote><p>"An interest in land which is not that of a freeholder or leaseholder, or their Scottish equivalents (eg an easement or the right to enforce a restrictive covenant) will also be excluded if its market value is less than £5,000."</p></blockquote>
This is more specific. We are talking about easements and the right to enforce restrictive covenants. The dictionary definition of "easement" is
	<br><blockquote><p>"a right or a privilege to enjoy something which is not your own".</p></blockquote>
I wonder in what sense chief rents would stand in relation to these definitions? I do not know much about chief rents. I believe that they are more common in the north of the country than in the south, but they do not appear to be covered by subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>) because they do not involve a reversion of property under a lease. Does it come under the definitions which I have recited? I do not know. Is it excluded altogether? If it is not under those definitions, it is automatically excluded and so it becomes a major interest. Yet if so and it is a major interest, it does not seem to be hitched in any way to the value of development and so would go completely against the spirit of subsection (3)(	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
I quote this as an example to show the appalling complexity we find ourselves in when we try to define what may be covered by the provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are left, I suppose, at least positively, with the interpretation which includes easements and restrictive covenants. There is also the danger that there is anything else which may have escaped the net. We must next face the problem that, whatever these easements and restrictive covenants may turn out to be, we must value them. How else are we to know whether they will have a market value of less than £5,000? We have to value them not only once but twice. We must find out not only what is their market value but their current use value as well. It is not as if either of these types of interest in property change hands on either occasion, otherwise they would not be included in Clause 2 at all under "deemed disposals".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So what on earth will the district valuer do? Will he check comparable cases to see what the market in current use values for easements and rights of restrictive covenants are? I expect Mr. Fitch, with your long experience, that you have an up-to-date knowledge of the current use market value of easements which are hiding away in the alleys of Wigan. Not all of us are so privileged, and I do not expect that many district valuers possess such skill and knowledge as I am sure that you have. Each easement and each right of restrictive covenant is, by definition, unique. It relates to one piece of property and gives a benefit to one other party, so that the district valuer cannot use the other refuge in times of distress, which is that of residual value. He cannot work back to a value of easements or rights of enforcing restrictive covenants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What, then, is the current use value of either of the types of interest? If it is not to be currently used, how can it have a current use value? If not sold, how can it have a market value? Will there be some circular of instructions to district valuers giving them guidance as to how to deal with these ticklish problems? Will they be told to take out their ladders and theodolites and measure angles of light and easements of access in order to decide what the valuations may be? Perhaps the Minister is proposing to introduce a new schedule with an algebraic formula of such eccentricity that my hon. Friend and Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) would enjoy discussing it on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>77</span>
It is manifest nonsense. How can betterment be contemplated in any form unless there is some form of increase in value which can be reasonably accurately assessed and which can be activated by a development? What happens if a development occurs adjacent to a property which enjoys one of these easements or rights to restrictive covenants? Let us suppose that the easement of light is a modest improvement and one gets a little more sunshine, or gets it half and hour earlier in the day. If that is a 5 per cent. improvement, is there to be a 5 per cent. improvement in value as the means of deciding the differences between current use and the new market value upgraded by the development gain of some extraneous development?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There could be a restrictive covenant on access. If, instead of having a household with five people next door, one ends up with a school with 500 pupils, will the right of restriction of access be 100 times as valuable because it refers to 500 people instead of five before? If the easement is not infringed or the restrictive covenant is not enforced at the time of material development, it all remains in the future anyway. How will one put a hypothetical value at some time in the future—an unknown number of years ahead—and discount it to some notional value today? To describe such an interest as major in relation to a project of material development seems to me to make a mockery of the English language. To attempt to value it in any way is patently ridiculous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that the limit will be abused. To remove the words in lines 30 and 31 would not give rise to any wicked profiteering. It would not even give rise to any wicked deemed profiteering. There is no point in trying to ease the position by putting a higher figure. There should not be a figure there at all. I hope that, if they were to accept Amendment No. 5, they would at least remove some of the uncertainty and a great deal of the nonsense which the Bill still contains.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister of State made a fine slashing monetary speech in winding up the debate. In the course of that speech he said, rightly, that he could not forecast what the yield of the tax would be, because he said that that depended on the state of the economy and the land market in the next few years. As I made clear in earlier debates, I accept that proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I have looked through the Minister of State's speech with some care this morning, and I cannot find any statement of the cost of administration of this legislation. I may be wrong about that, and since he does not rise to tell us where it is in his Second Reading speech, perhaps he would tell us now. It is something that we ought to know when we are dealing with the complexities of matters such as a deemed disposal biting upon interests which are not freeholds or leaseholds. It may be that we shall find that the administration costs of this legislation are enormous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must underline that the administration costs are borne, not just by the taxpayer generally through the vast cost of increasing the bureaucracy, but also borne by the individual taxpayer or person who believes that he may be eligible for such a tax. It is only right that we should know at the start what the overall cost of administration will be. Perhaps when we have heard it and been suitably appalled by it, the Ministers involved with this tax, who have demonstrated—I do not wish to undermine their position in their party in any way by saying this—how reasonable and open-minded they are, will give a bit more leeway on these small amendments in the hope of trying to reduce the administrative cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"Better to have no laws at all than to have them in such abundance and complexity."</p></blockquote>
That might well be said of modern legislation in this troubled land. I have often come to the conclusion that all the parliamentary
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>79</span>
draftsmen were killed in Word War 2 and a new breed, who knew not how to speak the language which previously pertained, have come into office without any instruction from their late colleagues. [	<i>Interruption,</i>] "Learned" I may be, but one of the principles of the law is that it should be simple.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, the clause is complicated, and the Minister will be able to demonstrate to the Committee that, wise and all-seeing though he claimed to be when I last made the point, he has not the first idea of what he is asking us to pass means. In order to ensure that the Committee is not passing into the law of Scotland, something which all members of the Committee would not intend, I will ask him one or two questions, the answers to which he will no doubt have immediately at his fingertips.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, in the Explanatory Notes it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"An interest in land which is not that of a freeholder or leaseholder, or their Scottish equivalents".</p></blockquote>
What are the Scottish equivalents of a freeholder or leaseholder? I do not know. Secondly, are the parentheses which state
	<br><blockquote><p>"eg an easement or the right to enforce a restrictive covenant"</p></blockquote>
intended to qualify
	<br><blockquote><p>"or their Scottish equivalents (eg an easement or the right to enforce a restrictive covenant)",</p></blockquote>
intended to cover the English, Irish and Scottish equivalents, or intended to cover only the English equivalents?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term
	<br><blockquote><p>"easement or the right to enforce a restrictive covenant".</p></blockquote>
is unknown in the law of Scotland and utterly meaningless in the circumstances. I should like to know what the Scottish equivalents are. I do not understand the term of art
	<br><blockquote><p>"easement or the right to enforce a restrictive covenant'.</p></blockquote>
I should also like to ask the Paymaster-General this. The interest under subsection 3(	<i>b</i>)(	<i>ii</i>)
	<br><blockquote><p>"is not the estate or interest of the proprietor of the 	<i>dominium utile".</i></p></blockquote>
What is the 	<i>dominium utile?</i> Who does he understand the proprietor of 	<i>dominium utile</i> to be or will include? What does
	<br><blockquote><p>"or, in the case of property other than feudal property"</p></blockquote>
mean? What is feudal property? What is not feudal property? Does it include burgage property? As the Paymaster-
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
General will appreciate, I am the proprietor of burgage property, and he will know what it is and, therefore, will be able to tell me if I am exempted under the term "other than feudal property". I am anxious to discover that for my own interest, which I declare as an owner of burgage property, and I am sure the Paymaster-General will know what that is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I also ask if a positive servitude is excluded or included; and would a negative servitude be included or excluded? These are matters which would be difficult to value but which are absolutely essential rights over property in Scotland, and are not necessarily the property of the proprietor of the 	<i>dominium utile.</i> If the Paymaster-General would be good enough to answer those questions, so that the clause can mean something to a Scottish lawyer—it is not intended to mean anything to an Englishman, because the law of Scotland does not apply down here, though it was obviously drafted by an Englishman because the explanatory notes explain it in terms which are unknown to the law of Scotland—it would give some indication of whether we are passing into law, as has become the habit of Parliament and all parties, utterly meaningless complicated legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are so anxious to get down to every minutiae that we complicate the principle. It is infinitely better that justice should be rough and the law should be general rather than particular than that the law should be so complicated as to be meaningless and its application so expensive as to be unable to be afforded, either by the unfortunate taxpayer who has to pay for this administration or the unfortunate citizen who has to bow under this unnecessarily complex system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will leave the points on Scottish law to my right hon. Friend the Paymaster-General, since the hon. and learned Gentleman specifically asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise to the hon. and learned Gentleman. I shall deal with some of the points related to the amendment, but first may I say this? Of course the legislation is complicated; the hon. and learned gentleman asked for rough justice and simple legislation. It is complicated because we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
are operating within the normal areas of ownership of land. Some of my hon. Friends might think that this is a fault in the Bill, and that we should go much further and be much more radical in our approach and not operate within these feudal limitations of the law of property. But hon. Members opposite might be very upset if we introduced, say, a two-clause Bill that did away with these difficulties in relation to the law of property and introduced a certain rough justice, which apparently the hon. and learned Member wishes to introduce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason the Bill is complicated is that we have decided to operate within the areas of property law which go back to feudal times. By so doing we have disappointed some of our hon. Friends, but I expect they will go along with it as an attempt, at least, to remedy some of these problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before doing so, perhaps I should deal with costs of administration, because this point was raised. The cost of administering this tax would not really be any different from those for administering the Opposition's special tax. They want a special tax on land—they did not at one time, but now they are committed to a special tax on land. I do not think they would want a tax which did away with all the different forms of ownership of land; they would not wish to abolish easements, freehold, rights of way, and all the other interests in land. I expect they would accept all that and would not want complete nationalisation of land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Opposition do not want all that, and want a special tax, their special tax must operate within the same confines of our property legislation as our special tax. Indeed, the only difference between us now is on the rate of the tax; we are all converted to a special tax on land. So these costs could not possibly be any different from theirs, because they also are concerned about these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The total cost of operating this tax would be about £4 million a year. That includes the cost of the DLT office which we are setting up, and also the costs of valuation, which might be over and above the specific costs of the office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Relating that to the general costs of collection of taxes, about which I have made some inquiries, I understand that for taxes on income, profits and capital gains
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
the cost of collection is 1.74 per cent. of the total amount of revenue raised. So taking together capital gains tax, income tax and profits tax, because they are all calculated as one part by the local inspector, including, of course, the development gains charge introduced by the hon. Members opposite, the totality of costs is 1.74 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we think about estate duty and death duties, capital transfer tax—the Opposition were in favour of the old estate duty, because they kept it in operation for a long time—the cost of death duties is 2.37 per cent. and the cost of operating this tax amounts to 2 per cent. So the cost of collecting this tax is slightly above that of income, corporation and capital gains tax, but slightly below the cost of death duties. If one wants a special tax, as the Opposition do—they are wholeheartedly converted to a special tax—their special tax would have to cost a little more than the total income, corporation and profits taxes. So these costs are not out of line with the general costs of collection of taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to deduce from that most helpful information, for which I am sure we are all grateful, that the expected immediate annual yield from this tax is £200 million, despite the fact that the returns from the development gains tax that it replaces were negligible, to use the words of the Paymaster-General's advisers? This seems a rather remarkable transition. The hon. Gentleman referred to 2 per cent. as being the cost of collection and said that the cost of collection was £4 million. Mathematics is not my strong point, but £200 million is the figure I would deduce as the yield.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not mean to suggest that at all. Obviously it takes some time for the yield to build up. If, in the early years of any tax, one relates the cost of collection to the yield from the tax, those costs are high, but then they flatten off as income comes in and as assessments are sent out. In the first few years the figure might exceed the 2 per cent., but when the tax is operating in relation to the yield we expect from it, that is the kind of percentage cost we expect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to the development gains charge, and said that no money has come in. Some is gradually coming in, but that was introduced only in 1974, and presumably it related
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
to the 1974–75 year of assessment, although I am not quite sure, because it was the Opposition's tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now it is the hon. Gentleman's tax!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am referring now to the tax that the hon. Gentleman's party introduced—the development gains charge. That was introduced in relation to the 1974–75 assessment period—retrospectively, I seem to remember. This was the tax that apparently, with hindsight, the Opposition do not approve of, and which they introduced retrospectively—government by question and answer.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain why it is that, on Second Reading and at all stages since up to this moment, he has said that it really was not sensible to try to forecast a yield from this tax, but is now trying to give a figure based on the anticipated yield? That is thoroughly illogical. Surely the only fair figure to put forward is the cost of collection, not the proportionate cost of collection in relation to the anticipated yield. The Minister did not answer my question. I wanted not only the cost, but also the number of people employed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. I said that it is very difficult to estimate the total yield from any tax on land, and it may take some time for that yield to build up. This does not mean that we cannot try and make our estimates and we have tried to make the best estimates we can of the yield that will arise from this tax in four or five years' time, as the tax builds up. But we cannot be certain of that, and it would not be right for me to tell the Committee that there was any absolute certainty about this—neither could the hon. Gentleman give a yield from his special tax. We are trying to give the figures. We know that the costs of collection will be about £4 million and, with the anticipated yield, that will mean about 2 per cent. cost of collection. We cannot go any further than that. I think that we are being honest with the Committee in giving them the figures on which we base our assessments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is nothing sinister about this at all, and we have made it quite clear what the tax will cost, the Opposition should tell us how many people they would need to operate their special tax. I would suggest to them that it could hardly be any different if they are serious in their conversion. I still have doubts about this, but we shall see as the Committee progresses. But if they are serious about their conversion, I suggest that their tax would probably take about 200 to 300 people to operate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman elaborate upon a point he made when he said that the cost would be £4 million.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure I gave relates both to the DLT office and all other valuations, certainly by central Government.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0613">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
know, but I should think that the figure of £4 million does not include specific local government valuations in purchases of land.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am again asked "How many people?" I think if the hon. Gentleman reads my Second Reading speech he will see how many people. I think that I have dealt with that point. I now turn to the amendments, and I shall deal first with Amendment No. 30.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman explained his amendment very clearly to the Committee, and we are very grateful to him. He said that the effect of his amendment would be to give a £20,000 exemption in relation to any major interests. We can argue about the definition of major interests, but if the major interest was worth less than £20,000, under the amendment no DLT would be payable at all. No DLT would be payable on the commencement of material development, and if there was an exemption of £20,000 in relation to any of those interests on the commencement of material development, that exemption would be carried over into a disposal—an actual disposal—of those interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, if you had a leasehold interest which was a major interest worth less than £20,000, under the amendment no tax would be payable at all at the commencement of material development As I understand it, valuation of that interest would then go into the value of current use value, and later on face value. It would mean, in effect, an exemption in relation to ultimate disposal as well. The amendment does not only refer to the commencement of material development, although I accept entirely that he had that as his main point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot accept that amendment because it adds the extra amount of exemption. We have introduced the £10,000 exemption by which anybody who disposes of land, either through a deemed disposal or through an actual disposal, in a year of assessment receives £10,000. He cannot receive more. If he embarks on a number of transactions, he still gets £10,000 and no more in a year of assessment. We thought that this was the right figure. It excludes small transactions and, in the circumstances, we think that it is fair. We do not believe that we can go further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In effect, the hon. Gentleman's suggestion would take us up to £30,000 because,
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
if a man had used his £10,000 slice, which he is given in the Bill plus the £20,000, which has been suggested, then we should have a complete exemption of £30,000 which we think is going too far. Also, it would lead to all sorts of difficulties and problems with people splitting up developments, obtaining the £20,000 in relation to one part of the development and £20,000 for another, or splitting the development between companies with each company getting the £20,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was mentioned that we might have to introduce legislation to prevent that. If we introduced dozens of clauses on anti-avoidance, there would be splendid speeches from hon. Member's opposite saying how complicated the tax was. If we were to introduce an exemption of this kind, it would mean a greater exemption than we think is desirable or right. It would also mean very complicated anti-avoidance procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the figure of £10,000 is fair. The original suggestion was £5,000. We consulted the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors and other bodies and, as a result of the consultations, we raised the basic slice exemption figure to £10,000. We could not go further towards what the hon. Gentleman wants as this would raise the figure by a further £20,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Amendment No. 5, which is more technical and deals with rights of possession. The hon. Gentleman quoted from the Law of Property Act 1925—an Act with which we are all very conversant. Even the Scottish lawyers, I believe, know something of the Law of Property Act 1925.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That Act does not apply to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall come to the law of property in Scotland later. I think the hon. Member made a little too much of the Act. The concept of a right to possession is a very clear and well-known concept in English—I accept not in Scottish—law. We are concerned here mostly with restrictive covenants and rights of way. There may be wayleaves and various other rights but, in the main, when we talk about a right which does not confer a right to possession, we talk about a restrictive covenant and a right of way. A restrictive covenant can be extremely valuable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member asked what kind of developments would confer benefits on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>
these minor rights. A restrictive covenant need not necessarily be a minor right. It could be a very substantial right. That is why we have confined the exemption to, for example, a restrictive covenant worth less than £5,000. If it is worth more than £5,000 we think that it is a valuable right and should come into the legislation of right of way. It could be very valuable in relation to a development of building land. We do not see why owners of these very valuable rights—common, ordinary rights—should be allowed any exemption over and above what is in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) had his way he would remove all that. A restrictive covenant worth £100,000 or more would be completely exempt. He said that he did not think we could go up from £5,000 and that there should not be a limit. By implication, whatever the value of the restrictive covenant or a right of way, it would be outside the operation of this legislation. That, again, I do not think is right and could not be accepted, as they are very valuable rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us suppose there are mineral rights under a house. They have no value while the house is there because they are unobtainable, but they have a prospective value if the house is knocked down. The person who sells the land sells it with a house on it. How are the mineral rights to be valued for the purposes of this clause—as if the house was not to be knocked down or as if it was?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has answered his own question. He said that while the house was there the mineral rights have no value. I suspect that all these matters would be taken into account in valuing the house and valuing the mineral rights. No doubt there are peole who can work out the valuation in such a case. It would be a "hope" valuation. There would be the possibility of knocking down the house and getting the mineral rights. These are problems of valuation. I do not imagine that the process of valuation in Scotland is any different from valuation in England and Wales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to accept the amendments, we should be allowing a considerable latitude in the legislation benefiting people with rights which are not rights of possession but which could be very valuable rights, such as restrictive covenants and rights of way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>
The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West did not want us to go further than £5,000. I turn to the clause itself and point out what the Government are trying to do. We are saying that a major interest in land which is of value should come into this kind of legislation because we cannot exclude valuable rights of this kind. For that reason, I ask the Committee to reject the two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of the law of Scotland, I was disappointed that the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn), a well-known Scots lawyer, confined himself to the Explanatory Notes. That is all right for laymen, but we lawyers would prefer to look at the actual text. If one were to look at the text one would see that the parliamentary draftsman, with the assistance of his Scottish colleague, has provided for the law of Scotland. In subsection (	<i>b</i>)(	<i>ii</i>) the hallowed words 	<i>"dominium utile"</i> are written. I believe that comes from Justinian originally, or even Gaius, so it is not confined to the law of Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the draftsman has taken care of the law of Scotland. No doubt the Scots judges know very well what interests in land are—for the benefit of the law of Scotland. Knowing as I do the ability of Scots judges, I am sure that they will be able to decide such matters with clarity and skill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman answer the questions I asked? I asked not with regard to the Explanatory Note. I asked why terms of art which mean nothing in the law of Scotland are used to qualify a mere Explanatory Note, or the Scottish equivalent. I asked what the Scottish equivalents are. What does the
	<br><blockquote><p>"interest of the proprietor of the 	<i>dominium utile"</i></p></blockquote>
mean? I should like to know to whom that is meant to refer. This is the Government's Bill and they should know. They should not rely on Scots judges. I want the hon. Gentleman to tell us what it means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Or, in the case of property other than feudal property, I want to know what feudal property is meant to refer to. Does it include burgage property? What property in Scotland does the hon. Gentleman imagine is non-feudal property? I want also to know whether servitudes, positive or negative, are included.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to the final question is that they are included if they are worth more than £5,000. There is no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>89</span>
question that these servitudes will be taxed under the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards 	<i>dominium utile,</i> I refer the hon. Gentleman to the Finance Act 1974 following on Lord Barber's famous proposal introduced retrospectively by a White Paper. This makes it clear that "freehold" means the estate or interest of the proprietor of 	<i>dominium utile</i> or, in the case of property other than feudal property, of the owner. These are terms which are clear to Scots lawyers and I am surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman is not aware of their meaning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister know?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tried to raise the question of the implications for public service manpower. I was told that it was set out in the Minister of State's speech. I tried to cajole him into being more informative by saying that it was a good speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reasons for referring to it are these. The Minister talks only of the 200 or 300 people who will be in the palace at Middlesbrough. The king and the courtiers at Middlesbrough will be concerned only with the raising of the tax. They will not be concerned with the valuations. The district valuer's office in each instance will be concerned with the valuations. It is because there have been such frequent changes in this area of taxation—I wish that the Minister of State would listen to this for a moment. His Government introduced the Finance Act 1974. It has his Government that decided the development gains tax was the right tax to use in this area, and his Government have now changed their minds and introduced development land tax. It is his Government that will cause many new people to be employed in district valuers' offices. I think that the Minister ought not just to talk about the courtiers in the palace in Middlesbrough.

I deal first with Amendment No. 30. The Minister complained that, if he accepted Amendment No. 30, it would mean that possibly major interests in land either passing on sale, or being deemed to be passed by the development being started, might be exempted up to £30,000. We shall come to the £10,000 exemption of development value later on. We are here discussing a 	<i>de minimis</i> on the major interest. We could disregard property which is of a value not exceeding £20,000, and this administratively will ease the imposition and collection of the tax. It is also a very fair exemption which has been recognised in taxation law for a very long time when dealing with land, that smaller transactions should be exampt. So we have put a very simple exemption of £30,000, and that refers, not to the development value, but to the market value of the property itself at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that, as the amendment is drawn, it might apply to all disposals and not only to deemed disposals. I am not quite sure how that would be, because we are dealing with a subsection which itself deals entirely with the calculation of the ascertainment of the major interest in land when it is part and parcel of a deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was hoping that, as the Minister complained that this amendment would extend to all disposals and not merely to deemed disposals, he would be prepared to accept it as being applicable to deemed disposals. It is this aspect that is of importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's complaint was that, if we exempted property of a value not exceeding £20,000, there would be a splitting-up of land between companies and between individuals so that it would be developed only in small parcels. But surely that applies just as much to the £10,000 development value exemption that we have from the Government later in the Bill. It applies just as much to the £150,000 reduction in rates from 80 per cent. to 66⅔ per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area that we have to consider in the case of exemptions is just the same as the area which we have to consider in the case of a material project. This is the point where the splitting-up can be attacked, if the Government wish to attack it, in the material project of the land to which that material project applies.

	<span class='label label-info column'>91</span>
First, I say that the splitting-up argument is bad because it applies equally to our amendment as to Government exemptions and tranches later on. Secondly, it can be dealt with on the extent of the material project—the project of material development. I urge the Minister to think again about the 	<i>de minimis</i> provision here. The Opposition are not wedded to £20,000, which the right hon. Gentleman tells us will leave too much of a gap in the £200 million tax which he hopes to collect. I am sure we are prepared to consider a figure of £10,000 or £15,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important, as is recognised in the clause, that one should have 	<i>de minimis</i> figures in these matters. Already a limit of £5,000 has been put on the value of easements, restrictive covenants, and so on. There is already an area at the bottom of the scale exempt from tax. We ask that that exemption should be applied, not only to easements, but right across the board on the value of the property which is deemed to be disposed of under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to what is to be included as a major or minor interest. My hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) explained the purport of the clause, although it is not easy to understand with its treble negatives. I urge the Minister to ask the draftsmen to look again at this so that it can be clarified. The implication of paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is that if these rights were not mentioned in sub-paragraphs (	<i>i</i>) and (	<i>ii</i>) they would be major interest and would attract tax when development started upon the property. How one digs a trench in a right of light I am not quite sure. But how does one start a project of material development in respect of these rights?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, let me see what is included as a major interest. We must disregard the £5,000 limit because these rights will be exempted from the definition of the major interest only if they come within two parts of the definition in paragraph (	<i>b</i>)—first, that they are not worth more than £5,000 and, secondly, that they come within the conditions set out in sub-paragraphs (	<i>i</i>) and (	<i>ii</i>). My hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin mentioned one particular interest with which I am concerned in my constituency in the North-West. Probably only two other places in the country were considered, somewhere in Wales and at Islington in London, where chief rents have always been very popular. Chief rents give the person entitled to the rent no leasehold in-
	<span class='label label-info column'>92</span>
terest in the land; it is only a charge for the property. But is is an interest in the land. If the chief rents are not paid, there is usually a right of entry, the right to take possession for non-payment. There is a right of possession there, either absolute or conditional—conditional upon non-payment of the chief rent. I do not know whether that is a material interest in land under this definition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I gather that a major interest in land will apply if there is a right of light, a right of way, a right of support. But there are several other rights over land which are of value to someone who is not then in possession of the land. What about the rights of a controlled or regulated tenant? That is a very real right. What about the crofter's interest, in Scotland? I am sorry that I do not have the ability to turn to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) to get some advice on the crofter's interests in Scotland. They are matters of permanent interest in the land but not the whole of the interest in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about interests like combined drainage, restrictive covenants, and so on? I ask because if the person in possession of the land decides to develop it, as I understand it, every right over that land is deemed to be disposed of at that point. Let us suppose that the owner of land gives notice that he is going to start developing it and will carry out one of the specified operations mentioned in Schedule 1—that he will dig a trench that is to contain part of the foundations of a building. Then anyone who has a right of light over that property will be accused, shall I say, of deeming to dispose of that right of light because someone is digging a trench on the property. Anyone who has the benefit of a restrictive covenant over the property will have a major interest in the property and, because it has started to be developed, his right, whatever it may be, to enforce that restrictive covenant has to be valued, and he will be charged development land tax on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that is quite right if, for example, such a person owns fishing rights or shooting rights over the property, which may have some real value. But, if paragraph (	<i>b</i>) covers all such rights, it reduces the position to a farce.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that exactly the same would have happened if the Opposition had imposed such a tax on land. But that would not be so if we had adopted a far simpler practice than the deemed disposal set out in

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the right hon. Gentleman saying that, under his legislation, he would also tax restrictive covenants, fishing rights, and so on, on an actual disposal? His only reservation is that we are contemplating taxing them on a deemed disposal. If he says he would tax them on an actual disposal, he has exactly the same problems of valuation—of deciding which to tax, which not to tax and 	<i>de minimis</i> problems—as we have here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I disagree with the Minister. There is not that difficulty with valuation of rights where one is actually disposing of the right. The consideration is then passing, and one can allot that consideration to the rights passing as well. But, with deemed disposal, none of the rights is passing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not so difficult, I know, when it is a deemed disposal of a piece of land. One can get the market value of that land. Therefore, it is said that the market value is the consideration for that deemed disposal and on that basis tax is charged. But how, when someone starts to develop a green
	<span class='label label-info column'>94</span>
field in respect of which there happen to be some restrictive covenants or fishing rights—we shall come to the reversionary rights, because the same argument applies to those—why should the owner of those rights, when he is getting nothing out of that development at that time, have those rights valued and be told that there is so much development value in his restrictive covenant, right of light, right of support, right of combined drainage, or whatever it may be, and that he must pay tax on that? It has nothing to do with him. The owner of that land has decided to develop it, and thereby affected those rights over the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This modest, almost technical amendment has surprisingly given rise to a most important subject which has not emerged before: the amount of tax which the Government expect to collect and the cost of that collection. The order in which the Minister gave his figures was interesting. He started by saying that the tax will cost—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
