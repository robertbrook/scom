	<div class='title'>OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE INTERESTS IN LAND ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 111, in page 11, line 7, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The base value applicable on the grant of an option shall be the proportion of the relevant base value which the consideration for the grant of the option bears to the sum of the consideration for the grant of the option and the consideration for the exercise of this option'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 155, in page 11, line 7, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(2) The development value realised by the grant of an option shall not exceed the development value that would have been realised on a disposal at the time of the grant of the option of the interest in land in respect of which the option was granted for a consideration equal to the aggregate of—
	<ol>
	<li>the consideration, if any, given for the grant of the option; and</li>
	<li>the price payable for the interest in pursuance of the option.'</li>
</ol></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would first be appropriate for me, Mr. Crawshaw, to again welcome you to our deliberations. It is nice to see you back in the Chair as we resume our arduous work after the recess.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Clause 8 we are dealing with the extremely complex issue of options. May I say a word first about Amendment
	<span class='label label-info column'>590</span>
No. 111? It is not clear from the Bill exactly how the value of the option is to be calculated for the purposes of development land tax. I assume that in practice it is supposed to be the actual sum—that is, if builder A enters into an arrangement with vendor B that he will have the right to buy his land subject to, say, gaining consent in three years' time, and if he pays him £500 for that right, any DLT would theoretically be calculated on the full £500. In practice, of course, no tax would be payable in such circumstances, and even if it were it would be merged with the main disposal under subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In practice, options very rarely even approach £10,000 or, indeed, anywhere near it—certainly not in the case of housebuilding, although I am less familiar with the situation in commercial development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that we have a case where an option payment of over £10,000 has been made, and tax is therefore assessed. Under the clause as drafted, the grant of an option has no base value and the whole would therefore be liable to DLT. In Amendment No. 111 we try to rectify this problem by defining a base value for the purpose of the taxation of options, and the definition is as set out in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that the drafting is complicated, but I do not think that it is any more complicated than the drafting of Clause 8(1), which after several attempts I still find extremely difficult to understand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to Amendment No. 155. The receipt of option moneys does not necessarily reflect the realisation of development value. An option may be to purchase land at current use value. For example, it may merely give the grantee first refusal of a house in a pleasant residential area. It may be that a builder sees a house in a pleasant residential area which he gets an option to buy at current use value, either because he wants to live there or, possibly, because he sees the possibility of development in the garden in 20 years' time. Accordingly, the tax payable in respect of an option should not exceed the inherent unrealised development value, if any, in the land. Amendment No. 155 which my right learned and hon. Friends and I have tabled seeks to achieve this by limiting the tax on the option to the tax that would have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0888">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>591</span>
have been payable had the land actually been sold for the total consideration that will have been paid if the option is recognised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I apologise to the Minister of State and to the Committee for the complication of these matters. However, we are dealing in complictaed waters and I do not think that anything that I have said is necessarily any more complicated than what the Minister has said on occasion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) need not apologise for any complication which might have appeared from his moving the amendment. Perhaps I can apologise to the Committee for getting options wrong in another debate some time ago. This was incidental to something else that we were talking about. I think I might have said that an option was not an interest in land for the purposes of development land tax. What I meant to say was that the disposal of an option is not a part disposal of the land for the purpose of this legislation. The disposal of an option is taken as the disposal of a new interest, albeit an interest in land. I have never really understood whether options are interests in land for general legal purposes, but that is by the way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could correct the impression I gave that, in fact, the disposal of an option was not a disposal of an interest in land. It is a disposal of an interest in land but of a separate interest and not a part disposal of a totality of the interest, albeit a freehold. My error does not affect legislation, but I apologise to the Committee for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister has been good enough to explain something about options which, no doubt, has baffled others too, may I ask him to explain another point? He said that an option is a new interest in land, presumably while it remains an option. Does it become consumed in the interest in land from which it originally sprang, as it were, once the option is exercised? Does it then cease to be an interest in land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer to that is "Yes", and this is how the legislation is drafted. I shall come to that point in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>592</span>
Once there is a grant of an option, that is treated as the creation of a new interest in land. As the legislation is drafted, where that option, or, indeed, where the total purchase price for the land in respect of which the option is granted, includes development value, the money received for that option is taxable. The actual money received for the option is chargeable to DLT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As an example of the development land tax case and development value case, let us consider a situation where someone acquires an option to buy an acre of land and the price of the option is, say, £100 and the price of the acre of land, if he exercises the option, is £19,900. Let us suppose that the right hon. Gentleman gets an option to buy a plot of land; he pays £100 for the option and, if he wants to buy the land, he must pay another £19,900 for one acre. I am assuming here that that £19,900 plus the £100—that is, £20,000—would reflect development value. In other words, he is buying land which has substantial development value. In such a situation where the ultimate purchase, if it takes place, would be reflecting development value, the £100 option is chargeable to development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that it would not be taxed at that time and, although the Bill provides that it could be taxed at that point, in practice it will not be, because, as happens for capital gains tax purposes, the Revenue will wait to see whether the purchase goes through, as it would in most cases, when the whole lot would be taxed as one amalgam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in theory, and in practice sometimes, the £100 is chargeable to DLT and there is no base value to set against it, which is what one of the amendments seeks to do. There is no base value to set against it, because the Bill and the capital gains tax legislation are drafted in such a way as to assume that, when an option is granted, something new is created and the cost of creating that something new is nothing. There is no cost for creating that option; it merely means a man saying "For £100 I will grant you an option to buy this land." Therefore, we contend—this is how the clause is drawn up—that in reality there is no base value for that option. It is something plucked out of the air almost, and sold for £100 in my example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0889">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>593</span>
In that instance, in theory tax would be chargeable immediately on the £100, subject to the assessment machinery, and the balance of the tax would be payable on the £19,900. But, at the end of the day, of course, it would just be tax on £20,000 and the base values would be taken into account—bases A, B and C—in calculating the tax on the £19,900. Therefore, no more tax would be paid. In effect, tax is paid on a kind of instalment basis if it is charged on the grant of the option. The amount of tax payable on £100, if tax were paid, is taken into account in the total final reckoning when we consider the tax payable on the extra £19,900. So tax is payable ultimately on £20,000, as it would be, anyway, if there was no option and if the land was sold for £20,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take another situation where there is no development value in the land, as in the simple case of an option fur £100 to acquire an acre of land for £400, so that the total cost of buying that acre would be £500. Let us assume that there is no development value: the figures have been pitched in that way to reflect the lack of development value. There would then be no charge on the grant of the options because the option does not relate to the purchase of land which has any development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here only with options to buy land when the purchase price at the end of the day reflects development value. That is the only case where the option is taken into consideration in coming to an assessment of tax under this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have clarified the matter. We are concerned, not with options to buy land at current use value, but only with options to buy land at development value. In theory, the option is chargeable and at the end of the day the balance of the price is chargeable, but the total tax will remain the same in either case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister has not finally sat down because I want to ask a question on that point. The tenor of the learned Gentleman's remarks was that in practice the Revenue would wait until the option was exercised and then deal with the whole transaction at that point. That would presumably apply even where there might be a substantial sum paid for the option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>594</span>
Let us suppse that there was a very large development area for which perhaps the ultimate purchase price was £1 million and the option for a transaction of that scale might be for £20,000, involving heavy legal costs. I understood the hon. Gentleman to imply that even in such a case the actual charge to tax would not be raised until the end of the day when the development value was known.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that in most circumstances that would be the case. I do not think that the size of the option would matter. The position is the same fpr capital gains tax and I understand that in practice the Revenue does not charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exception might be where the option is for £20,000 or £100,000 and the land is bought for £100. There are circumstances where people might try to shift values from the actual purchase consideration into the option. If that situation existed, I am not saying that the Inland Revenue would not then feel that it was an artificial transaction and seek to assess tax on the option. However, that would be an unusual transaction and not the kind of transaction that builders would enter into.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there were a completely unreal balance of value between the option and the purchase price, there might be an artificial avoidance situation. But, my advice is that in the normal type of case the Revenue waits. How long the Revenue would wait is another matter. Generally these cases go through fairly quickly and the Revenue would wait until the transaction was finalised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerning the amendments, I cannot accept an apportionment of the base value in which part relates to the option and part to the purchase consideration. It would complicate the matter to have an apportionment. Secondly, there are cases where the option is abandoned. If the option is abandoned, the grantor of the option would receive his £100. Under the amendment he would still receive his apportioned base value. I suppose that we could deal with that situation on a later sale of the land by deducting that apportioned base value from the base value he would receive if he sold the land later, otherwise it would be unfair: he would be receiving an uncovenanted benefit. However, that would make it even more complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0890">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>595</span>
Although all these matters are to some extent artificial because options do not fit very nicely into the scheme of things, in practice this is probably the best way of dealing with the matter, given the assurance that we are concerned only with development value. In most cases no charge will be made at the point of the option. There will be no more tax to be paid at the end of the day because of these provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think it is the under-statement of the week by the Minister that options will not fit nicely into the scheme of things. That is certainly so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are grateful to the Minister for explaining what he intends should be the law, but it is certainly not set out in this clause. I would have wished that, when he was going through that logical and sensible explanation of how to deal with options, he had been able to point to the phrases in the clause to which this amendment is tabled showing how it would work out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why not merely say that the money paid for the option merges into the estate which is being transferred and the interest of which is being disposed of eventually? I presume that it is to be left to a practice statement that the kind godfairy, the Inland Revenue, will not pursue the person who has received the option for some period of time. We do not know what period of time it will be. I presume that the statement will be issued—it will be a Press statement, or perhaps as an extra-statutory notice stuck up in a corridor of the Inland Revenue's offices—but it leaves the person chargeable with a Sword of Damocles hanging over his head for a tax on the option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can see logically that, if there has been payment for the privilege of eventually purchasing property, and if the purchase goes off, the owner of that property has made a sum of money—I do not see how it can be called "development value," but apparently it is in the Bill—which is to he taxed. It is nothing whatever to do with development value and it has nothing to do with the Bill. It is a windfall because one happens to own property, but it is no development
	<span class='label label-info column'>596</span>
value of the property to receive an option which is never exercised. It is the same with the forfeiture of a deposit. I agree that the person is lucky when he is able to forfeit a deposit or take an option without its being exercised. But this is not development value in the land; and to call it development value which is chargeable to tax does not fit in very nicely with the scheme of things.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If one said that this, then, is part of the purchase money when the purchase is completed, I could understand it; then the clause could be greatly simplified. We have tried to simplify it in these amendments. We have tried to find a base for saying that this is development value and chargeable to tax, but if the Minister wants the clause to carry out what he has explained is his intention the whole matter needs looking at again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not taken a great deal of interest in this clause before, but as I listended to the arguments I reflected on the way in which money values change so rapidly, and how it will be possible for the Revenue to decide whether there was in prospect a development gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to give an example from my experience in these matters. I live near the valley of the Trent where over recent years there has been a great deal of speculation in land for gravel extraction. When that was first realised to be a possibility, gravel companies bought options on large areas of agricultural land. They bought the options on the basis that they would in the future, pay a total price appropriate to the value land which had planning permission for gravel extraction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, by the time the options were on the verge of running out the price of agricultural land had risen to a money value which was equivalent to land capable of being used for gravel extraction and which had planning permission for this purpose. So the gravel companies exercised their option in spite of having no planning permission for extracting the gravel. They exercised their option in the belief that the land, as agricultural land without any developmenr value, was still a good buy and could, if need be, be sold on at a profit as land without any planning permission and without necessarily even any hope of development gains. It seems to me that it will impose
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0891">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>597</span>
a tremendous problem upon the Revenue, if we are approaching a period when money values are going to be even more unstable than they have been over the past 10 or 20 years, to see what is a development gain in the circumstances of people buying an option.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can return to some remarks made by the right hon. Gentleman and at least take issue with him on one or two points. I said that options did not fit in nicely, and I meant what I said. They do not fit nicely into the general legal framework, not just for this legislation, but in law in general. They are different from most other rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked why the Bill does not set out the fact that the two are added together in the end. I point out that subsection (3) makes it as clear as is possible in legislation that the option and the final price are merged together or, in other words, the two interests are merged together. I submit that subsection (3) is clear. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purposes of this Act as a single transaction taking place at the time the option is exercised "</p></blockquote>
On that point, therefore, at least, I take issue with the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the other point regarding an administrative concession or an extra-statutory concession. The hon. Gentleman asked why we are not told that the Revenue will not collect the tax. This is an administrative matter, in the sense that it is better for everybody concerned, and clearer, that the Revenue should not seek to get the tax at the point of the grant of the option. There is nothing to stop the person who receives the option money from paying the tax if he wants to. There is no case of the sword of Damocles here. He knows that he will have to pay the tax, but he knows, too, that he is not going to pay the tax until he sells the land. If he is afraid of this sword of Damocles over his head, he can get rid of it by paying the tax. It is not a case of not knowing whether he will have to pay the tax. If the option is exercised, he will have to pay the tax when he gets the purchase money. If the option is abandoned, he will pay the tax when the option is abandoned, because he has got a gain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concede one point to the hon. Gentleman. The only difficulty might be in
	<span class='label label-info column'>598</span>
some cases, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, when we do not really know whether the option reflects development value. I concede that point absolutely. There may be some cases—that kind of case may be one—where it is not clear whether the option reflects development value, but again, in that kind of case the Revenue obviously would also be unclear as to whether the option reflected development value. That shows the wisdom of waiting to see the transaction going through.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, the Revenue may feel that it does reflect development and raise an assessment. That might happen in some cases. The taxpayer can then defend himself and say that it does not. I can see that in some cases there might be difficulty. But in the vast majority of cases these difficulties would not arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I think in practice, although I accept that options are difficult to deal with, there are also problems about shifting values from the value of the land into the value of the option, and the Revenue must have the opportunity to assess options in such cases. They are not the normal builder kind of case, but some people might seek to move values around into options, and to split them up in some way, and the Revenue has to have power to assess the option for that reason. That is why the clause may be somewhat complicated, but the basis of the clause is fairly clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, no more tax is paid than the totality of the tax, taking into account the option and the total purchase price.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister of State for the two replies which he has given, both to myself and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen). I am reasonably happy, in fact almost entirely happy, with the answer given by the Minister on Amendment No. 111, to which I was not entirely wed in any case. As the RICS itself says in the brief which it provided—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We foresee difficulties in applying to options the base values in Clause 5, as it may not be clear in all cases whether there is any development value."</p></blockquote>
That is a fair point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I am not happy with the answer given by the Minister on Amendment No. 155, on the question whether

there could be options relating to current use value. On this aspect the RICS says—
	<br><blockquote><p>"We point out that options are sometimes granted for the purchase of land at current use value as well as for purchase at development value… There is therefore a risk that options for purchases at current use value will attract DLT, which would clearly be inequitable."</p></blockquote>
The Minister said, very fairly, that in practice this would probably not happen, because the payment of the tax would be deferred until such time as any development value accrued. If development value did not accrue, there would be no payment of tax on the option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter in the light of our debate and, to see where there is a need to clarify the wording. Clearly it is not the Bill's intention that there should be DLT on an option which relates only to current use value. An amendment on Report might put the matter clear beyond doubt. I leave that thought in the Minister's mind and, on the basis of his assurance, I shall not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 130, in page 11, line 24, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'and, if no development land tax is chargeable on the disposal, shall be repaid in whole or in part accordingly'.</p></blockquote>
In the light of the previous discussions, and in particular the Minister's assurances about the point of collection of any notional tax on options, I shall be brief, because the Minister largely covered the subject in his previous answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under subsection (3) we deal with the situation when a builder actually exercises his option. The price which he paid for it is lumped in with the price, or deemed value, of the actual transaction of development value, whether it be the sale of the land by a builder or the start of a development under a deemed disposal. The two things are then taken as happening at the same time as the main transaction and any development land tax paid when the option was granted is taken into account against any DLT due on the main transaction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the amendment is to provide that, if it transpires that DLT is not, after all, due at the final stage—
	<span class='label label-info column'>600</span>
the value of land may have fallen below that of its base value, which is possible, or below that of the £10,000 exemption slice—the DLT which may already have been payable on the option shall be repaid to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of State may say that the person has probably not already paid the tax and, therefore, that the amendment is unnecessary. But let us consider the avoidance aspect mentioned by the Minister. That was a fair point. He said that clearly there must be anti-avoidance provisions, otherwise the Revenue might find the vendor of land telling the builder that the price of the option was £10,000 and that of the land £1,000, in order to avoid tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that such a transaction took place and the Revenue rightly assessed it at option stage by saying that it was not a transaction at arm's length, that it was not a fair transaction. The Revenue might claim that the price for the option was unreasonable, saving 50 per cent. of the value of the land and therefore the person would be assessed. Tax was then paid, but for various reasons the developer was unable to proceed with the development, or planning permission was revoked or lapsed or, as I said earlier, the value of the land fell below that of the base value. The local authority might suddenly decide to build a pig farm next door to the land so that it would no longer be possible to carry out the development. In those circumstances, when tax has already been paid on the option, I submit that Amendment No. 130 would be pertinent. I suggest that there should be powers in the Bill to cover those circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that I can reassure the hon. Gentleman that in that event no more tax would be payable than would have had to be paid, anyway. In the kind of case mentioned by the hon. Member and myself, if tax was chargeable at the option stage, less tax might be payable finally, and there would be a repayment of tax. I should like to quote the words in page 11, line 23, namely, "on account of". The payment is treated as being made "on account of".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, it may seem that that does not carry the assumption of repayment of tax is a smaller liability exists at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0893">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>601</span>
the final stage. I refer right hon. and hon. Gentlemen to Schedule 8, paragraph 55(2) which deals with the mechanics of collection, where I suggest that the wording puts the matter beyond doubt—
	<br><blockquote><p>"If any amount paid on account of any development land tax for which a person is liable as is mentioned…above exceeds the amount for which that person is assessed as being also liable, the excess shall be repaid to him."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, "on account" does not mean just a payment of a smaller sum on account of a larger sum. It means that if one has paid more than one should have paid the overpayment is repaid. I hope that gives the hon. Gentleman the assurance which he seeks in the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is absolutely right. I apologise to the Committee for not having the encyclopaedic memory of the Bill which my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has and for not remembering that particular subparagraph. The only thing I can pray in aid is that we are here dealing with page 11 and the Minister's reference was on page 165.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

The purpose of our amendment would be to delete the words on page 12
	<br><blockquote><p>"as if that deposit or other money were consideration given for the grant of an option to acquire that interest."</p></blockquote>
The logic of treating a forfeited deposit as option money, which is what the Bill as drafted does, is not immediately apparent to me. I would have thought that it was of an entirely different nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the logic of taxing option money where the option is not exercised
	<span class='label label-info column'>602</span>
is doubtful, at least the grant of an option will in many cases imply the existence fo development value in the land. This is not the case with a forfeited deposit. This will in many cases merely represent financial difficulties of the prospective purchaser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To illustrate the effect of treating a forfeited deposit as an option let us suppose that I sell my house for its current use value of, say, £20,000 taking a deposit of £2,000 and the purchaser does not complete. The £2,000 will be liable to DLT—as the CUV of a forfeited deposit is presumably nil—even though there is no question of development value in the land and even if the house is my principal private residence. Under Clause 8(1) the forfeited deposit is treated as a separate asset from my house and would not, therefore, attract Clause 14 exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a note circulated by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors it is stated that the present wording of Clause 8
	<br><blockquote><p>"could be a deterrent to the granting of options and the acceptance of deposits."</p></blockquote>
The remarks which I have made are considered ones—I hope that we all make considered remarks to the Committee. If they are in any way correct, they obviously represent a serious matter. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to look at this matter, even if he feels that he would not want to comment fully on what I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) was quite right. I accept that Amendment No. 156 is the paving amendment to Amendment No. 157. He queries whether an abandoned option ought to be equated with a forfeited deposit. This is the kernel of the argument. This is the essential part of this part of the clause as well as the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Bill, as drafted, an abandoned option is treated in the same way as a forfeited deposit. There are two reasons for this. The first is the way in which it rests on previous legislation. Among the things which pleases me very much is that we see the development land tax in many particulars rests on the development gains charge, which in itself in many particulars rests on the capital gains tax. On a number of general principles the two sides of the Committee are arriving
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0894">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>603</span>
at some degree of movement towards each others' positions. This pleases me greatly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in line with that the provisions here follow those of the development gains charge which, in itself, was based on the capital gains tax and this, obviously, would produce the consequence that we have here, that the forfeited deposit is treated as being equivalent to the abandoned option.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not rest it on that alone. There is the other point—I take note of the example given by the hon. Gentleman—that nowadays the forfeiture of a deposit is rather less of an occurrence than it used to be. There are, not only changing values in land, but also the changing way in which people make deposits. Normally or in many cases, a deposit is more an earnest of good intention and good faith than the actual deposit that the depositor expects to forfeit through a failure to complete, for whatever purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In so far as the Bill seeks and, I believe, should follow on what is normal practice, it is right to act in this way. But even if it were so—of course this is what we must consider—we have the second main argument—that of anti-avoidance, which, of course, is the foundation for so much of the legislation in the previous Acts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not beyond the ingenuity of people concerned in these matters to arrange for a number of such deposits to be handed over during a considerable period, and such deposits may be forfeited because of a breach of one or other of the various conditions that could be laid down. At the end of it all, when a large amount of money had passed hands in this way, the land could subsequently be passed over for a relatively small amount.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These matters obviously exercised the minds of the previous Government and of the Government before them. Since it rests on the previous legislation, it is wholly right that these provisions should continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A number of problems rise from this. We are grateful to the Minister for his explanation, but if this clause is to apply without the amendment there is doubt as to when the tax bites.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the option, we were told that the grant of the option and, therefore, the payment of money at that stage, is the point
	<span class='label label-info column'>604</span>
at which the option money becomes chargeable to tax, even though there may not be an assessment at that time and the tax may not be collected. Yet that is the point at which it is taxable. The forfeited deposit does not become taxable until it is forfeited, so there is that difference. There are many problems regarding deposits and, as many of us know, in practice the deposit is paid to a stake holder when one purchases property. At what stage then is the deposit paid? Is it a deposit at all when it is not paid over to the prospective vendor?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Then, comparing paragraph (	<i>a</i>) with paragraph (	<i>b</i>), paragraph (	<i>b</i>) deals with
	<br><blockquote><p>"other money paid by way of consideration for a prospective purchase."</p></blockquote>
That is all right; it is when the money is paid, rather like the option. But the last few words of paragraph (	<i>b</i>) are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…of an interest in land which is abandoned."</p></blockquote>
So it looks rather the same as the forfeited deposit; if the payment here is made for a prospective purchase and the purchase is then abandoned, it is at that point that the money becomes chargeable to tax—the point at which the prospective purchase is abandoned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true to say that we are copying previous legislation. This principle here that follows the development gains tax is not altogether satisfactory, because that legislation merely followed capital gains tax, which is not the same sort of tax at all. Although my party put this into operation, I do not think that the legislation is at all good in applying capital gains tax principles to development gains tax. I do not see why we should not try to tidy things up a little now that we are creating development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore call attention to those points. If this subsection remains, I think that there will be difficulty about its administration. I commend the amendments moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) and I should like to see them adopted to dispose of all the problems about forfeited deposit and
	<br><blockquote><p>"money paid by way of consideration…of an interest…which is abandoned."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman asked when the tax bites. He rightly pointed out that the option money is chargeable to tax. He further pointed out that the forfeited deposit is chargeable when it is so forfeited. This put the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0895">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>605</span>
position absolutely correctly. The forfeited deposit will be chargeable to tax at the time of forfeiture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman apologised for development gains tax. I assure him that there is no need for such apology. This coming together of the different viewpoints and on some of the principles involved has been very helpful and has characterised much of this Committee's work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the question of forfeiture of deposit, the right hon. Gentleman did not really deal with the way in which these matters have changed. With his long experience, I should have thought him better placed than almost anybody in the Committee to draw the distinction between the way in which these matters used to operate and how they operate now in times of fluctuating values in land. With the levels of inflation that we have seen, the role of the deposit over the years has changed considerably and it is only right that the legislation should reflect that change in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman pointed out the distinction between paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). He fails to see the kind of distinction that I, at any rate, can detect. I note that paragraph (	<i>a</i>) is concerned with the forfeited deposit and that paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is concerned with
	<br><blockquote><p>"other money paid by way of consideration"</p></blockquote>
and this is obviously a sweep-up provision to cover other contingencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned—and I am vrey aware of the force of his arguments, at least in this respect—possible difficulties in administration of various aspects as situations change and as people's responses to situations change. But I remind the Committee that we are here dealing with a tax measure and one of the things we are well used to, Mr. Crawshaw, as you will know, is coming together every year to discuss Finance Bill matters; and if there were any need for improvement in certain particulars, then, of course, this could always be part of the annual provisions that are brought forward to improve taxation not only in land but in other matters, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With that explanation, perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will decide not to recommend that the amendment be pressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not at all happy about this. I tackled it in my first point in asking the Minister questions on the
	<span class='label label-info column'>606</span>
basis of the amendments and was merely probing to see what was intended by this clause. Of course the amendments would remove from the tax provisions the forfeited deposit and the instalments of purchase money when the purchase is abandoned. They would deal with those by relieving them from tax altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot see why this should not be so. No development value passes when a deposit is forfeited. No development value passes when the prospective purchaser, having paid some instalments, abandons his intention to purchase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is intended to tax the development value in land when there is a disposal. In certain cases there is a deemed disposal, but only when someone starts to develop the land. There is neither a disposal here in the case of forfeited deposits or instalments abandoned, nor can there be any development from which one could deem a disposal. They are, if I may use an unparliamentary word, bastards in this legislation. They are not true sons of the ideas of principle of development land tax. There are something thrown in because somebody thinks "This fellow has been lucky in being able to forfeit a deposit or in being able to take instalments on an abandoned purchase, so let us have a swingeing tax on him because he has been lucky in that windfall".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the tax throughout is meant to be a tax on windfall gains, but not on windfalls of this sort which do not arise from the disposal of property and cannot be made from a deemed disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Treasury will receive enough tax out of transactions of disposal and development without chasing after deposits of this sort. These are quite distinct from the option. The option is something which one can distinguish from the forfeited deposit and the abandoned instalments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I think this is a reasonable amendment which my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has so ably moved, and we might press our views to a Division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take up the point which the right hon. Gentleman makes with some justification? I understand the force of his argument that this does not fall in the mainstream of profits

	<span class='label label-info column'>607</span>
of development. I fully understand and accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One could say that windfall gains, even of this kind, should be taxed because they are gains that are made through profits on land. However, I would not put that as the main point that I wish to pursue. The fundamental argument rests on the follow-through of previous legislation. If like the right hon. Gentleman, one is not satisfied with that, I must push the second point—namely, the anti-avoidance measures which, in their turn, were the foundation for the previous legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that one could have a situation involving deposits of that kind, which are not as common as they used to he, but which nevertheless could be used to a much greater extent, so that a person who owns land could receive a number of deposits, each of which became forfeited as a result of non-compliance with the conditions of</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave the clause, may I say that I hope that the Treasury and the Revenue will pay very close attention to the working of these provisions when the Bill becomes law. The option is a very important part of the development process. Indeed, it is an increasingly important part. I hope that we shall never again see the sort of land prices we saw in 1971–72, although I think that we probably will—and very quickly under the land Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One thing that happened during the big land boom was that people wanting to grant options, the land vendors, became increasingly greedy, and whereas in the past developers paid the sort of the sums we have been speaking of this morning—the Minister gave an example</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>608</span>
	<p>the deposit, with substantial sums of money having been paid for that land. On the eventual sale of the land, the consideration could be relatively a very small amount. That is the final stand I think on which one must base legislation of this kind.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has not convinced me. He certainly gave courteous and full answers, but I am not entirely happy with their content. During the cultural revolution in China, I believe that slogans on the wall said something like "Chairman Mao's heart beats as one with the hearts of the revolutionary masses". My heart always beats as one with my right hon. Friend, and I agree with him that we should press the amendment to a division.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 8, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>of £100 and I gave one of £500—it became not uncommon for land vendors to ask for 2 per cent. of the value of the land with planning permission, and that sort of thing, which, of course, is an altogether different sort of consideration in considering land running into millions of pounds. Just as vendors in the big land boom wanted all their money at once rather than in the staged payments, which we have tended to accept in the past as being the normal procedure in the developers' market, so that they also wanted very large options to keep them sweet until such time as planning permission was obtained.</p>
	<p>If that situation were ever to return the procedures regarding the taxation of options will become all the more important. It may not seem so attractive to the Revenue to defer payment along the lines which the Minister of State outlined earlier if very large payments seem to be made for options, as happened a couple of years ago.</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0897">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>609</span>
	<p>I accept that the Revenue requires proper anti-avoidance provisions. Nobody would dispute that. But I ask the Minister to ensure that in the operations legislation the Revenue, in so far as it has discretion, realises the essential part played by the option in the land market and in bringing land forward for development, and that nothing in the provisions of Clause 8 is made to operate to its detriment, because it would have a very serious effect on the land market.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to put two questions to the Minister of State, and also make one or two more general comments about the remarks made by the Financial Secretary who, unfortunately, has now left the room.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two points for the Minister of State are these. First, I understood him to say, in the context of a discussion on one of these amendments, that the money received for a lapsed option might be determined as being chargeable to development land tax in the light of subsequent circumstances. Perhaps the owner of land grants an option to another party to acquire that land, and receives consideration for granting the option. The option is not then exercised by that party, but on a subsequent occasion development value is realised either by selling it to a third party or by a deemed disposal on development by the original owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the arrangements for working backwards to the lapsed option and the circumstances of the time in which it was granted? I may have completely misunderstood the Minister of State on this, but I think it is an important point. How long ahead in the future, and in what circumstances, may there be some remotely contingent possibility of an assessment to development land tax on a lapsed option which has been triggered off by subsequent events relating, not to the option itself, but to land in which the option is granted? Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would clarify that point for my benefit and, perhaps, for the benefit of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point relates to Clause 8(4), which in the rather simpler language of the Explanatory Notes says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the interest in land acquired following the exercise of the option is later disposed of"—</p></blockquote>
then
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the purpose of determining the cost of acquisition and for any stock-in-trade or charity exemption"</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>610</span>
these will be covered in Clauses 16 and 23 when we get to them—
	<br><blockquote><p>"the option and the interest are treated as separate interests for…determining those exemptions."</p></blockquote>
I would like to have the Minister's comments on the reason for this, because I think it is something which we should cover for the record while we are dealing with this clause. I shall not try to make any of my own comments until the Minister, himself, has spoken upon it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I do not think that the Financial Secretary's remarks about the value of basing this tax on the precedents of development gains tax and capital gains tax can be allowed to pass in exactly the way in which he made them, because the development land tax embodies a separate principle from capital gains tax. It involves certain important features which distinguish it from development gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two most important differences between development land tax and development gains tax are, first, that it applies to companies as well as to individuals. Secondly, the rates of tax, although there are certain concessions in the early years, are due to be very high—80 per cent. is the starting rate for substantial transactions. Outside the context of our discussions in this Committee we have been led to believe that the intention is that there shall eventually be a rate of tax of 100 per cent. so that the development land tax can be brought into a sort of compulsory artificial market in land under the community land scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If rates of tax are to differ so much from the rates of tax which are chargeable under capital gains tax and development gains tax, it will behove us to look very carefully at what we are bringing into the scope of this new tax. A company is different; it has to pay corporation tax at 52 per cent., or whatever it may subsequently be, with all the offsettable expenses against that in the normal course of a company's trading and business activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very different in the case of a tax which is due eventually to be charged at 100 per cent., which will apply to companies, whose peripheral expenses may not be allowable as an offset against income they may have received from, for example, an option. If no value is attributed to an option and a company has already used its £10,000 exemption in a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0898">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>611</span>
year, after 1979, if we arc unsuccessful in amending that date, the basic rate will be at least 80 per cent. on such a charge and, in due course, perhaps 90 per cent. or 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are, of course, attendant costs attaching to the granting of an option, something which, perhaps, will operate more between companies than in the past. Perhaps options were often offered by development companies to individuals, but they form a very natural part of commercial behaviour in relation to land and development. It seems that it will not be attractive to grant options, if they have a nil base value—at least not for any consideration—and companies may have to think of other ways of charging the grantee of the option all sorts of items for expenditure and their costs in preparing them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are real difficulties and differences about having a tax at a much higher rate, and when it applies to companies which may not, in respect of any particular transaction, be able to use their £10,000 exemption as it has already been used up in their other business. So, although it is sensible to try to harmonise exemptions and various standard rules between capital gains tax, development gains tax and the new development land tax, we must recognise that we are now planning to legislate for different circumstances at rates much higher than have applied for companies under those previous forms of taxation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I think that the Financial Secretary's remarks, although there is some truth in them, should not be allowed to obscure the Committee's view of the way in which the development land tax will operate, the very high rates at which it will be charged, and, therefore, our responsibility in considering the details of this Bill, to see that nothing is brought within the scope of this tax which is not specifically value arising from prospects or actual development of land.

The remarks made by my right hon. and hon. Friends during our debate on the amendments carry weight. It is very dangerous to bring into charge this tax now. There are certain lower rates which may operate in some cases, or there is a superficial resemblance between this tax and capital gains tax or development gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>612</span>
Therefore, we should be very wary about extending that principle too far. This is a tax of a different scale in its rates from capital gains tax and development gains tax and it applies to companies as well as individuals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could deal with the three or four points raised by the hon. Gentleman, who asked us to pay attention to any problems that might arise. I take his point entirely. Much of the legislation relating to options is taken basically from the capital gains tax legislation. For us, in practice, there is not the same problem in relation to capital gains tax as there might be in relation to a tax on options relating to people in business who are builders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The capital gains tax situation may be smaller, in that there may be fewer options to deal with. But we are moving into an area where, as the hon. Gentleman said, it is customary for builders to buy land through the mechanism of an option. We will keep an eye on this to ensure that these provisions do not inhibit general commercial transactions. We do not believe that this will be so, but, as I said, I take his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the learned Gentleman's point also that this is not the same as the capital gains tax legislation, although there are similarities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point made by the hon. Gentleman concerned what would happen in the case of a lapsed option. He then went on to ask what would be the position if an option were sold to somebody else. I am not sure if I followed him correctly, but if an option lapses—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was concerned with a case where, in relation to the same piece of land, there was a lapsed option and, subsequently, another transaction or a realisation of development value through a deemed disposal of the same piece of land. The question is, therefore: in what circumstances, and in what way, can that subsequent manifestation of development value be argued back to have applied to the lapsed option which may be an entirely separate transaction but in relation to the same piece of land?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that it is an entirely separate transaction. If I grant an option for £1,000 to acquire an acre of land and the prospective purchaser
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0899">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>613</span>
fails to exercise the option, I collect £1,000. It reflects development value, because if the price attached to the land reflects development value, as this legislation is drawn I should pay my tax on that £1,000, which would be very nice for me, as I would have received £1,000 for nothing. If, in future, the land were disposed of in any way, that would be a separate and new transaction. I would not have thought that the one affected or impinged upon the other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That does not entitely answer the point. I do not wish to labour this unduly, but there seems to be an area of doubt about whether development value will emerge in relation to a piece of land in which an option is granted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister explained earlier that the normal practice would be that the Revenue will wait until an option is extinguished or consumed again within the basic interest of the land when the option is exercised. At that point the total consideration, plus the consideration for the option, would be regarded as the operative figure. But let us take the case of an option that lapses, where at that time it is not certain whether there is development value. In the case mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), there was doubt about whether there would be development value in the case of the gravel land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the situation in regard to that lapsed option if doubt would have been resolved by its exercise but if for some reason it is allowed to lapse? Is it then to be influenced by what subsequently happens to the land in a completely different connection?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the point made by the hon. Gentleman. I think that he is asking me to say how any dispute would between the Revenue and the taxpayer would be resolved in that kind of case. Would they take later events into account? Would any tribunal consider, whether this option reflected development value be influenced by what might happen later? The answer to that is that I do not know, but I expect that these matters will be taken into account. There may be an area of dispute. We do not live in a world in which there is certainty in every direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally in the case of a lapsed option, there would be an option to acquire land
	<span class='label label-info column'>614</span>
at a certain price which affected development value. If that was clear and the option lapsed, the Revenue would raise an assessment. If they raised an assessment, the taxpayer has his defences in the legislation to defend that assessment. But there may be disputes and arguments. There always are disputes with taxation matters, but the mechanism is there to resolve them. If the taxpayer can show that there was no development value in the option, taking into account future circumstances, no doubt no tax will be paid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Could I put a different case to the Minister and ask for his comments? Should there be a 	<i>de minimis</i> provision to prevent unnecessary bureaucracy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us suppose that a situation has arisen by which an option has lapsed and the man has received his £1,000 for nothing. The Revenue assess development value in that £1,000 as say, £200,000 and the rest as current use value. tax is payable on 80 per cent. of £200,000. If that were to happen frequently, it would be a considerable unnceessary burden to the Revenue. Is there any necessity for a 	<i>de minimis</i> provision in cases of that sort? Options frequently lapse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He still gets his £10,000 exemption. At the end of the day he still receives his exemption from tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought that under the discussion we had under Clause 8 the Minister made it clear that there was no base value for an option and the disposal grant of the option was itself of a taxable sum. That is not within the £10,000 coverage at all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should not have said there is no base value. The base value is nil. The realised development value is £1,000 and prima facie, tax is payable on £1,000. But the first £10,000 slice of development value is exempt, so in fact he does not pay any tax. I am sorry if I did not make that clear.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All the exemptions still apply. One looks at the financial year and if in that year there has been £	<i>x</i> development value realised which is taxable, one deducts £10,000 from that under the tax in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point, may I briefly make the point which I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0900">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>615</span>
made earlier in general terms—namely, that it is likely that the companies would have used up their first £10,000 perhaps in a single transaction of a completely different kind. Perhaps it might be worth considering whether for companies whose normal business this is there should not be some 	<i>de minimis</i> exemption merely because of the amount of labour involved in dealing with very small sums.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon Gentleman asks for more than £10,000. There may be other cases which may involve labour apart from lapsed options. People will use up their £10,000 exemption on every other small case which may come along later in the year, not merely in the case of options. The hon Gentleman asks for exemptions of more than £10,000. We could debate it again, but I think the £10,000 is a fair exemption. I take his point that the companies may have used it up and the later case may be possible, but that is in the nature of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to deal with another point raised by the hon Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) on subsection (4). This appears rather complicated, and is so to some extent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of the subsection goes against the scheme of things whereby we bring the option and the interest in land together and amalgamate them. It keeps them separate for these purposes. The main reason is to enable builders to get their stock-in-trade exemption in relation to options that were granted before White Paper day but may not be exercised until after that day. It is complicated and applies to Schedule 2(7).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The object of keeping these matters separately is to ensure that the full stock-in-trade exemption which a builder would have in relation to pre-White Paper day is maintained in the case where it was only the option that was granted before White Paper day but where the land was not disposed of until after White Paper day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we did not include this subsection, the builders would lose some of that stock-in-trade exemption in relation to the development value of the option. Perhaps I should try to explain it more
	<span class='label label-info column'>616</span>
fully. It is complicated, but representations have been made to us about this and the provision ensures that the exemption is not lost, as it would be if we did not include this subsection. It seeks to preserve the exemption for stock-in-trade in relation to options granted before White Paper day when the land itself was not conveyed before White Paper day.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to pursue the matter now in view of what the Minister said. I read it as being a friendly subsection and not a hostile one, and he has confirmed that. It appeared to go against the logic of the situation in that it would divide the matter into two separate interests, one of which would appear to qualify before, and the other afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I could ask the Minister to explain the matter when we reach Clause 16, which is the earlier of the two occasions when it could arise. On a preliminary reading it does not appear to make sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give that assurance. The hon. Gentleman is right. It goes against the amalgamation because we would have pre-and post-White Paper day as we have an exemption for stock-in-trade before White Paper day. There have been cases where options have been granted before White Paper day in relation to stock-in-trade where acquisition might well take place afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final point was about forfeited deposit. My hon. Friend dealt with that. Again a forfeited deposit in terms of development value is not very different from an abandoned option. The person who has been granted the option or received the forfeited deposit has received some money in relation to development value. I would interpret that as being reasonable to tax him in that way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</section>
	<div class='clause'>Clause 9</div> <!-- clause -->
	<section>
	<div class='title'>DEVOLUTION ON DEATH</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 62, in Clause 9, page 12, line 28, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'and</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>c</i>) disposal by the personal representatives (in Scotland the heirs and executors) shall be treated as disposal by the deceased'.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0901">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>617</span>
I hope I do not create too much anticipatory excitement on the part of my hon. Friends, and perhaps hon. Gentlemen opposite, when I confess that the amendments that I hope to move under Clause 9 will not set the political stage alight with controversy. As far as I can see, they raise no great issues of principle, and perhaps the Minister of State can accept them with ease.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose it is because of the nature of this Bill and its general complexity that even when something is stated in black, one has to table amendments to ensure that something about which we are talking is definitely not white. This amendment certainly falls under that category. In line 21 it states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"anything done by the deceased shall be treated as having been done…by the personal representatives".</p></blockquote>
However, I am assured that as the wording of the clause stands there are several anomalies which could be created unless the matter is spelt out more clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the question that if the disposal by the personal representative is to be separately liable for development land tax, this could cause all sorts of unfairness. It could mean that only base B in Clause 5 was applicable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
More importantly, it creates a question mark over, for example, the question of stock-in-trade held on 12th September 1974. The question arises: is the personal representative to be treated in precisely the same way as the deceased over the qustion of stock-in-trade? That would not be a question if the Bill could be amended in the way that we are suggesting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, there is the issue of what will happen over a second house which has been started on land held on White Paper day by the deceased, for which there has been planning permission, and the building of which the personal representative has to continue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are minor points which I am sure the Minister will go through very rapidly. I am assured by our legal experts that the Bill would be improved by simply spelling out the matter in the way which we have suggested in this rather innocent amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman moved an innocent amendment, but he raised some doubts in my mind. I looked again at the legislation, and the doubts are
	<span class='label label-info column'>618</span>
now completely resolved as the result of a piece of paper which has arrived before me. It appears that I was right in my assumption but I was afraid to say so until the arrival of that piece of paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I can explain the scheme of things which would, I hope, make the hon. Gentleman's amendment unnecessary. The Bill ignores the disposal of the property from the deceased under a will or intestacy to the personal representative. Therefore, any disposal by the personal representative is not treated as disposal by the personal representative in relation to cost of acquisition and everything else that the deceased entered into in relation to the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The personal representative will get a stock-in-trade exemption. This point is reinforced by Clause 16(4), which we shall come to later. The whole principle is that we ignore the disposal between the deceased and the personal representative and treat the matter as though the deceased had disposed of the property. Everything he has goes into the property when the personal representative disposes of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of doing it that way results in a small benefit—and we are always glad to come into Committee and give additional benefits—to the estate and to the personal representative. The full £10,000 is given to the personal representative. The deceased and personal representative are treated as one person. A full £10,000 exemption is given although, in fact, the deceased may have used some or all of that £10,000 during the year in which he died. The exemption goes over again to the full £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept this amendment—and this is only a drafting point—that exemption would not apply. It is purely an incidental and subsidiary point in relation to the amendment. But the legislation as it stands is very fair. It deals with the reality of the situation. There is no voluntary disposal between the deceased and the personal representative. The disposal may come later when the personal representative disposes to beneficiaries, heirs, legatees and so on. That disposal is treated as a disposal by the deceased and we ignore the personal representative almost completely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that assurance will satisfy the hon. Gentleman. I can think of no cases where the taxpayer would be disadvantaged by the way in which we have drafted
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0902">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>619</span>
this legislation. Indeed, there is a minor advantage compared with the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I trust that the Minister has not overlooked that once again we attempt to correct this extraordinary term "personal representative" which has no meaning in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am interested to note that another unnecessary explanation is given in Clause 9(2), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the personal representatives of a deceased person shall be treated as being a single and continuing body of persons distinct from the persons who may from time to time be the personal representatives."</p></blockquote>
I should have thought that it was a matter of settled law, even if is not a matter of using the term "personal representative", that an executor who is acting as an executor is acting, not in a personal capacity, but as an executor, and clearly any change of executor would not alter the fact that the property was in fact not being disposed of merely because the new executor was created or another former executor resigned or died. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that is the intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to clear this matter up, since "personal representative", if it meant anything in the law of Scotland, would not necessarily mean an executor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a previous subsection the Minister will remember that he gave the excuse for not using the words "heirs and executors" as being that those advising him thought it was important to spell out all the possible types of heirs and executors, such as executors dative, nominative, derivative, and so on. I do not think that that is necessary, but, if he wants to be longwinded, he can be. However, I should like his assurance that this subsection, as in the previous one, will contain phraseology with real meaning—"personal representative" might have a variety of different meanings in Scotland in this connection—and that the phraseology in our amendment or similar phraseology will be inserted for the removal of doubt.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. Crawford), who is distinguished once more by his absence, issued a Press statement after we last discussed this matter and pointed out that I was a bad representative of Scotland as I had not voted with him for an amendment which the Government had already
	<span class='label label-info column'>620</span>
agreed to consider off-stage. As he did not bother to put down an amendment himself, and as he is not here today to discuss this one, I think his words are a little hollow, but perhaps that is the way they operate in that funny party of his. I hope that the Minister can assure us that the Bill will contain words which have real meaning in the law of Scotland and not a variety of meanings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other matter I wanted to raise concerns something the Minister said. It is not clear to me from the Bill. He said that, if a deceased person had in fact used up part or all of his £10,000 before his death, the personal representative would nevertheless be able to begin a new £10,000 from the moment of death. That may be so, but it does not seem to me that that is spelt out in this subsection. If the disposal is treated as
	<br><blockquote><p>"if it had been the acquisition by the personal representatives"</p></blockquote>
admittedly the personal representative will not have made any previous acquisitions, and to that extent he will not have used up any of his £10,000. That seems to me to be a derivative interpretation rather than an obvious one, and it would be wise if the Bill included words making it quite clear that that was the intention of the statute. If not, I have no doubt that there may be those in the Revenue or in the courts who would not put that interpretation or construction on these words.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. and learned Gentleman the assurances he seeks in relation to subsection (2), which was one of the first points he raised. He is, of course, right. It is a continuing single body. If there are changes in the members it is still a continuing body, and to some extent the object of the subsection is to ensure that there is only one £10,000. They are the one body; they get the one £10,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the £10,000 point, it is there by implication. I accept that it is not expressly there. But we are concerned only with that one particular piece of land. Again, the hon. and learned Gentleman almost answered his own question when he said that they are the ones that are treated as having made the acquisition and they have not used up that £10,000. They are, in fact, dealing with that particular piece of land. Some other land may have been disposed of by the deceased before he died, and he may have used up
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0903">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>621</span>
his exemption in relation to that. But in this case, it is the £10,000, and it is given to the personal representatives in relation to this disposal. They do not look only at the cost of acquisition; they take the cost of acquisition in regard to the deceased. But they are making the disposal and they have the realised development value which is chargeable. They are a body of persons, chargeable on realised development value, to which the £10,000 exemption is given. They deduct the £10,000 exemption from that realised development value, so they get their £10,000 in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the law of Scotland, the hon. and learned Gentleman disappoints me—I am sorry to say this—by chastising Treasury Ministers, perhaps rightly, for not paying greater regard to the law of property in Scotland, if that is correct—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Law of succession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. But the right hon. Gentleman drafts his amendment in the names of a number of hon. Gentlemen, including the hon. and learned Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) and brings in the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"in Scotland the heirs and executors"</p></blockquote>
when the hon. and learned Gentleman has told us so often that those words do not cover personal representatives. He has argued that one cannot call them merely heirs and executors. There are different ones, and one cannot be equated with the other, so I am disappointed that he did not use the opportunity to set out these different executors and make quite clear to us what he failed to make clear before.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister misunderstands the position. In Scotland, personal representatives would include a very large number of people who are not heirs and executors. As I understand the matter, personal representatives in England are those whom we restrict to heirs and executors in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Executors nominative, dative, derivative, and so on, are still executors and the use of the adjective is merely to distinguish whether they were original appointees, or became executors on account of intestacy or the failure of the executors nominative to serve, or for a variety of other reasons.
	<span class='label label-info column'>622</span>
But that does not alter the fact that they are all executors. One gets big, small, stupid and sensible men, but they are all men, and if one means men, then one does not need to give continuing classes of them. Heirs and executors are the only people entitled to intromit with a deceased's estate—intestate, testate or however. Therefore, that phrase covers all persons entitled to intromit with the deceased's estate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise if I misunderstood the hon. and learned Gentleman. He has made it absolutely clear. As he knows, we are seeking to amend Clause 46 to take care of these matters. Indeed, he may have noticed that the parliamentary draftsman has left the Committee and has not been here for a long time. I understand that he is scribbling away and delving into Scottish legal cases to make sure that by the time we get to Clause 46 we shall get it absolutely right. I have no doubt that he will read the hon. and learned Gentleman's remarks with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That probably deals with the points that were raised on Clause 9.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Standing aside from the Scottish issue, where I must say that I cannot even pronounce the words, let alone understand them, I think we can safely leave the defence of the entire Scottish people to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Fairbairn) singlehandedly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to comment on the substance of the Minister's reply. While it is the case, as we constantly say in this and other Committees, that a Minister's assurances do not carry the force of law, I should like to advise my hon. Friends to accept the assurances courteously given by the Minister on this issue. He has cleared the worry left in my mind. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 137, in page 12, line 28, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>d</i>) any expenditure incurred by the personal representatives shall be treated as expenditure on improvements for the purposes of section 5'.</p></blockquote>
In the last debate the Minister indicated that the personal representative and the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0904">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>623</span>
deceased, from the point of view of the Bill, were one and the same person. Although I understand that, it seems to me that the personal representative is, nevertheless, a taxable person. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that as a taxable person the costs he incurs should be fully allowable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, perhaps rather less innocently than on Amendment No. 62, specifically made the point that we consider that all costs should be included, not just the cost of relevant improvements. Is that idea acceptable to the Minister? We suggest that Schedule 3, which diminishes the allowable costs under relevant improvement, should not apply in this case. The personal representative is not a beneficiary and, therefore, should be allowed all his costs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further, we ask implicitly in the amendment that the incidental costs which are liable on acquisition and disposal shall be included in incidental costs incurred, for instance, in the continuation of any buildings which are allowable on the land held by the personal representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like an assurance from the Minister on the general question of costs of the personal representative and the deceased—namely, that these are to be aggregated. That applies not just to the question of personal homes held by the personal representative but to farms as well. Therefore, in many cases it could he of considerable importance that the Minister should make clear that all costs incurred by the personal representative should be allowable for the purposes of the tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked me to make clear that all costs incurred by the personal representative will be allowed. I do not rightly know what the hon. Gentleman means by "all costs", because whereas some costs will be allowed other will not. Costs incurred in administering the estate generally will not be allowed in relation to the tax. They may be allowed in other tax matters—I do not know. Expenditure on improvements, however, which would have been allowed to the deceased, will continue to be allowed. Any expenditure on improvements which enhance the betterment value of the land will be deductible in computing the final tax liability when the personal representative sells the land. But the
	<span class='label label-info column'>624</span>
representative has general costs in respect of administering the estate which may not be reflected in any improvement for the betterment value of the land. Those costs will not be allowed, and I cannot go along with the hon. Gentleman on that point. Only costs for increasing the value of the land will be allowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a further exception, which I shall quote, as there may be doubts on the subject. The exception relates to expenses incurred in establishing, preserving or defending the personal representative's title to the interest in land. Those costs will be allowable as expenditure on improvements. This aspect arises from the capital gains tax legislation, from a case decided in the courts, Commissioners of Inland Revenue 	<i>v.</i> Richard's Executors, which dealt with the capital gains tax equivalent of the wording in this Bill. That case held that the expenses incurred in ascertaining and valuing the estate, paying estate duty and obtaining confirmation—which I believe is the Scottish equivalent of probate—fell within the provisions for preserving or defending title, and those costs can be apportioned 	<i>pro rata.</i>

Therefore, in respect of that exception costs of improvement, and of defending and preserving title, are allowed. The general costs involved in the administration of the estate, because they are not reflected in the development of betterment value, will not be allowed against this tax, although they may be allowed against some other tax which might be imposed upon the personal representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In relation to the costs of preserving title, there is a scale of expenditure which has been agreed with the Law Society and the accountants' bodies in England. In Scotland these costs are broken down; and, therefore, it is not a problem. But general expenditure and costs are not allowed, merely costs of essential improvement and expenditure in preserving and defending title as laid down in this authority—CIR 	<i>v</i> Richard's Executors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take up a point where I thought perhaps the Minister might have expanded in an effort to reassure the Committee. He said that where the costs of the administration of the estate are necessary for defending title, as opposed to improving the development value of the land, those costs would not be costs which could be taken to diminish development land tax, but they might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0905">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>625</span>
be considered for diminishing other sorts of tax. I suppose he must be talking about, for instance, the capital transfer tax. I shall be interested to know whether costs of administration can be considered for diminishing capital transfer tax where the transfer is made upon a death.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know the answer to that question. In some circumstances the cost of administering an estate might by deductible against other taxes. There might be cases of income tax where money comes in from investments. There might be a range of situations where expenses would be allowed against other taxes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point that I was making was that in this case we are concerned only with expenses that improve the betterment value of the land. If expenses go to enhancing the betterment value of the land, then those expenses are properly deductible in computing development land tax at the end of the day. General expenses in administering an estate will not in themselves improve the betterment value of the land. I suggest that it is not proper to allow them as deductions in relation to this tax, whatever may happen in relation to other taxes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's argument: he is saying that, where the costs of administration have nothing to do with improving the development value of land, it is not proper to allow them for offsetting liability for this tax. But it is not good enough just to say "They might be allowed in relation to another tax". If he is going to make a remark like that, we must know whether there are circumstances in which they can be allowed against another tax. One cannot say blandly "They might be allowed". If the Minister makes such remarks, we should like to know in what circumstances they are allowed against another tax—for instance, capital transfer tax where such tax is payable on death.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One example could be if I were an executor taking over a business and had to dispose of or run that business for some considerable time. I would expect the general expenses of administering that business to be acceptable in computing my liability as a
	<span class='label label-info column'>626</span>
personal representative. Personal representatives have to pay income tax and one supposes that if they are companies they also have to pay corporation tax. If the hon. Gentleman wishes me to withdraw my remark I will do so, and say that I do not know whether such expenses could be offset against other taxes. In this case expenditure on improvements is deductible. Expenditure in managing an estate, whatever the position might be in relation to other taxes, is not deductible for the purposes of this tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Oh!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman content himself with that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is all very well for the Minister to say "I expect that those expenses could be offset." I expect they could. If all laws were fair—whatever "fair" may mean—they ought to be offsettable. But we should like to know whether in law they actually are offsettable. If one cannot offset them, for instance, aganist CGT, there may be an argument for allowing them to be offset against development land tax. If the Minister is going to argue to the effect "We can probably offset them against another tax", we should like to know accurately what the position is.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to disclaim any idea in this amendment that all the expenses of the personal representative should be fictitiously adopted as expenditure on improvements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 9 (1) (	<i>b</i>) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any expenditure incurred by the deceased shall be treated as having been incurred by the personal representatives."</p></blockquote>
In interpreting that, one then turns to Schedule 31 (1) (	<i>b</i>) and learns that one can deal with that as improvement expenditure. One of those ways is in
	<br><blockquote><p>"establishing, preserving or defending his title".</p></blockquote>
I take that to be the matter to which the Minister referred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, it is specifically said that expenditure by the deceased is to be
	<br><blockquote><p>"treated as having been incurred by the personal representatives."</p></blockquote>
Having specifically said that, it may well exclude the simple statement contained
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0906">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>627</span>
in the amendment that expenditure incurred by the personal representatives shall be treated as expenditure which could come within Schedule 3 (1). Having made the specific statement about the deceased's expenditure, I should have thought it necessary to make another specific statement about the personal representatives expenditure not that it necessarily is expenditure on improvements, but that it shall rank for consideration under Schedule 3 (1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister kindly quoted the case in which a part of the expense of getting probate is expenditure on
	<br><blockquote><p>"establishing, preserving or defending his title".</p></blockquote>
My recollection is that it is a Scots case and it would have been of help if he had put on record the name of the case and the reference to it. Is the Minister relying on that case, or has it not now been incorporated in the Bill itself in Schedule 3 (1)? Do we need to look back to the deciding case, or is it now incorporated in the statute? If we do not need to look at the case there is no need to put its name and reference on the record. But if we have to turn it up and say "This is a case for the interpretation of Clause 9", it should be on the record.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Taking the latter point first. The case in question was CIR 	<i>v</i> Richard's Executors, 1971, All England, page 785. The case dealt with similar wording in the capital gains tax legislation as that contained in Schedule 3.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The case held that expenses incurred in ascertaining and valuing the estate, paying estate duty and obtaining confirmation, which is the equivalent of probate in Scotland, came within that provision—that is, the particular provision which is within this schedule and in the capital gains tax schedule, and so be apportioned 	<i>pro rata</i> to each asset of the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, general costs of valuing an estate by a personal representative are not deductible. But if they are costs incurred in valuing an estate with the object of preserving or defending title, in this case it was decided that those costs are deductible. General costs incurred in valuing an estate, however, are not deductible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the point made by the right
	<span class='label label-info column'>628</span>
hon. Gentleman in relation to the drafting of Clause 9(1)(	<i>b</i>) which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"any expenditure incurred by the deceased shall be treated as having been incurred by the personal representatives."</p></blockquote>
Obviously, it is the view of the draftsmen that it makes clear that any expenditure on improvements incurred by the deceased and the personal representatives will be taken into account. However, I take the right hon. Gentleman's point that it does not say so. If one reads it first hand, it might not seem absolutely clear that it refers to the schedule and to expenditure on improvements in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see some validity in the right hon. Gentleman's point and, if there is a drafting problem here, we will look at it again to see whether we can make it clearer. I think, in practice, that it is absolutely clear that expenditure will be allowed. But I will look at it again to see whether we can make it any clearer. However, I cannot give a definite assurance that we will amend it on Report because the draftsmen obviously feel that it is sufficient as it stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the Minister's point. I had not meant to imply anything other than that general costs of valuation, and so on, would not be allowable.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of the amendments is to try to make it easier for private citizens who would be exempted or to whom the various exemptions would apply. The amount of £40,000 may be considered too high as the total exemption figure. On 	<i>de minimus</i> grounds, however, where the £10,000 exemption applies, private citizens should not have to go through what from their point of view may be the considerable expense of trying to apply the combined effects of Clauses 5, 9, 12, and 15, and to obtain advice on the matter, when under Schedule 2 we know that they are allowed to claim only certain expenses, namely, obtaining advice on valuation, apportionment, and so on, but not general expenses of getting advice on this kind of matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases, where private citizens have not had the benefit of three months of study, as we have, confusion may arise about whether they are personal representatives or beneficiaries and, more important than that, to go through the rigmorale of ascertaining whether they are eligible for exemption. It is the purpose of the amendments that the provision should apply only to those people to whom the exemption applies. We should avoid confusion simply by adding the words, in particular, of Amendment No. 138. It provides for a straightforward exemption for those with a market valuation of less than £40,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am prepared to accept that the Government may consider that the figure is too high, but I hope that they will accept the spirit of the amendment, which merely seeks to make life easier for the private citizen who would be exempt from the Bill's provisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked whether we would accept the spirit of the amendment. It is difficult to expect
	<span class='label label-info column'>630</span>
the Government to accept the spirit of an amendment in this Committee. I am not quite sure to what his amendment is directed. I hope that he will bear with me if I reiterate some of his remarks. As I understand the hon. Gentleman, he wishes to extend the exemption on private residences to a value of £40,000. Perhaps I might take the hon. Gentleman back to the clause and to Clause 14(7), which is the substantive clause dealing with exemption for private residences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 14(7) provides that any private residence exemption to which the deceased was entitled at the time of his death shall be available to his personal representatives if they dispose of it within two years of the death of that owner. When a person dies and his own main residence passes, as it would, to his personal representatives, and the personal representatives sell that house within two years, being the main residence and fulfilling the conditions in Clause 14, subject to the six month's condition which is not necessary to be fulfilled, there is the question of the payment of development land tax, assuming that the house has a development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have talked about £40,000, but in most cases there would be no development value. The house might be worth £40,000, but there might be no development value. If there was development value of the house, because the house was the deceased's main residence, and because if he had not died but had sold the house he would have been eligible for the exemption under Clause 14(7), his personal representative would get that exemption, too, if he sold within two years of the death. That is to enable the representative to wind up the estate and to sell off the assets or dispose of them to a legatee or an heir, and no tax would be payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the house is distributed by the personal representative to a beneficiary, who then lives in the house and fulfils the conditions of Clause 14, if he subsequently sells the house, even if the house has development value, no tax is payable, because the house has become the beneficiary's main residence. If the house is not the beneficiary's main residence and if he sells the house without having lived in it, after receiving it from the personal representative, the beneficiary will pay development land tax as the Bill is drafted, if there is development value and subject to the £10,000 exemption and any other exemptions there might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0908">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>631</span>
That is the position we are discussing. But the amendment seeks to go further to deal with a situation where a beneficiary does not live in the house. The amendment seeks to secure that if the benefiicary does not live in the house and sells it for less than £40,000, no development land tax shall be paid. I understand that to be the meaning behind the amendment. If that is so, I suggest that is being overgenerous because the beneficiary acquires the exemption from tax if he lives in the house. The moment he sells the house, the house has development value. I do not see why the beneficiary should be put in a better position than anybody else who acquires a house with development value and does not live in a house but sells it. Why should the beneficiary receive a £40,000 exemption, as opposed to anyone else who acquires a house not from a personal representative, but from the market?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The object of the £40,000 exemption was merely to establish a total market value below which one would not have to go through a whole rigmarole. The object was to set a price which would always fall within the £10,000 exemption merely to prevent a lot of bureaucracy from being created with private citizens having to go through this rigmarole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have said a price of £40,000 and not an exemption of £40,000. However, the argument still stands. Why should a beneficiary be given that benefit when other people do not receive it? I do not see what the difference is between the two cases. If the personal representative sells within two years, there is no tax to pay. That provision was introduced to simplify the matter. The personal representative does not have to look into all these matters of development land tax provisions and can administer the estate within two years without any difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I therefore cannot accept the amendment, because we have dealt with the administrative problem which enables the personal representative to go ahead and wind up the estate. If he disposes of it within two years, there is no tax on that disposal of the house if it was the deceased's main residence. If the beneficiary wants
	<span class='label label-info column'>632</span>
to live in a house, he will not suffer any tax if he sells while fulfilling the conditions of a main residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 139 follows on from that, and is directed towards the situation where trustees may own a house legally for the benefit of a life tenant. Under the legislation, the life tenant receives the same owner-occupier benefits as under the capital gains tax legislation. Amendment No. 139 would seek the same kind of situation as Amendment No. 138 in relation to that case where the property has passed under a settlement and the title of the house is in the trustees and not in the beneficiary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the same reason, we cannot accept the amendment because we have provided for the personal representative to have two years in which to dispose of the house tax-free, and if the beneficiary wishes to live in the house the tax-free exemption continues, even on disposal by the beneficiary, if it is the main residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I refer to Amendment No. 139? I see that my name is attached to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surprise, surprise!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Somewhat to my surprise! The last part of Amendment No. 139 says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"or such longer period as the Board may permit".</p></blockquote>
I expressly reserve my position in relation to those words. It would seem undesirable to give the Board a wide unfettered discretion which is wholly unrelated to any criteria.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want it to be thought that I am opposed to the Board having discretion in some limited way where Parliament lays down very clearly the principles upon which it should exercise its discretion. However, I do not believe it is right that Parliament should grant to the Board such a wide discretion as is envisaged in the last few words of Amendment No. 139.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can make my position clear in relation to legislation—I believe unlawful legislation—which is concocted by the Revenue and professional bodies coming to some extra-statutory agreement which they then impose upon the citizens of this country. I do not believe it is right to give the Revenue that sort of wide unfettered discretion. It is not right for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0909">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>633</span>
the country as a whole, and I think it could lead to very unfortunate results which would affect the whole probity and integrity of the Revenue in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish expressly to reserve my position in relation to the last part of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure I shall not convert my hon. Friend on this matter. There is a split on this side of the Committee. The words are taken from existing legislation where there is a permissible extension of time; hence it is reasonable that the Board should be allowed an extension in the same way. However, that does not alter the principle of these amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The one point with which the Minister did not deal in his reply to my hon. Friend is the position if the personal representative, having a power to distribute in kind, insists on so doing. He agreed that if the personal representative sells the deceased's main and only residence, that disposal does not attract tax. But there may be an obstinate personal representative who says "I will distribute the estate in kind." Perhaps he has been given that power as a trustee and he transfers it to himself and insists on distributing it in kind under a family deed of arrangement. One of the beneficiaries receives the house. However, he does not want to retain it as his main residence, but merely because he, and not the personal representative, has to sell, the Board of Inland Revenue insists on the tax being paid. That may raise an unfair position, particularly if it is the case of a spouse under Amendment No. 139.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments are both very restricted; in the first case by the £40,000 limit. Be it £40,000, £20,000 or whatever it may be, it is reasonable to apply a limit. The second is the case as between two spouses, the deceased husband and his surviving widow. There again, it is a very restricted amendment, but I think that there should be some provision to cover the case I have mentioned. The personal representative could sell and avoid tax, so when it reaches the beneficiary, either a general beneficiary or the surviving spouse, if the sale is within a short period it should have the same relief as if the personal representatives had sold.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only point I should like to make is that one is not
	<span class='label label-info column'>634</span>
trying to create a new exemption, although those of us who have been on Committees on Finance Bills spend our time in opposition trying to create exemptions and then showing the Government to be absurd for agreeing, because they create anomalies in so doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to make the whole thing simpler. It is in the interests of simplification, not so much a question of trying to reduce bureaucracy, and so forth, but of making it easier for the citizen to understand. The citizen would understand some kind of market value by which the tax was not applicable, but having to go through the rigmarole of computing on the basis of Clauses 5, 15 and 12(9), is a complex and expensive operation. This Bill does not allow this kind of expense in computing the tax situation to be allowable. Therefore, one is trying to press for a simplification and not, as I think the Minister implied, to create a special category of exemption.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is nothing wrong with trying to get an exemption. I do not criticise the hon. Gentleman if that is his intention, but that is the effect of the two amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect, it is bound to be the effect, because if the hon. Gentleman is saying, as I understand from these amendments, that if within a short period a beneficiary sold the residence that was devolved and distributed in the estate for a sum less than £40,000, no development land tax would be payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the legislation is presently drawn, development land tax would be payable if that beneficiary did not live in the house. If the house had developed in value, and if the development value exceeded £10,000, there would, as presently drawn, be a tax. Under the amendments, no tax would be chargeable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle is to establish a market figure which, by common precedents, would be one in which the £10,000 slice would apply. Perhaps £60,000 would be a more reasonable figure. One is only trying to suggest that there should be some straightforward figure which the public would understand and which would prevent them from going
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0910">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>635</span>
through unnecessary computations in order to arrive at an exemption to which they would have been entitled anyway.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take that point. The hon. Gentleman is saying that, instead of having a £10,000 slice exemption, we should say that any land distributed, or sold, that is worth, say, £30,000 or £40,000, shall be exempt. That has been tried in previous legislation. To some extent, it was the intention for this legislation, but the problems in relation to that kind of situation are that there would have to be some tapering relief. If I sold for £40,000 and paid no tax, and then if the tax is to be at 80 per cent. on sales in excess of £41,000, it would be extremely unfair to the man who sold for £41,000. So above the £40,000 there would have to be some kind of tapering relief which would take it to, perhaps, £70,000 or £80,000, which would make it even more complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why generally in the legislation it has been decided to have a slice exemption; the first £10,000 of development value is tax-free. It is not a case of someone selling land for £10,000 not paying tax, although that might be the case as well, because in that situation one would need a tapering relief. That decision is based on a first slice exemption. I accept the hon. Gentleman's desire to make things easier, but it would not do so. I assure him that there would be problems in that as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked what would happen if the beneficiary sold off having received the asset in specie from the interested person. The beneficiary would then pay tax whereas if the interested person had sold no tax would be payable. That may seem unfair but the persons interested are under a duty to consider beneficiaries before they distribute the estate. I should not have thought that there would be many solicitors as personal representatives who would go charging off distributing the property to the beneficiary knowing that the property was going to be sold. I should have thought in most cases these matters would be dealt with on the basis of that duty. The personal representative would of course, first ascertain the intentions of the beneficiary. If his or her intentions were to sell the property within a short space of time, I should have thought that the proper way
	<span class='label label-info column'>636</span>
of operating would be for the personal representative to sell the property himself or herself and get the complete tax exemption. I imagine, in practice, that is the way in which such matters are dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But my point is that if the beneficiary wants the exemption, he or she, spouse or not, has the perfect right to live in the property, to use it as a main residence and then no tax is payable at all on a disposal, if it is a main residence. That is one of the main reasons why we cannot accept this Amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The purpose of the amendment is simple. It is to inquire of the Government why a legatee should, in this Bill, be discriminated against. If the Amendment is not accepted the implication of the Bill as it stands is that the legatee will not be treated as he should be, in the way that personal representatives are treated, as
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0911">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>637</span>
merely filling the shoes of the deceased. He will be subject to the provisions under Clause 10, whereby the special addition no longer applies to him. So unless one accepts that a person dies in order to avoid tax—I suppose one could make that suggestion—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not my learned Friend appreciate that hon. Members opposite always regard death as a loophole out of life?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. That illustration may well be the only one which has a satisfactory conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought the Government must have accepted that a legatee should be treated merely as filling the shoes of the deceased. That being the case, there is an onus upon the Government, if not to accept this particular amendment, at least to ensure that the legatee is not subject to the discrimination to which he will be subject if it is left at the moment, at least if the provisions of Clause 10 are to apply to him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) asked why the legatee was discriminated against. I do not think that one can look at it in quite that way. Under the Bill as it stands the transfer of land to the executors is not taken as a disposal by the one, or the acquisition by the personal representatives. There is no disposal or acquisition and, in the words of the hon. Gentleman, the executors stand in the shoes of the deceased. That is the position—and we understand it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to ensure that this provision should extend to the inheritor, so that the inheritor will be in precisely the same situation, not only as the executor but also as the deceased person, and I understand that. I think the hon. Gentleman perhaps has not quite taken fully into account that under the Bill the inheritor is treated as acquiring that land from the executors for no payment. No payment passes, obviously, between the executors or the personal representatives of the deceased, and the beneficiary. As a result of this, the cost of land, the improvement expenditures, and so on, are those of the deceased, so all these costs of acquisition and the improvement expenditure carries right through from the deceased person, or the executors and through to the beneficiary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>638</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main difference is the fact that the exact special addition does not apply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was coming to that precise point. Up to this the position is the same. The difference is that under the Bill as drafted the special addition does not continue, but under the amendment the special addition would continue. What is this special addition? This is an addition which says that, if a person has been in the possession of land, there should be a certain amount of relief to allow for the financing of that land. This is so, because anybody who has held land for a long period might be making arrangements to have purchased that land, and in order to allow for this, the special addition is provided for that particular financing. But the need to allow for that financing—the special addition—clearly applies to the person who actually bought that land—the deceased person—but it cannot apply to the beneficiary. The beneficiary did not buy anything. He was given that land through the executors from that deceased person. He did not buy that land. He did not have to undertake any financing of that land, so why should the special addition apply to him, since the legatee has not borne any of those costs which are the precise intention of the special addition? That is what I want to say on subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On subsection (5), which the hon. Member did not deal with in any detail, he has perhaps a much stronger point, because under this a person becomes entitled to land under some particular deed. Under the arrangements made by the deceased person in his will, or it may be an intestacy, there was a certain division of the land between beneficiaries. Along comes the deed of family arrangement or some other similar deed, and they say that this arrangement need not be pursued in that way, in the interests of all at stake. As a result of this, the arrangement is varied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If this were to happen, there could be some DLT liability, and I can see that there is a case for examining the part of it which would vary the intentions of the deceased, but not in a way that perhaps ought to ensure that the land becomes chargeable to DLT. It could be that the deceased had certain intentions in mind and, because of the wording of the will, the effect of the intention of the testator
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0912">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>639</span>
was changed and the personal representatives under the deed of family arrangement, in seeking to produce perhaps the results that the deceased had in mind, unwittingly find themselves liable to DLT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think there is a case here for further examination. It is a useful point and I should like to consider it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I entirely understood the purport of the Financial Secretary's remarks. It may well be lack of comprehension on my part, and I ask in a questioning spirit rather than an aggressive one. The purpose of trying to ensure that the special addition applies to the person who inherits the estate is to allow him to take forward, as I understand it, any liability to interest. That seems logical. Somehow, there seemed to be subsumed—I may have misunderstood the Minister—in the Financial Secretary's remarks the idea that the interest on the land or on the improvements simply came to an end at death. We have already discussed the benefits of dying, but one of the benefits of dying is not that the chaps who lend money suddenly cease to demand interest on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have totally misunderstood the Minister, but if he was saying that the interest element should not be carried forward on death, I do not understand the logic of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not so much the interest element as the special addition. I took the hon. Gentleman through the reasons for that special addition, which are in various parts of the legislation, for a very good reason. When a person has a property, associated with that property could have been some financing for it. This is a commitment that he had when he first bought the property and, as a result, that special addition was provided to allow for that kind of financing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to the beneficiary, he has not been engaged in that activity. He has received what to all intents and purposes as far as he is concerned is a straightforward gift. No financing has to continue as far as he is concerned. In the case of the deceased person or any other person who purchased land there could be financial provision for that land, provision for which has to be made, and the special addition is precisely to take that into account. But that cannot be the
	<span class='label label-info column'>640</span>
case for a person who has received a gift of land. He has the gift of land. This probably is not a windfall in the way we were talking before, but it is not one for which provision needs to be made in the way that provision might, though not always, need to be made in the case of the original purchaser. Therefore, I cannot see why this should continue in the case of the inheritor. As I said, on the second point in subsection 5 of the amendment, I think there is a case for further examination and I shall be happy to give it that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the matter a little further? As subsection (5) in the amendment stands, it applies of course to the other part of the amendment as well, so that any beneficiary under the deed of family arrangement would stand in the shoes of the legatee in the earlier part of the amendment, and, if the whole amendment were accepted, he would be free from tax on disposal of the property which had been received under the deed of family arrangement. I suspect that the Financial Secretary does not wish to go as far as that but wishes to treat the transfer from the personal representatives to, say, the trustees under the deed of family arrangement, as dealing with the same people, as a continuation of the personal representative's capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am, then, not quite certain who is to get benefit from the Financial Secretary's further thoughts and concessions. The position here is that the personal representatives take over by virtue of representing the deceased. They then decide not to distribute the estate in accordance with the intestacy or the will but to distribute it in some other form by arrangement within the family. The transfer that then takes place from the personal representatives, to themselves, perhaps, as trustees under the deed of family arrangement, would obviously be free, would not be a disposal, as the clause stands at present without any amendment such as subsection (5) of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall be very glad if the Financial Secretary is giving us a little more concession than, as I see it, is already in the clause. That is why I press him a little further to say what he has in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman anticipated my views with great accuracy in that he did not expect me to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0913">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>641</span>
go quite so far as he originally asked. Indeed, I cannot go as far as that. I have undertaken to look at the particular parts of subsection (5) of the amendment which would result in a person becoming entitled to land under a deed which could be, as I said, brought about under some sort of family arrangement. In such a case, the person could take on the deceased's acquisition costs, the improvement expenditure, and so on, as if it were his own, and the dispositions of the deed are not treated as disposal for development land tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this part of the amendment the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) and the right hon. Gentleman have made a useful point, which certainly needs to be looked at again. There are some echoes of this in other parts of legislation of which I am aware and, because of this and the intricacies involved, I should like to look at this and see what I can come back with on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Naturally I am grateful for small mercies. I hope they turn out to be large mercies when the Financial Secretary has considered subsection (5) carefully again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>642</span>
The point I made clearly is not going to be accepted, but I maintain that it is illogical to allow the inheritor everything, from the point of view of calculating the DLT, other than the special addition, when he may have to incur as many interest rate charges as the person whose shoes he fills. However, I think this will have to remain an issue between us. I do not think that my hon. Friends will wish to press this to a division, and on that ground I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
