	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that with this amendment we are taking the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>No. 345, in page 58, line 38, leave out 'exempt'.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should respond, though not at length, to some of the points made by the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) at our last sitting. He asked a specific question concerning land acquisition and management schemes—whether the net of tax arrangements would in some way make these schemes more difficult to operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that there should not be a problem. If authorities wish to redistribute benefits from dealing in land, whether from net of tax or from other increases in development value, to one or more authority, they can do so. They can do this by having a joint account or, if they are in surplus, they can use part of their 30 per cent. retained share for such payments provided that these schemes allow for that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1334</span>
I am told that authorities are well aware of the proposed principles for buying net of tax when drawing up their management schemes, and there seems no reason to suppose that their arrangements will need to be changed at this stage to take account of the net of tax arrangements. If there are problems in future, we will endeavour to ensure that they are dealt with and that the net of tax arrangements conform to the principles of the land acquisition and management schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also raised a question regarding net of tax arrangements and, I think, powers of entry. The point he made was that a local authority, instead of agreeing a current use value with the vendor, or if the vendor was reluctant to agree the authority's current use value, might say "We will not bother about this. We will move on to your land, buy it compulsorily and you can argue afterwards". In this way the authority could sit on the man's land and he would not be able to dispute the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that if local authorities did invoke these powers, and I doubt whether they would in practice, they are likely to be faced with demands for 90 per cent. advance payments of compensation, and will have to pay interest on the compensation under Section 32 of the Land Compensation Act, 1961 from the date of entering until the date of payment. That interest will be payable on the gross amount of compensation before any deduction for DLT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is true that the authority need not send a notice of acquisition to the Board until the compensation has been agreed or determined, but if the vendor supplied the necessary information direct to the Board it could compute his liability and repay any excess of the amount deducted by the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The protection is, therefore, twofold. There is the protection of having to pay compensation and interest, and there is the protection of the Board of Inland Revenue, which will stand behind him, as it were, and the Board will then have the information and can repay any excess of any amount eventually deducted by the authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think this will present a problem in practice. I cannot envisage local authorities operating in that way, and I think that these safeguards are quite sufficient to prevent them from doing so, even if they wanted to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1335</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see the slightest safeguard. I should have thought that it is part of the local authority's duty, faced with an obstinate vendor—I think that we would all be obstinate in those circumstances—to take what steps it can to enter. If that gives rise to a 90 per cent. advance payment, local authorities may simply point to the schedule that the Minister has now tabled and say, "It is just the same; we can deal with it on a nine-tenths basis instead of a 100 per cent. basis". But the DLT deduction is still made from the 90 per cent. advance payment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is a problem. I think that the safeguards are sufficient. I disagree with the right hon. Gentleman. But again, in view of his experience in these matters— and I agree with him entirely that if local authorities were to operate in this way it would be intolerable because they would be using their compulsory purchase powers to determine a tax liability or a tax collection, and that would be wrong—I am prepared to look at this to see whether it might not be possible to introduce some safeguards into the legislation if we feel, on reflection, that there is a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's main point, I think, was in regard to the net of tax deduction. I think that we have been over this before. We have attempted in the schedule and by amendment to provide that local authorities will act only as tax collectors and that at the end of the day the Revenue will be the body to assess the tax and to repay tax if tax has to be repaid. I think that this will work</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question accordingly negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 445, in page 58, line 41, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'if before the disposal occurs the Board make an assessment to development land tax in respect of that disposal, then',</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1336</span>
	<p>well in practice. If there are any problems, we are constantly in touch with local authorities and we will attempt to iron the problems out. But I think we have come up with the best scheme that could be brought out in the circumstances, in view of the need to have a deduction of tax. I think that most local authorities are now happy that they will not be seen as tax gatherers but merely as the machinery to operate the land acquisition proposals.</p>
	<p>I hope, therefore, that the Committee will reject these amendments.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to say that I wholeheartedly disagree with what the Minister has just said. I think that he is over-optimistic that the local authorities will be satisfied with this procedure. Certainly, the ordinary individual cannot possibly be satisfied with the procedure in the way that it has been described to us and how it will work. I think that we must divide the Committee on these amendments. They go to the root of the procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should prefer to have a Division here and now to record our dislike of the whole of this deduction procedure. Unfortunately, Mr. Crawshaw, I have an accommodation with the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), as we are both on the same Committee further down the passage, so although I am asking my hon. Friends to vote for the amendment I shall be unable to use my own voice to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>The Committee divided,</i> Ayes 5, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to tkae the following Amendment No. 184, in page 58, line 43, after 'a', insert reasonable'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 185, in page 58, line 44, leave out 'any' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'an appropriate estimate of the'.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1337</span>
Sub-Amendment (b) to Government Amendment No. 406, in line 22, leave out from 'disposal' to 'made' in line 23 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'the Board shall make an assessment for development land tax'.</p></blockquote>
Sub-Amendment (f) to Government Amendment No. 406, in line 109, leave out paragraph 5.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall deal with Government Amendment No. 406 when we deal with Schedule 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to deal first with Amendments No. 184 and No. 185, which would stand on their own as drafting amendments to the clause. Assuming there is to be a DLT deduction, and that we retain the two methods of that deduction—either the specified amount or the formula deduction—the last four lines on page 58 need a little more reasonable drafting, towards the vendor, than as they stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 184 says that the deduction must be "reasonable". The clause gives a complete power to the exempt body to make a deduction on account of any development land for which the chargeable person may be liable on the disposal. The discretion is left entirely to the exempt body, and it is not even curbed in that discretion by the word "reasonable". However much we may squabble over other matters in Clause 38 and in Schedule 7, I can see no reason why the Minister should not accept this modest proposal that the deduction should be a "reasonable" deduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 185 seeks to insert, when the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>"on account of any development land tax"</p></blockquote>
is used in this part of the clause, the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"an appropriate estimate of the development land tax".</p></blockquote>
Again, this is making the exempt body think a little before it deducts some arbitrary sum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As these few lines are drawn, they are giving the exempt body a very arbitrary power. I do not say that every exempt body will so disregard the rights of the vendor as to act in an arbitrary way. At least we might call attention to the fact that they body must act reasonably.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If those two amendments were accepted—and there is nothing in principle about
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1338</span>
them; it is merely a tidying-up exercise—these four lines would read:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the body shall, on paying the consideration for the disposal, make a reasonable deduction in accordance with this section on account of an appropriate estimate of the development land tax for which the chargeable person may be liable on the disposal."</p></blockquote>
Those are what I have called two drafting amendments, but they are of some importance. Amendment No. 445 seeks to insert the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"if before the disposal occurs the Board make an assessment to development land tax in respect of that disposal, then"</p></blockquote>
the body shall calculate and deduct the amount of the assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
4.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequential amendments are our Amendments (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>f</i>) to the Minister's Amendment No. 406. Amendment (	<i>b</i>) merely follows, in the detailed procedure set out in Schedule 7, the idea that there should be an assessment before a deduction is made. It is very much the point which we were arguing previously. If an assessment is made, we get the independent body—the third party to the transaction, the Board of Inland Revenue—saying what the amount would be rather than leaving it to the exempt body, because the higher the figure the more the benefit to the exempt body, even if it may have to pay some of it back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Opposition seek to have an assessment first by the Board and to have that amount deducted. Of course, there would then follow a major amendment to the Minister's amendment to delete the whole of the formula deduction procedure, that is, paragraph 5 of Amendment No. 406.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These three amendments—Nos. 445, 406, (	<i>b</i>) and (	<i>f</i>)—seek to have an assessment first and, if a figure is given by the Board for deduction in that assessment, the exempt body would then be entitled to deduct that amount. We then do not have this arbitrary formula procedure, of which I think the local authorities would be bound to take advantage because they will see the difficulty in delaying it while an assessment is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman moved Amendment No. 445 but dealt first with Amendment No 184 and 185, so I shall reply to them in that order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1339</span>
Amendment No. 184 seeks to insert the word "reasonable" and to provide that the local authority or the exempt body, if different from the local authority, shall deduct tax as shall be reasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 185 seeks to insert the words "an appropriate estimate" of the tax. Again, as I understand it, the object is to give the local authority wide discretion to deduct what it considers a "reasonable" amount of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that perhaps these amendments were tabled before Government Amendment No. 406 which provides for our formula deduction. The right hon. Gentleman said that they were drafting amendments, but I am sure he recognises that they go a little further than that. Indeed, if we were to accept the amendments, not only would it go against our proposals for a formula but the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) would berate us for doing so, and he would be right. Hon. Gentlemen opposite who spoke on the last amendment said we were proposing to give too much power to local authorities yet here we are asked to provide that the town clerk should decide what tax is reasonable to be deducted from the purchase price. Surely hon. Gentlemen would not take kindly to that proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have provided for a formula deduction. I accept that hon. Gentlemen may not agree that this should be a net of tax provision at all. But, given the net of tax proposals, the way we have dealt with the matter is far superior to any suggestion that there should be a deduction of a reasonable amount of tax. In fact, we have tried to take any discretion away from the local authorities. There is very little discretion left. There is the question of current use value, which I accepted in the last amendment. But apart from that, there is no discretion. It is an arbitrary formula, and it is right that it should be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is for the Committee and the House of Commons to decide what the formula is to be, and the local authorities will then put it into operation. That is a much better way, as I am sure hon. Gentlemen will accept, within the limits of the argument about net of tax. We could not have this régime, with a local authority deciding reasonableness in matters of taxation. That would be a massive extension of our system with which I am sure no member of the Committee would agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1340</span>
Amendment No. 445 is taken together with sub-amendments (b) and (f) to Government Amendment No. 406. The object in Amendment No. 445 is that the acquiring authority may make a DLT deduction only when an assessment has been made before the acquisition occurred. The intention is that there shall be no deduction until the Revenue has raised a final assessment, when the vendor will go to the local authority, saying "This is my tax; now you deduct it."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, to some extent, provided for that kind of situation. I accept that it will be a minority case, but there is nothing to stop the vendor failing to sell his land until he has agreed an assessment with the Inland Revenue. There is nothing to stop him agreeing an assessment and the Inland Revenue providing the local authority with that provisional assessment. The local authority is then enforced to deduct the amount agreed between the vendor and the Inland Revenue. The vendor has the ability not to rely on the local authority but to go to the Inland Revenue. If he can agree a figure, the local authority will have to deduct accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a local authority used the vesting deed procedure in compulsory purchase, the vendor would have no alternative but to sell. When there is a compulsory purchase procedure, the vendor is not at liberty to hold back. He is faced with the possible entry, which we discussed previously, and the possibility, under the Community Land Act, of vesting procedure being used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept what the right hon. Gentleman said on the last amendment, that if they proceed to a compulsory purchase there may be a clash and some difficulty. I am prepared to look at that situation to ensure that local authorities do not use this power of entry to force a taxpayer into agreeing the amount of deduction. That would be wholly wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in the general case where the local authority would not want to proceed to compulsory purchase, the vendor has the fallback that if he does not agree with the local authority he can go to the Revenue. If these provisions were introduced, it would delay matters where a vendor may be quite happy to agree a price with the local authority and a valuation for current use value. If that happens, the sale should be allowed to go ahead and the deduction
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1341</span>
carried out in accordance with the formula. There is the fallback of being able to go to the Revenue for a provisional assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments would make the operation of the net of tax provision more inflexible, and for that reason it would not speed up genuine transactions where both parties want to reach a conclusion and where there is no dispute between the vendor and the local authority. I hope that the Committee will reject the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said that he could not possibly have a régime whereby the local authority was given power to decide, at its own discretion, what amount to deduct. Indirectly, of course, it must do that by having the power to decide the current use value. Let me remind him that that was how the Bill stood before he introduced his amendment to Schedule 7. It provided that the local authority could decide what sum it would deduct, and we had no clue then as to the regulations which the board was given the power to make, or indeed that the Minister would introduce some eight and a half pages of amendments in the schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having regard to what he has said now, however, I do not wish to press Amendments Nos. 184 and 185. I think that they would be wrong, in view of the amendments which he has brought in. We have to try to make his system work fairly to the vendor. The system of having an assessment first would be a full protection to a vendor, and if the vendor wanted to go ahead quickly, he could waive that protection to him. He could agree with the local authority the amount to be deducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, in this procedure we must work towards a definite sum settled by the board and not by the local authority. I laid down the principle in Amendment No. 445. If we can proceed, through the next few amendments, to see how we can bring the Minister closer to our ideas on that principle, we may achieve something.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before my hon. Friend seeks to withdraw the amendment, may I take up a point he made? He suggested that assessment by the Inland Revenue should be something which, at the discretion of the vendor, could be waived. I suggest that such a waiver
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1342</span>
would be a bad thing. We may see vendors lulled into a false sense of security by local authorities, because local authorities may say to the vendors—we are talking only about 1 per cent., the poor vendors and small landowners who will be caught—"We shall pay your legal costs and your professional costs. Leave it to us". In those circumstances, there is a great danger that the small landowner leaves it to the local authority and thus waives the right to go to the Inland Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would make it much better if there were an obligatory stage at which the Inland Revenue had to assess the tax. In that way, the element of independence would be built in, and there would be no chance of the Inland Revenue being short-circuited to the disadvantage of that small proportion of small landowners who are likely to be caught out by the mechanism as it now stands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen). The difficulty will be that the Inland Revenue will be over-burdened in assessing in time for completion of the sale and purchase. If, for example, the vendor did not agree with an assessment and wished to go to appeal on it, and we provided in the Bill that there should always be a final assessment before the sale and purchase took place, I fear it would result in delay in many cases, not just for weeks or months but even for years, while the argument over the assessment continued. If we could provide somehow that, in such circumstances, the vendor can—without prejudice to his claim—have his assessment put right, and agree that a deduction could be made, it would be a reasonable proposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My main worry is on compulsory purchase procedure. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he will look into this, but there really is a danger here in the two points I have made. If there is argument about the amount to be deducted the argument would be settled right away by an assessment. But if the argument goes on, then the local authority has all the power and the vendor has none. The local authority has all the powers that it can use when there is a compulsory purchase order both in forcing a completion and in forcing an entry on the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would look at this again. I assure him

that if he does not have something down on the Order Paper on Report, I certainly shall to try to protect vendors in those circumstances.

No. 398, in page 59, leave out lines 6 to 9 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'(	<i>b</i>) in relation to a payment of consideration and in relation to a material disposal in respect of which there is only one payment of consideration the "DLT deduction" means the amount of the deduction made from that payment in accordance with subsection (1) above, and in relation to a material disposal in respect of which there is more than one payment of consideration the "DLT deduction" means the aggregate of the DLT deductions made in respect of each of those payments.'.</p></blockquote>
No. 399, in page 59, line 27, after 'deduction', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'shown in the statement'.</p></blockquote>
No. 400, in page 59, line 29, leave out 'the' and insert 'that'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments relate to the provisions of Clause 38 and Schedule 7. The provisions of Clause 38 and Schedule 7 as drafted apply when only one payment of consideration is made and there is, therefore, only one "DLT deduction" in respect of any particular acquisition. It has become apparent, however, that there may be cases in which the consideration is paid by instalments. There will also be compulsory acquisition cases in which an advance payment of 90 per cent. of the agreed or estimated compensation is paid in accordance with the provisions described in paragraph 1(5) of Schedule 7 and the remainder of the compensation is paid later. The main Government amendment—number 406 to Schedule 7,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1344</span>
which we have already discussed to some extent—allows for a "DLT deduction" to be made from each payment of consideration in these circumstances. These Government amendments to Clause 38 make the necessary revision to the definition of "the DLT deduction" and incorporate consequential drafting amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
They are thus to bring Clause 38, in respect of the DLT deduction into line with Amendment No. 406, which, among other things, provides that there shall be a DLT deduction not only when there was one payment but when there is payment by instalments, or if there are agreed advance payments of 90 per cent. in the case of estimated or agreed compensation. They are consequential to that extent on the main Amendment No. 406 to Schedule 7 and will amend Clause 38 accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wonder if the Minister could identify the paragraph in Amendment No. 406 which deals with the position where the purchase money is paid by instalments. I observe a paragraph headed "Advance payments of compensation". Therefore, we are dealing with that one all right. But it is not easy to discover where this new schedule deals with the payment by instalments, which means a split deduction. Is there, therefore, protection to a vendor who is paying by instalments, not to have the DLT deduction on the whole amount taken out of his first instalments? If there is some arrangement by which the exempt body pays by instalments, we require to see that there is no deduction of the full DLT in the early stages of that money being paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure in what circumstances an exempt body would pay the purchase money by instalments. My understanding is that the Minister's amendments deal with cases where the purchase money is not due to be paid in one lump sum. I am searching my mind to think of cases in which it would not be so paid by a public body such as is listed in Clause 11. It may be that parts of the property were conveyed at different times, in which case there would surely be a lump sum in respect of each transaction. Perhaps the Minister can take us further into this so that we can understand it a little better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the latter point, the local authority need not necessarily buy the property compulsorily: it could come to an agreement with the vendor that the purchase price should be paid by instalments. I should not have thought that there was anything 	<i>ultra vires</i> in a local authority agreeing to pay by instalments. I would have thought that that kind of case would be covered. I do not know about the other cases, but this is one case that comes to mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the specific provision in the legislation. I understand that paragraphs 5(8) and 6(2) of Schedule 7 deal with the point regarding the deduction from instalment payments. Paragraph 5(8) is concerned with the formula deduction, and paragraph 6(2) is concerned with the case of a specific deduction. However, I have not had time to consider whether that deals strictly with the point that was raised or, indeed, with the question as to whether there would be some kind of apportionment or whether the whole lot will be deducted from the first instalment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps he could leave the matter there, and I can either come back to it on a later amendment, or I can write to the right hon. Gentleman. I am not happy in my own mind that this provides for specifically the question that he was asking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is convenient to come back to it on later amendments, I should be grateful if the Minister would do so.

Friends know the contents of that letter so that we may consider the matter further and see whether some amendments at a later stage are necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I spotted the one about the formula deduction when the Minister mentioned it, but I cannot find it in paragraph 6. If the formula is not being applied, a specified amount is being applied. However, let us leave that for the moment. I appreciate that originally in drafting Clause 38 evidently this had not been considered and it was one of the matters about which we have complained earlier on, but it was not fully thought out when it was first put in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='procedure'>
	<p>Sub-amendment (k) to Government Amendment No. 406, in line 234, leave out:
	<br><blockquote><p>'entered into on or before 12th September 1974'.</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>Sub-amendment (o) to Government Amendment No. 406, in line 275, leave out sub-paragraph (5).</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 262 is brief and to the point. Coupled with this, one has to amend certain parts of what I would call the main Schedule 7, because that contains a whole paragraph dealing with the payment of part of the purchase money to a mortgagee. Certain protection is given in the schedule to a mortgage which was entered into prior to 12th September 1974 but no protection at all is given to the mortgagee who advanced money after 12th September 1974. How on earth was he expected to know under the draft Bill, as it then stood, that if he advanced money on property he himself might have to pay development land tax? This is what it amounts to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Generally speaking, one would have expected the mortgagee to be paid out of the proceeds of sale—the purchase money paid by the exempt body to the vendor being the full amount of his mortgage and costs. This is the normal practice in conveyancing. It is the duty of the purchaser to see that the mortgagee—first, second, third and all the rest of the mortgagees, if necessary—are duly paid so that the purchaser can obtain proper title to the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have discussed this on a local authority basis so far. If the local authority has decided to purchase some property with normal compulsory purchase
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1347</span>
procedure, it would discover that there was a mortgage on the property and would be obliged to pay the mortgagee what was owing to him and his costs of clearing the mortgage in order to obtain the deeds of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But under the Bill we have the extra-ordinary position that, if that mortgage was entered into after 12th September 1974, it may be that in applying the formula under the new Schedule 7 the acquiring authority would have to deduct some of the development land tax, or all of it, from the money which would be due to the mortgagee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is so, I cannot imagine any building society, bank, or individual lender, lending money on property in future if the body or individual is to be faced with the possibility of having to pay the vendor's development land tax out of the mortgage money. The answer may be that in those circumstances it is unlikely that there will be any development land tax to pay if the purchase money is somewhere near the figure of the amount of the mortgage. Nevertheless, it is possible that there will be development land tax even in such cases. I appreciate the difficulty. There is the possibility that, if we said that the normal procedure would apply, the acquiring authority must pay out the mortgagee before it gets title to the property, but the vendor might have mortgaged the property up to 99 per cent. of its value and thereby avoid this deduction procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister uses that argument against my Amendment No. 262, which is a straight amendment stating that the mortgagee must always be paid the amount of his mortgage, the difficulty might be solved by a reasonable figure for the amount of the mortgage. If the mortgage is on the usual basis—that is, two-thirds of the value of the property—no mortgagee would expect to have the vendor's tax deducted from the proceeds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am open to any suggestion of modifying my amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) looks fearful, as he always does when I talk about modifying points. But, unless we make some reasonable provision for this problem, I cannot see that we shall have anyone advancing money on property in future. I used the phrase "building societies" earlier, saying that they would not advance money in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1348</span>
those circumstances. Normally they advance money on dwelling houses, which probably form the main residence of the chargeable persons. Therefore, it is unlikely that they would be liable for any of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But let us consider commercial property. Is anyone likely to advance money on commercial property in future if, when the mortgagor defaults and the mortgagee has to use his powers of sale and sells to the local authority or other exempt body such as the Scottish Development Agency or Letchworth Garden City Corporation, he finds that he does not have his mortgage paid out but has the tax deducted by that body? If it is a case of the mortgagee in possession who is selling, it means that the vendor is probably worthless. The Revenue will not wish to go against the vendor for the tax, nor will the local authority find any way of deducting tax for itself, because by that time the vendor is probably a man of straw. There will, therefore, be every temptation, when a mortgagee is selling to one of these exempt bodies, for the body to deduct the development land tax from the mortgage money. Certainly potential vendors will for see this happening, if their mortgagor defaults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
5.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I admit that the amendments I have tabled are tentative. The amendment which I seek to make to the new schedule—that is, to cut out the date of 12th September 1974—is a sound amendment. But I see the difficulty of avoidance if an owner mortgages his property up to the hilt. The Bill says that, if this property is sold to an exempt body, none of the mortgage money must be subject to tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that there must be a half-way house. If there is not, I am afraid we shall find nobody lending on commercial property in the future or on any large residential property which does not come within the previous definition of the "main residence".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After the Minister has commented, I should like to come back on this to see whether there is a solution. If the Minister turns it down completely, I am afraid we shall have to enforce the usual procedure. I hope that the Minister can solve the problem for me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has invited me to solve the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1349</span>
problem for him. I am afraid that I should be foolish to stand here and pretend that I have solved this problem. I do not go along with everything that he said, because people who lend money on the security of property in the future will appreciate that there are taxation provisions which could affect the value of their security. No doubt they will make their dispensations accordingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, it would be foolish for me to stand here and say that it is not likely to be a problem, because I can follow the right hon. Gentleman's argument and I can see that in some cases there might be a problem. Our difficulty is the point that the right hon. Gentleman made very fairly about avoidance—that there would be an incentive to take out high mortgages so that, if the Bill were amended in such a way, the local authorities would not be able to operate the net of tax arrangements. That would be a way of avoiding it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no desire or intention to inhibit commercial transactions or the borrowing of money on properties of this kind. The best thing I can say, rather than trying to fight the amendments or argue against them, is that there is a problem. There is a problem also about the date of 12th September 1974, because, as the right hon. Gentleman said, how could anybody know at that time— despite the fact that we had a White Paper—the full detailed provisions of the legislation? There would be no possibility of forecasting how this would be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise the difficulty both about the general point and the date of the cut-off. To some extent they are two separate points, although not entirely. I undertake to look at this and consult to see whether we can come back with something which will accord with reality and which will not inhibit—if there is a danger of that, in a minority of cases, because of these net of tax arrangements—the borrowing of money on land which has development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman is satisaed with that reply, perhaps he will consider not pressing his amendment. I assure him that we shall look at this as a genuine problem to see whether we can find a solution. It is not easy as he himself recognises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was in some ways an enheartening response from the Minister because he seems to have grasped
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1350</span>
fully the practical problems in the financing of property both for development and as security for other purposes which would result from the enactment of the un-amended Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in so many other cases in this legislation, it is a provision which is presumably designed to catch cases of possible tax avoidance—in this case, the artificial arrangements for mortgaging at an unrealistic value. As my right hon. Friend has mentioned, we are aware of the difficulty. But the converse difficulties are much greater. Since the Minister has been sympathetic to our point of view, I shall not press the case; my right hon. Friend has already made it so admirably. I shall, however, give three aspects of it which might help in its reconsideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the problem of refinancing. After a period of upheaval in the secondary banking area, there are how, as there could be at other times in future, periods when a substantial amount of property may be financed on temporary money from sources which may themselves not be stable. This would be a case of unstable lenders rather than unstable borrowers. So a natural requirement of the unwinding of such difficulties is that there should be no inhibitions in financial rearrangements and the refunding of loans and financial arrangements which are already in being. This would now apply to many cases which date back before 12th September 1974, or even any later date which the Minister has reasonably suggested might be applied, since the provisions could not have been known at that date. So there is an overhang from that situation which would need refinancing arrangements on a greater scale than might normally be the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second area of difficulty I foresee is where borrowing is required by a company against property that it may have owned for a long time and where perhaps for accounting or other reasons it may not be clear what cost could be applied to that property, or where its value is difficult to assess because it may have occupied the property for a long time and it may be the only factory of its kind in a small town. It may be impossible to assess what the rental levels to a third party might be if such a property were vacated. Therefore, the historic valuations in the books may not bear any close relation to up-to-date reality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1351</span>
In such circumstances, it is difficult to produce a valuation which would satisfy a lender and save him from the dangers of the subsequent development land tax deduction if, for any reason, the property were to be sold or acquired by a local authority under compulsory purchase or in some other way because the potential development value of such properties is often hard to assess. There is a sort of lurking development value on almost all such properties which, to some extent, is reflected in the current market value—even though there may be no immediate prospect of redevelopment—and with older commercial and industrial properties, this is an increasing problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tell the Minister that there could be a problem if finance is raised by a company which owns property not primarily for property purposes, but as longer-term finance to secure its resources for further investment, working capital, or whatever it may be. Since companies tend to raise their long-term capital in chunks, whereas their requirement for working capital grows more gradually, these things tend to take place in single large steps every now and again. One of those large steps which a company can take is to raise money on its property fixed assets, many of which it may have owned for many years. So that is the second area of problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third area relates, not so much to banking loans, but to mortgages and long-term lending. The shortest mortgage period normally acceptable to pension funds, insurance companies, and so on, is 20 years, and 25 years is very frequent. Over that period we run up against the illusory but none the less real factor of lurking development value, if I may so phrase it. One cannot put a finger on it, but it is there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over a 20-year or a 25-year period, any property, up to now, has been expected to have some inherent redevelopment value which, at a later stage, will justify a greater value for the site than the buildings themselves at that date, because factories wear out and offices have to be rebuilt. If there is no redevelopment value in the site, there is a potential decline in the value of that real proeerty over the period of a longer loan such as a mortgage. It may mean that there would have to be faster amortisation of long-term loans to industrial and commercial companies. That, I think, would not be the sort of strain on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1352</span>
cash flow which the Government would wish to impose on these companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not develop these points further, but having had as a banker some financial experience of discussing with companies their borrowing needs, both in the short term and in the longer term, I thought it fair to mention those three areas where I think there could be real problems if the Minister's thinking on the subject is not fruitful in the way that we hope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will think very carefully about this matter, and that he will allow himself plenty of time to discuss it with his professional advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me remind the Minister of one aspect of the Community Land Act. When we were discussing the arrangements for builders and how builders would be able to borrow money to finance their developments when all that they would get from local authorities was some form of building licence, we were told that it would all prove very easy and that it would be possible to provide some form of security on these building licences, a form of security which would be satisfactory to those building societies and other financial institutions which lend money to builders during the time that they are developing the estate and before they have sold any of the buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is always a fair amount of buzz around the corridors, and the corridor buzz that I hear about this is that the problem that we identified has proved to be a substantial problem, and that there is a good deal of relectance among financial institutions to get involved in lending any money against building licences which may be granted by local authorities to builders. So I hope that the Minister will be very careful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a substantial problem. At present the only safe basis on which any financial institution could lend money would be to assess the current use value at the time when the money was being lent. Provided they lent only to the full extent of the current use value, they would be protected. The subtraction of the tax would not make any incursion upon their security. But the difficulty is that the current use value is only a matter of judgment, and they might get it wrong.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has made an important point, but it is not even
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1295">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1353</span>
as simple as that. Suppose the property is acquired at a current use value of A, the bank lends when it has a current use value of C and the current use value then falls to B, there is still a gain, but the property could be worth less than the loan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is true. The point I made—rightly,I think—is that all they dare do is lend on the current use value at the time of the loan, but they cannot anticipate what the current use value will be in the future. So what they will say is, "First, we cannot be sure what the present current use value is and we cannot be sure what the prospective use value is. Therefore, the only thing we dare do is lend on two-thirds of the estimated current use value, if you like, or perhaps 50 per cent. of the current use value". The result will be that a large number of companies will find that the extent to which they can gear themselves is very substantially reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope I take my right hon. Friend with me to that extent. I expect our calculations may be such that reasonable people will disagree about the basis on which they will lend, but the gearing will be substantially reduced; and if we have a situation where the Government of the day are, for instance, talking about wanting to govern in the interests of the useful people, and not liking the speculators or the City of London and so on, and it has a consequential effect on share prices, the result will be that the only basis on which companies may borrow is against their property. They cannot borrow against their shares because they drop through the floor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government are serious when they say they want to encourage investment with a view to dealing with the horrifying problem of unemployment, they should look at this very carefully, because we are here chipping away at the base against which companies borrow for expansion and employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Very briefly, I should like to support my right hon. and hon. Friends. I believe the Government are serious in wishing to encourage investment. They are not serious in acquiring knowledge of the process, and perhaps do not have sufficient determination to keep certain hon. Gentlemen on their own side under control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1354</span>
We all know that investors in property, like those in industry, abhor uncertainty. We have seen the consequences of uncertainty and its serious effects on investment. We see it now in so many guises. We understand the fear arising from the Price Code, for example, which is currently under discussion. It is a major deterrent to investment, but it is a matter which we shall be discussing elsewhere rather than here. Here we are concerned with an additional unnecessary uncertainty with regard to the value of the principal asset used by small and medium-sized businesses as security against their debentures, bank loans, mortgages and other borrowings to finance their investment. In circumstances where we are trying, or meant to be trying, to encourage investment, I should have thought we ought to do everything we can to avoid increasing the uncertainty and, therefore, making the borrowing more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point which perhaps I did not make fully in my previous speech. One may have a feeling that if a person lends money on property, he has a legal interest in that property which is not very different from the legal interest of the owner himself, and that he ought to take the risk of paying tax. But the real difference is that the mortgagee has no interest in the equity of the property, and he therefore has no interest in the development value of the property. He does not benefit from the development value increasing. In fact, by law one cannot give a mortgagee a right in the equity. One might have separate contracts to do that, but it is not possible within the mortgage deed itself. It would be clogging the equities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see a friendly smile from my colleague behind the Minister, the right hon. Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Dunnett) when I talk of what we learned about during our student days about clogging the equity. But it is a point. Morally, payment of the money to the mortgagee in full recognises this fact, that he is not in there for a risk. If he takes the risk of advancing 90 per cent. on the property instead of the normal two-thirds, then he is taking some risk and I have not as much sympathy with him as I have with the person who is lending a reasonable figure.

(Mr. Stewart), with his great experience in this sphere, have asked how the man judges what is the two-thirds of the value at the time he is lending the money. I agree that that is difficult, but if he goes above that he takes risks, and I have not so much sympathy if he finds that he has to meet some tax eventually.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The solution is to go for a percentage of the value of the property at the time the advance is made. No doubt the lenders will always try to find out what the base will be if the property is being sold and make judgment on that when they lend the money and abandon the cut-off date altogether. There would be no distinction between those who lend before a certain date if one applies the formula provisions to a mortgage in possession selling if his mortgage is above a certain percentage of the value of the property when he lent the money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that this is probably the only solution, and I throw it out as something for the Minister to consider. The Minister has been generous enough to say that he will look at this matter again. He has understood our points on it. Perhaps he wishes to say something more about it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two problems. There is the problem of the cut-off point; but there is also the question of new mortgages. I do not want the impression to leave this Committee that people who lend money on new mortgages under the DLT régime should not have to take into account the fact that there will be a DLT tax liability. Anyone who lends money in future on land which has development value will value that land taking development value into account; but he must take into account what might be a prior charge. There will be a development land tax charge on development values, and it may be as high as 80 per cent. in some circumstances, depending on the value of the land. In future, lenders on new mortgages will have to take that factor into account, as now they take into account various other prior charges on land. When lending on a second mortgage, the first mortgage is taken into account, which is a prior charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want the Committee to think that in some magical way one can solve the problem of new mortgages, given the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1356</span>
new régime and the new situation in which we are involved, and given the fact that there will be a tax which is a prior charge on the land. Such matters will have to be taken into account by lenders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cut-off point and the date is a further problem because in many cases lenders will not have known what the legislation contained—there were no clauses at that time but merely a White Paper—and they would not have had the benefit of even seeing the draft clauses because they did not deal with this point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two points here. One may be related to the other but they should be looked at separately, and, with regard to new mortgages, we must recognise that once the tax becomes law lenders, like everyone else, will have to take into account fiscal changes when considering whether to lend money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather sorry I invited the Minister to speak again. He was not nearly so generous the second time as he was the first time, but I think that neither side of the Committee is firm on this. As I said earlier, I was not firm on the wording of the amendment; I was seeking a solution to the problem and the Minister has answered in much the same strain. I think we could leave this to a later stage in the Bill to see whether we can both find a proper solution. On that basis, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>No. 188, in page 59, line 24, after 'he', insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'may, prior to the date on which the payment of consideration is due to be made deliver to the exempt body a notice in writing of his objection to the statement, such notice setting out his computation of the amount of the DLT deduction and the amount actually to be paid by way of consideration, and the exempt body shall have regard to the contents of the notice and may (if it sees fit) amend the figures contained in the statement, and the chargeable person'.</p></blockquote></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These three amendments deal with the point of a notice being given by the acquiring authority to the vendor. The Bill, as I understand it, envisages that notice being given at the time that the transaction is completed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (4), to which Amendment No. 186 applies, says that when the consideration is paid and the deduction is made, the acquiring authority has to
	<br><blockquote><p>"furnish to the chargeable person a statement in writing"</p></blockquote>
setting out certain matters of vital importance to the vendor because the statement will tell him how much the local authority or other public body acquiring the property will pay him in cash after deducting the DLT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems grossly unfair on the vendor to swing that notice on to him at the last moment. He will not know what arrangements he can make with the proceeds of the property that he is selling, which is vital to any vendor. One cannot assume that every vendor has an obliging bank manager who will offer him a bridging loan every time a transaction takes place so that he can sit back and argue the matter out with the acquiring authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the acquiring authority should be under the obligation to give him notice setting out what it intends to deduct and to give it to him before the matter is due for completion. Therefore, Amendment No. 186 would oblige the authority to give this notice not less than four weeks before the payment was due to be made. It will not be easy perhaps, in a compulsory purchase, to know when the payment is due to be made, but possibly a little tidying-up of that would be necessary if the amendment was put in the Bill in those words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But, in looking at the ordinary transaction by contract, the vendor selling by
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1358</span>
agreement to one of these public bodies, the contract would have a date for completion, and it should be an obligation on the acquiring authority within this reasonable time before completion to say how much it will deduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vendor should also be entitled to object to the amount to be deducted. That will delay such transactions, of course. They will be delayed, anyway, and, frankly, I cannot see any conveyance being completed under these provisions of deduction of the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the vendor should not be presented at the last moment with a deduction from the purchase money without having a chance to make some objection to the amount which is being deducted. Even within new Schedule 7 there should be some provisions, such as these three amendments cover. I readily admit that they were put on the Notice Paper before the Minister tabled his new Schedule 7, but I do not think in this case it makes any real difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From a practical point of view, I envisage having reached the stage of completion of a contract for the acquisition of a property by the local authority or other body such as these development agencies, and, as the vendor's solicitor, one who has drawn up the completion statement setting out the apportionments of rates and other outgoings, setting out exactly the gross amount due on completion, sitting patiently in one's office for the solicitor to the local authority to turn up to complete. When he turns up with the completion statement showing the gross amount he says "I am not paying you that, of course. I am deducting this—here is the notice of what I am deducting". Under the clause as drafted, that is all he has to do. At the very last moment, when one is expecting the local authority solicitor to come around with the cash in his pocket, he comes round with something very much less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt, on the same day, one is completing another transacton for the same vendor, because so frequently these transactions are linked—not just two, but three, four or five in a row. How on earth one is to know how to run those transactions together I do not know unless there is this prior warning of the amount to be paid and some procedure
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1298">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1359</span>
for the objection by the vendor if he considers too much is being deducted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the Minister's answer will be that now, by the new Schedule 7, there is no discretion about the amount to be deducted and that it is all laid down in this formula if there is no specified amount. If that is the case, what is the purpose of delivering this notice at the last moment to say how much is being deducted? There must be some purpose to the notice and, if it is to have any purpose at all, it should be delivered some weeks before completion is due.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman wishes to extend the provisions of the clause, taking new Schedule 7 into account as well, to ensure that local authorities will have to issue a notice four weeks before they are entitled to deduct DLT, which would be at the point of completion, telling the vendor how much tax the local authority is proposing to deduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main objection to this suggestion is that in many cases it could possibly create more delay than the present arrangment. I accept entirely that when one has net of tax provisions of this kind, given the fact that we have amended Schedule 7 to provide that the vendor can go off to the Revenue and agree an assessment of the revenue, there will be possibly some delay. The amendment would increase that delay—and I think that the right hon. Gentleman accepted that—without really giving any greater protection to the vendor than is given under the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the point of conveyance is reached, there has to be a solicitor. I do not know how many peasant farmers who do their own conveyancing. There has to be a solicitor to deal with these matters. He will be in touch with the local authority and the question of deduction no doubt will be resolved in the ordinary nature of things while the contract price is being decided upon. I should have thought that if a local authority official arrived on the doorstep a minute before completion telling the vendor's solicitor for the first time that 80 per cent. of the purchase price was to be deducted that sale would not go through at that time and no local authority that wanted to buy land would behave in that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1360</span>
In practice, I do not think that this is a problem, given the fact that now we have a situation where the vendor can go to the Revenue. Had we not provided for that, there might have been a case for the right hon. Gentleman's amendment. But I want to stress that the vendor can go along to the Revenue and agree a provisional computation. He can then go back to the local authority and say "This is my agreement with the Inland Revenue—you deduct what we have agreed."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a very important safeguard. It also takes away from local authorities the possible opprobrium of being tax-gatherers or tax-assessors and makes it clear that it is the Revenue that decides these matters. If the parties want to agree, of course, they can agree and there is a formula deduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I really do not think that the amendment would improve matters. It would mean greater delay. Bearing in mind that we have now introduced amendments to Schedule 7, I do not think that the amendment is necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister keeps saying that the vendor can "go along to the Revenue", as if he can just take a l0p bus ride from Westminster to Middlesbrough, tap on the door of the Mandarins' Palace and say "Please let me in. Can I settle it at once? It is awfully urgent. I am completing this matter tomorrow and the Letchworth Garden City Corporation"—I apologise to my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart), let us say the Scottish Special Housing Association—"is going to deduct 80 per cent. of this money and I want to buy another property at the same time. What on earth am I to do?" Will he really get the Mandarins to come all the way down from the twentieth floor, banging their gongs—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

meet him to try to get things settled. We are dealing with the Palace of Middlesbrough and it will take a long time to get anything at all out of that lot. It really is exasperating for the Minister to keep saying that the vendor can just go along to the Revenue. It will take far longer than the four weeks in my amendment to get that notice served. Of course there will be delay over anything that one does about this in order to protect the vendor. If the vendor does not want protection or does not want delay, of course, he can settle it up with the authority itself and give in. But I want to give the vendor a reasonable power not to have to give in if he feels that he is in the right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is only an amendment on procedure. It is something that will have to be considered as part of the procedure when we have gone all through Clause 38 and Schedule 7 as it now stands. I do not feel inclined to persist with this one small piece of procedure to the extent of a Division at this stage, but I do say that we must look at this procedure as a whole and see that we are giving protection.

Perhaps I may explain the background to the amendment and the reasons for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1362</span>
Subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>) of Clause 38 provides that where an exempt body which acquires an interest in land and makes a DLT deduction from the consideration furnishes the chargeable person with a statement under subsection (4)—that is, a statement showing what the amount of the payment would be if no deduction had been made, the amount of the DLT deduction and the amount actually paid—he, that is to say the vendor is to be treated as having paid to the Board an amount of DLT equal to the DLT deduction. Subsection (6) of Clause 38 provides that any amount of DLT payable by the chargeable person in excess of the DLT deduction shall be payable by the Board to the acquiring authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These provisions run counter to two particular enactments which are set out in the amendment—Section 10 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866, and Section 1(2) of the Public Accounts and Charges Act 1891. Tax which would otherwise be paid into the Exchequer is, in the one case, not collected by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, and, in the other case, is to be handed over to the acquiring authority. My hon. Friend will be pleased to hear that this amendment gives clear statutory authority for the retention by, or payment to, an exempt body of the net of tax benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The new subsection (6A) of Clause 38 inserted by the amendment provides that any amount which is treated as having been paid to the Board by virtue of subsection (5)(	<i>b</i>)—a DLT deduction—or paid by the Board to an exempt body by virtue of subsection (6)—additional DLT collected on a disposal to an exempt body—shall be regarded as not forming part of the gross revenues which the Board is required to pay to the Exchequer, and as not being included in money and securities collected or received which the Board is required to pay into the Bank of England under Section 1(2) of the Public Accounts and Charges Act 1891.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, because of the collection procedure, whereby the tax goes to the local authority which retains the tax, it is necessary to amend legislation because of these two statutory enactments which lay down that the money should go to the Exchequer. In this case the money goes to the local authority, because it is deducting net of tax and keeping the tax. Normally the tax goes to the Exchequer
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1300">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1363</span>
and into the coffers of central Government. Here we are providing that the money shall remain with the local authorities, and the amendment is to ensure that the statutory authority exists to do so, and that the Board is not acting contrary to those two statutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment just shows how far we are in breach of the normal tax provisions and the normal financial provisions applying to central Government. Our predecessors in the Victorian era, in 1866 and 1891, were wise to see that Government accounts were kept in proper order, but here we are breaking that. This is a tax. I know that it is, as it were, a levy, because it does not depend on the normal taxation of one's means with reference to personal allowances, and so on. To that extent it is a levy, but it is, nevertheless, a tax. It is money which is collectable by central Government, and should go through the normal accounting procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment shows how we have had to tear that apart in order to allow the money to go direct to these exempt bodies and allow, for example, the Highland and Islands Development Board to tax people. That is the intention. That body, and others, are entitled to collect taxes, and to some extent decide how much those taxes shall be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said previously that I might be prepared to breach those principles for local authorities, but when it comes to allowing these nationalised bodies to break all the rules and traditions of our tax system, I get a little hot under the collar.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonn Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is unusual for the right hon. Gentleman to get so hot under the collar, or even to exaggerate, but to go back to the traditions of 1866 and seek to use those arguments against something which is the essence of this Bill seems somewhat far-fetched.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 38 is an essential part of the principle and intention of the Bill. It is, therefore, absolutely appropriate that the general provision which was laid down in 1866, and the Public Accounts and Charges Act 1891, should be varied in this way. I am only surprised that my hon. Friend in preparing the Bill had not spotted the point until now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<li>that notice of appeal has been given against the relevant assessment and an amount of development land tax has become due and payable under the Taxes Management Act 1970; and</li>
	<li>that notice of appeal has been given against the relevant assessment but no amount of development land tax has become due and payable under the Taxes Management Act 1970 and the amount of tax charged by the relevant assessment is less than the amount of the formula deduction, within the meaning of paragraph 5 below, which would be applicable to a payment of the whole of the consideration for the material disposal.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(3) Where the obligation of the Board to notify the acquiring authority of the amount of the specific deduction applicable to the material disposal arises by reason of the fulfilment of any condition in sub-paragraph (2) above, then—
	<ol>
	<li>if the condition fulfilled is that in paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of that sub-paragraph, the amount of the specific deduction shall be equal to the amount of tax referred to in that paragraph; and</li>
	<li>in any other case, the amount of the specific deduction shall be equal to the amount of tax charged by the relevant assessment.</li>

	<p>(4) Where sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 3 above applies, the Board shall be under the obligation specified in sub-paragraph (1)(	<i>b</i>) of that paragraph and in such a case the amount of the specific deduction applicable to the material disposal shall be equal to the amount of development land tax which, taking account of the variation referred to in sub-paragraph (4) of that paragraph, is charged by the assessment concerned or, as the case may be, has become due and payable under the Taxes Management Act 1970.</p>
	<p>(5) In relation to the exercise by the Board of their power to notify the acquiring authoirty as mentioned in sub-paragraph (5) of paragraph 3 above, the amount of the specific deduction applicable to the material disposal concerned shall be such as may be agreed between the Board and the person referred to in that sub-paragraph to represent—

	<li>the amount of his liability or prospective liability for development land tax in respect of that material disposal; or</li>
	<li>so much of the development land tax for which he is or will be liable in respect of that material disposal as is not in dispute.</li>

	<p>	<i>The formula deduction</i></p>
	<p>5.—(1) Subject to paragraphs 7 and 8 below if, at a time when a payment of consideration falls to be made in respect of a material disposal to which paragraph 1(1) above applies the acquiring authority have not received—
	<ol>
	<li>a notification under paragraph 2(1) above, or</li>
	<li>a notification under paragraph 3 above stating the amount of the specific DLT deduction applicable to the disposal,
<br><br><!-- lb --> the acquiring authority shall deduct from that payment a DLT deduction of an amount determined in accordance with this paragraph (in the following provisions of this Schedule referred to as a "formula deduction").</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(2) In relation to a formula deduction "the relevant payment" means the payment of consideration from which the deduction falls to be made by virtue of subparagraph (1) above; and any reference in this paragraph to the amount of the relevant payment is a reference to the amount of that payment before the formula deduction is made, but exclusive of any interest payable by the acquiring authority.</p>
	<p>(3) If the amount of the consideration for the material disposal does not exceed the aggregate of—
	<ol>
	<li>110 per cent. of the acquiring authority's estimate of the value which, for the purposes of this Act, is the current use value of the relevant interest at the time of their acquisition, and</li>
	<li>£10,000,</li></ol>
the amount of the formula deduction shall be nil; and in relation to a material disposal the aggregate amount determined under this sub-paragraph is referred to as "the exempt amount".</p>
	<p>(4) If sub-paragraph (3) does not apply and the material disposal occurs in an interim financial year, then, subject to sub-paragraphs (5) and (8) and paragraph 7(3) below, the formula deduction shall be whichever is the less of the following amounts, namely,—
	<ol>
	<li>50 per cent. of the amount of the relevant payment; and</li>
	<li>66⅔ per cent. of the amount by which the consideration for the disposal exceeds the exempt amount.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(5) If, in a case where sub-paragraph (4) above applies, the consideration for the material disposal exceeds the exempt amount by more than £150,000, that sub-paragraph and sub-paragraph (8) below shall have effect as is for paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of subparagraph (4) above there were substituted the following paragraph:—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(	<i>b</i>) £100,000 plus 80 per cent. of the amount by which the consideration for the disposal exceeds the aggregate of the exempt amount and £150,000".</li>
</div> <!-- ul --></p>
	<p>(6) If sub-paragraph (3) above does not apply and the material disposal occurs after 31st March 1979, then, subject to sub-paragraph (8) and paragraph 7 (3) below, the formula deduction shall be whichever is the less of the following amounts, namely,—
	<ol>
	<li>the appropriate percentage of the amount of the relevant payment; and</li>
	<li>80 per cent. of the amount by which the consideration for the disposal exceeds the exempt amount.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(7) In sub-paragraph (6)(	<i>a</i>) above "the appropriate percentage" means such percentage as may be specified by the Board by regulations made by statutory instrument; and a statutory
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1368</span>
instrument containing regulations under this sub-paragraph shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the Commons House of Parliament.</p>
	<p>(8) If, before the time at which the relevant payment falls to be made in respect of a material disposal, a previous payment of consideration has been made in respect of that disposal, then, in calculating the formula deduction, the amount determined under sub-paragraph (4)(	<i>b</i>) or, as the case may be, sub-paragraph (6)(	<i>b</i>) above shall be reduced by the amount of the DLT deduction made from that previous payment or, if there has been more than one such payment, by the aggregate of the DLT deductions made from those payments.</p>
	<p>	<i>Amount of DLT deduction where specific deduction notified</i></p>
	<p>6.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph 8 below, if a payment of consideration falls to be made in respect of a material disposal after the time at which an acquiring authority receive a notification under paragraph 3 above of the amount of the specific deduction applicable to that disposal, the acquiring authority shall deduct from that payment a DLT deduction equal to the specific deduction applicable to the disposal, less the amount of the DLT deduction deducted from any previous payment of consideration made in respect of that disposal or, where there has been more than one such previous payment, less the aggregate amount of the DLT deductions made from those payments.</p>
	<p>(2) Subject to paragraphs 7 and 8 below, where a payment of consideration which falls to be made as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above is neither the only nor the last payment of consideration which falls to be made in respect of the material disposal concerned, there shall be determined, as at the time immediately before the payment is made,—
	<ol>
	<li>the total amount of consideration which remains to be paid in respect of the disposal, and</li>
	<li>the amount of the specific deduction applicable to the disposal, less the amount of the DLT deduction deducted from any previous payment of consideration made in respect of that disposal or, where there has been more than one such previous payment, less the aggregate amount of the DLT deductions made from those payments,</li></ol>
and the amount of the DLT deduction to be made from that payment of consideration shall be equal to that proportion of the amount referred to in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) above which the amount of that payment bears to the total amount referred to in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) above.</p>
	<p>(3) In any case where, apart from this sub-paragraph, the amount of the DLT deduction to be made by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) or sub-paragraph (2) above from a payment of consideration would exceed the amount of that payment, that DLT deduction shall be of an amount equal to the amount of that payment.</p>
	<p>(4) Any reference in this paragraph to the amount of any consideration or of any payment of consideration is a reference to the amount of that consideration or payment before any DLT deduction is made from it, but exclusive of any interest payable by the acquiring authority.</p>
	<p>(5) If an acquiring authority receives more than one notification under paragraph 3 above of the amount of the specific deduction applicable to a material disposal, the later or latest notification
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1303">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1369</span>
shall be taken to supersede any earlier notification; but the receipt of a second or subsequent notification shall not require the re-determination of the amount of the DLT deduction applicable to a payment of consideration made before the receipt of that notification.</p>
	<p>	<i>Advance payments of compensation</i></p>
	<p>7.—(1) In their application to a payment of consideration which consists of such a payment as is referred to in paragraph 1(5)(	<i>a</i>) above (in this paragraph referred to as an "advance payment of compensation") paragraphs 5 and 6 above shall have effect subject to the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
	<p>(2) In relation to an advance payment of compensation made in connection with a material disposal, any reference in paragraph 5 above or in the following provisions of this paragraph to the consideration for that material disposal shall be construed as a reference to an amount equal to ten-ninths of the amount of that advance payment.</p>
	<p>(3) In a case where the relevant payment, within the meaning of paragraph 5 above, is an advance payment of compensation, the formula deduction applicable to that advance payment shall be calculated as if the reference in sub-paragraphs (4)(	<i>a</i>) and (6)(	<i>a</i>) of that paragraph to the amount of the relevant payment were a reference to the amount of the consideration for the material disposal.</p>
	<p>(4) If, apart from this sub-paragraph, the DLT deduction to be made from an advance payment of compensation would, by virtue of paragraph 5(1) above, be a formula deduction, then—
	<ol>
	<li>if the formula deduction applicable to the advance payment does not exceed 10 per cent. of the consideration for the material disposal concerned, no DLT deduction shall be made by virtue of that paragraph from that advance payment; and</li>
	<li>in any other case the DLT deduction to be made by virtue of paragraph 5(1) above from the advance payment shall be the amount by which the formula deduction applicable to that advance payment exceeds 10 per cent. of the consideration for the material disposal concerned.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(5) In its application to an advance payment of compensation, paragraph 6 above shall have effect with the omission of sub-paragraph (2).</p>
	<p>	<i>DLT deduction not to exceed balance remaining after discharge of pre-12th September 1974 mortgage or charge</i></p>
	<p>8.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) below, in the case of a material disposal where—
	<ol>
	<li>immediately before the time of the transfer of the relevant interest to the acquiring authority (in this paragraph referred to as "the material time") a mortgage or charge entered into on or before 12th September 1974 subsists in relevant land; and</li>
	<li>by virtue of the material disposal the mortgage or charge is to be discharged at or before the material time and falls to be so discharged, in whole or in part, out of the consideration for that disposal; and</li>
	<li>the cost of redemption of the mortgage or charge exceeds the amount which would remain after deducting from the consideration for the disposal the amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be the DLT deduction.</li></ol>
the DLT deduction relevant to the material disposal shall be the amount (if any) by which the con-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1370</span>
sideration for that disposal exceeds the cost of redemption of the mortgage or charge.</p>
	<p>(2) In this paragraph "the relevant land" means the land in which the relevant interest subsists immediately after its transfer to the acquiring authority, and in any case where the mortgage or charge referred to in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of sub-paragraph (1) above subsists in other land, as well as the relevant land,—
	<ol>
	<li>the references in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of that sub-paragraph to the discharge of the mortgage or charge shall be construed as references to the discharge of the mortgage or charge so far as it relates to the relevant land; and</li>
	<li>the reference in paragrpah (	<i>c</i>) of that sub-paragraph to the cost of redemption of the mortgage or charge shall be construed as a reference to that proportion of that cost which is properly attributable to the relevant land.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(3) No DLT deduction shall be made from the consideration for the material disposal if, by reference to a mortgage or charge entered into on or before 12th September 1974, that consideration is agreed or determined under any of the following enactments,—
	<ol>
	<li>section 15(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 101 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 or, in Northern Ireland, section 110 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (debt secured on land exceeds the value of the land); or</li>
	<li>section 16(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 103 of the Land Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 or, in Northern Ireland, section 11 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (acquisition of part of land subject to mortgage or charge).</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(4) Nothing in this paragraph shall impose on an adquiring authority an obligation to make a DLT deduction limited to the amount referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above unless, before the material time,—
	<ol>
	<li>the existence of the mortgage or charge referred to in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of that subparagraph is brought to the notice of the acquiring authority; and</li>
	<li>the creditor under the mortgage or charge informs the acquiring authority of the cost of redemption of the mortgage or charge and furnishes to them any other information which the authority might reasonably require from him for the purpose of determining the amount of that DLT deduction.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(5) In this paragraph "mortgage or charge" means an interest falling within paragraph (	<i>a</i>) or paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of subsection (2) of section 45 of this Act and for the purposes of this paragraph—
	<ol>
	<li>a mortgage or charge shall be taken to be entered into on or before 12th September 1974 if it was entered into after that date in pursuance of an offer which was accepted before that date; and</li>
	<li>the cost of redemption of a mortgage or charge means the amount required to discharge the mortgage or charge at the date of the material disposal, less the amount of the principal of any further advance made after 12th September 1974, otherwise than in pursuance of such an

offer as is referred to in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) above. </li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(6) Any question arising under sub-paragraph (2)(	<i>b</i>) above as to the proportion of the cost of redemption of a mortgage or charge which is properly attributable to any land shall be determined by agreement between the chargeable person, the creditor under the mortgage or charge and the acquiring authority or, in default of agreement, by the Lands Tribunal, the Lands Tribunal for Scotland or the Lands Tribunal for Northern Ireland, according to the location of the land.</p>
	<p>	<i>Compulsory purchase: sums paid into court or deposited</i></p>
	<p>9.—(1) In the application of section 9 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (refusal to convey, failure to make title, etc.) to a material disposal in connection with which the acquiring authority are required to make a deduction under section 38 of this Act,—
	<ol>
	<li>any reference in the said section 9 to the compensation agreed or awarded to be paid or the compensation payable in respect of the relevant interest shall be construed as a reference to the amount of the compensation so agreed or awarded less the amount of the deduction required to be made therefrom under section 38 of this Act; and</li>
	<li>the reference in subsection (1) of the said section 9 to the tender of the compensation shall be construed as including a reference to the giving of an undertaking to furnish an appropriate statement under subsecttion (4) of section 38 of this Act.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above has effect in relation to an amount of compensation paid into court under section 9(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 38 of this Act and the preceding provisions of this Schedule shall apply as if that amount were being paid direct to the chargeable person by way of consideration for the disposal.</p>
	<p>(3) Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply in relation to Scotland subject to the following modifications:—
	<ol>
	<li>for any reference to section 9 or subsection (1) of section 9 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 there shall be substituted a reference to section 75 of the Land Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845; and</li>
	<li>for any reference to compensation there shall be substituted a reference to purchase-money or compensation; and</li>
	<li>in sub-paragraph (2) above for the words "paid into court" there shall be substituted the word "deposited".</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(4) Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply in relation to Northern Ireland subject to the following modifications:—
	<ol>
	<li>for any reference to section 9 or subsection (1) of section 9 of the Compuslory Purchase Act 1965 there shall be substituted a reference to section 76 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845; and</li>
	<li>for any reference to compensation there shall be substituted a reference to purchase money or compensation; and</li>
	<li>in sub-paragraph (2) above for the words "paid into court" there shall be substituted the word "deposited".</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(5) Without prejudice to the operation of subsection (5) of section 38 of this Act, in deter-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1372</span>
mining whether the condition of a bond given under the enactment permitting entry on the giving of security has been performed, nothing in that section shall authorise the making of a deduction from any amount required to be paid into court or deposited under that enactment.</p>
	<p>(6) In sub-paragraph (5) above, "the enactment permitting entry on the giving of security" means—
	<ol>
	<li>in England and Wales, Schedule 3 to the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965;</li>
	<li>in Scotland, section 84 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845; and</li>
	<li>in Northern Ireland, section 85 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>	<i>Procedure subsequent to making of DLT deduction</i></p>
	<p>10.—(1) Where, in connection with a material disposal, the acquiring authority makes a payment of consideration from which it deducts a DLT deduction, the authority shall forthwith furnish to the Board a certificate giving the particulars contained in the statement required to be furnished under section 38(4) of this Act and such other information as may be appropriate to identify the transaction concerned.</p>
	<p>(2) If, after the receipt of a certificate under sub-paragraph (1) above, the Board notify the acquiring authority by whom the certificate was furnished that the amount of the DLT deduction in respect of the material disposal concerned exceeds the amount of development land tax for which the chargeable person is liable in respect of that disposal,—
	<ol>
	<li>the amount of the excess shall be payable by the acquiring authority to the Board; and</li>
	<li>the Board shall account to the chargeable person for the amount of the excess as an amount of development land tax paid in excess of his liability; and</li>
	<li>sections 65 to 68 and 70 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (proceedings for recovery of tax) shall have effect as if the amount of the excess were an amount of tax, within the meaning of that Act, due from the acquiring authority.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(3) In so far as the liability of the chargeable person for development land tax in respect of a material disposal exceeds the amount of the DLT deduction in respect of that disposal, the amount of the excess shall be due and payable to the Board in like manner and an amount of development land tax for which the chargeable person is liable in respect of a disposal which is not a material disposal.</p>
	<p>(4) A certificate under sub-paragraph (1) above shall be either in a form prescribed by the Board or in a form authorised by them for use in substitution for the form prescribed and containing a statement that it has been so authorised.</p>
	<p>	<i>Interest on DLT deductions made before reckonable date</i></p>
	<p>11.—(1)In any case where—
	<ol>
	<li>in connection with a material disposal the acquiring authority make a payment of consideration from which they deduct a DLT deduction, and</li>
	<li>that payment is made before the date which is the reckonable date in relation to the chargeable person's liability for development land tax in respect of that disposal,</li></ol>
the chargeable person shall be entitled to interest on the amount of that DLT deduction for the period beginning on the date on which the payment is made and ending on the reckonable date.</p>

	<p>(2) Interest to which a person is entitled under sub-paragraph (1) above shall be payable by the acquiring authority concerned and calculated at the rate which is for the time being the prescribed rate for the purposes of section 86A of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (interest on unpaid development land tax).</p>
	<p>	<i>Exclusion of provisions as to interest on unpaid tax</i></p>
	<p>12. Notwithstanding that a payment of consideration from which a DLT deduction is deducted may be made after the reckonable date, section 86A of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (interest on unpaid development land tax) shall not apply to any development land tax which a person is treated as having paid to the Board by virtue of section 38(5)(	<i>b</i>) of this Act.</p>
	<p>	<i>Inspection of books, accounts, etc.</i></p>
	<p>13. Whenever called upon to do so by an officer authorised in that behalf by the Board, an exempt body shall produce to that officer for inspection, at its principal office or place of business, all, or such as may be specified by that officer of, the books, accounts and other documents and records in the possession or under the control of that body and relating to—

	<p>Amendment (j) to Government Amendment No. 406, leave out paragraph 7.</p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>6.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal first with Amendments Nos. 401, 402 and 403. The explanation for these amendments is that Clause 38(7) introduces Schedule 7, which deals with the giving of notices and the information to and by the Board in relation to acquisitions by exempt bodies. We have been debating that matter on several amendments. These amendments and Amendment No. 406 itself give effect to an undertaking which my right hon. friend the then Paymaster-General gave on Second Reading, to consider whether it was possible to spell out in more detail the arrangements for net-of-tax arrangements in a schedule to the Bill. That is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1374</span>
what we have tried to do in Amendment No. 406.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, it is not possible to deal with all these matters in the schedule. When we have net-of-tax provisions, it may be necessary from time to time to issue Statutory Instruments to amend or to deal with particular situations, as is done under PAYE regulations. PAYE regulations are laid before Parliament to deal with specific matters which arise. These three amendments would give power to the Board to make regulations by Statutory instrument in relation to certain matters of detail in the operation of the net-of-tax arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not possible to deal with all the problems. Indeed, it is not possible to foresee some of the problems that might arise. It is the custom and convention in these matters, particularly in relation to PAYE, that regulations are issued from time to time by Statutory Instrument to deal with problems relating to the deduction of tax. Amendments Nos. 401, 402 and 403 give the Board the power to make regulations by Statutory Instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 404 and 405 are concerned with paragraph 1(4) of Schedule 7 and provide that when the time of acquisition of land is the date of conveyance, that is, where there was no previous contract, an acquiring authority may give a provisional notice of acquisition to the Board at any time after the amount of the consideration has been agreed. The object of the amendment is to extend this procedure by allowing a provisional notice of acquisition to be sent in any case where the agreed consideration exceeds 110 per cent. of the acquiring authority's estimate of current use value. It is intended that such a provisional notice would give the DLT Office and the vendor the maximum opportunity to come to an agreement on the amount of DLT deduction before the consideration is paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman criticised me for constantly referring to the ability on the part of the vendor to go off to Middlesbrough and seek speedy provisional assessment from those well trained mandarins. This amendment ensures that a provisional notice will be given in all cases, not just in the case where the acquiring authority acquires without a contract but merely through a conveyance. It is in the interests of both the vendors and acquiring authorities that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1306">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1375</span>
the DLT deduction should be an agreed amount whenever that can be arranged, and representations have been made by local authority associations that this procedure should be applied as widely as possible. Amendments Nos. 404 and 405 provide for that provisional notice to enable an agreement to be reached so that deductions can be carried out by agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 406, which is the main amendment we have been discussing, may be left for the time being, as we shall be returning to it in relation to a number of other amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 407 and 408 embody the consequential redrafting arising from paragraph 12 of Schedule 7 contained in Amendment No. 406.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We might have got the Bill right from the start. I am much obliged to my hon. Friend. Where a DLT deduction is made from a payment of consideration by an exempt body, paragraph 12 of Schedule 7 applies to except the chargeable person from liability to pay interest on the amount deducted, even though the payment was made after the reckonable date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provisions relating to interest are slightly more beneficial in respect of a person who sells to a local authority because it might be said that he was at some disadvantage in selling to a local authority as he has to suffer a net of tax deduction, whereas if he sold to a private purchaser that would not apply. Therefore, there are special provisions relating to interest in that regard, and we shall come to those on Schedule 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is therefore necessary to refer to this exception in the new Section 86A of the Taxes Management Act 1970—which is inserted by paragraph 21 of Schedule 8—which provides for interest on DLT
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1376</span>
unpaid on the reckonable date. Therefore, these amendments foreshadow and are consequential to some extent upon these different arrangements for interest which will apply, and are included in paragraph 21 of Schedule 8. This seeks to insert a new Section 86A to the Taxes Management Act 1970, which deals generally with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not following the Minister entirely in the amendments that he was putting to the Committee, and for trying to search them out. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper), who I know has read every word of the Bill from cover to cover and is well acquainted with it. Certainly he should have been enlisted to give the Minister advice during the course of preparation of the Bill, and I am grateful to him for guiding me on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendments went on to the Amendment Paper at a rather late date. It has not been easy to amend them entirely as we would wish, particularly new Schedule 7 in Amendment No. 406. But at the same time we on the Conservative side of the Committee understood the purport of Amendment No. 406. Those which the Minister has now moved are, I understand, tidying up amendments to the amendments which he has previously put on the Amendment Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have only one important question to ask, I think, and this is on Amendment No. 403: the power of the Board to make regulations. The Minister will recollect that on Second Reading we made inquiries as to what was intended by the regulations which the Board would be empowered to make under the Bill as it stands. This is contained in subsection (6) of Clause 38. We were fearful lest those regulations might be too onerous on the vendor of the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In accordance with the undertaking then given, we now have most of those regulations, not as regulations but as provisions in the Bill. We are very grateful for that, particularly for the way that they are set out in what I have been calling new Schedule 7. But we still have the dustbin, as it were, sweeping—I cannot say into the dustbin of the palace of Middlesbrough—any possible further matters which ought to have been dealt with into the remaining powers of the Board, in this case to tidy things up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1307">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1377</span>
The Bill as I read it—and I may have missed it—has no provision for the making of regulations. Normally one looks towards the end of a Bill of this sort and somewhere around the interpretation clause one finds a general power for regulations. It may well be that the statutory instrument bringing those regulations into effect under Amendment No. 403 is defined in another statute, such as the Taxes Management Act, which is read into the Bill—I do not know. What I want to know is whether those regulations made by statutory instrument would have any parly procedure. To say that regulations are made merely by statutory instrument means that they do not need to be laid before Parliament, let alone be subject to annulment procedure or affirmative resolution. As these—although I can see the intention— are merely sweeping-up regulations, Amendment No. 403 as worded could go wide. We know how wide incidental or consequential amendments can be, and there should be some parly procedure for them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that does not already apply, by some other statute being read into the Bill, I hope that we shall have something specific in the Bill to say that those statutory instruments shall be subject to some parly procedure. I always ask for affirmative approval, because, as the procedure of Parliament now goes, negative procedure means nothing, for Prayers are never brought on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will recognise that Clause 38(7) provides that such a statutory instrument shall be subject to the negative procedure. It says that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the Board may by regulations made by statutory instrument make provision …"</p></blockquote>
and that the last three lines of the subsection set out what he does not like—that:
	<br><blockquote><p>"a statutory instrument … shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the Commons House of Parliament."</p></blockquote>
As I think I heard him say just now, in these cases I should not have thought that the negative procedure was undesirable. I agree with him entirely that in most cases it is better to do it by affirmative resolution, but in these cases, since many of the matters will be technical, the negative procedure should be sufficient. However, parly procedure is provided under Clause 38(7).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1378</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I deal with that point at once? The Minister is probably right in saying that the negative procedure is right in this case, because it is a matter of tidying up the details of provisions in a Bill. I should like to look at it again to see, when we have considered the whole of Schedule 7, to what extent amendments may be necessary from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not observe at once that there are two amendments at the end of this group in the names of my hon. Friends and myself—No. 446 and Amendment (	<i>j</i>) to the Minister's Amendment No. 406. Amendment No. 446 comes in Schedule 7, but in the old Schedule 7— that part of the Schedule which remains in the Bill in paragraph 1. That amendment seeks to deal with the complicated point which is already in the schedule, and to add at the end of the paragraph the words on the Amendment Paper. I am not sure whether the Minister is prepared to accept this reasonable addition to the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other point is of more substance. It is our Amendment (	<i>j</i>) to the Minister's Amendment No. 406. It seeks to leave out paragraph 7 of the new Schedule 7, which deals with advance payments of compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Advance payments of compensation originated in the desire to provide money to the vendor of property being compulsorily purchased from him so that he might rehabilitate himself in other premises. Normally, this applies to residences, but it applies very much to commercial properties in city centre developments, whether they be small factories, shops, or offices. But frequently, while discussions are going on about the amount of compensation, the vendor, being compulsorily forced out of his property, is searching for another property and can clinch a bargain for another property only if he has the money in hand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That was the basis of the introduction of the 90 per cent. The history of it, as I am sure the Minister knows, is that in road construction and road widening the old Ministry of Transport introduced the practice of paying 90 per cent. in order to get on with the job. The Ministry found that, from a practical point of view, it eased the process of constructing the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1308">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1379</span>
If it could please the compelled vendor by paying 90 per cent. of the compensation money, he could move quickly and let construction of the road go ahead. This proved so satisfactory to the Ministry of Transport that it was introduced into our law. Indeed, it has worked very satisfactorily.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But now, under this deduction procedure, the vendor will not get his 90 per cent. If a large deduction is to be made, the whole of the point of advance payments of compensation is absolutely purposeless. The money will not be in hand even if the advance payment is made in accordance with the schedule, because there will be a large deduction from that and the unfortunate vendor will not have sufficient money with which to rehabilitate himself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find the corollary to this procedure extremely disappointing. I suppose it is a necessary part of it, once one accepts that there are to be these deductions, that the needs of the vendor at that moment are not to be considered, and that the tax must be taken at once and not by assessment and payment in the normal way. If one accepts that, the whole procedure of advance payments is purposeless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can assure the Minister that compulsory purchase will not go through smoothly in future if this procedure is applied, as it applied done in the past under the 90 per cent. payments scheme. By our amendment (	<i>j</i>) to the Minister's Amendment No. 406, I am registering my extreme disappointment that advance payments of compensation are to be damaged in this way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall deal with the question of advance payments of compensation. I do not agree entirely with the right hon. Gentleman, but for the record I shall try to explain how it is envisaged that paragraph 7 will operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As he will appreciate, paragraph 7 applies to determine the amount of the DLT deduction from the advance payment. If the formula deduction under paragraph 5 which is appropriate to the full amount of the agreed or estimated compensation would not exceed an amount equal to 10 per cent. of the compensation, the 90 per cent. advance payment is to be paid in that case without any DLT deduction. If the formula deduction would exceed an amount equal to 10 per cent. of the compensation, the formula
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1380</span>
deduction would be abated by that amount and deducted from the 90 per cent. advance. If a specific deduction under paragraph 6 has been authorised by the Development Land Tax Office, that amount is to be deducted from the 90 per cent. advance payment. As a result, the vendor is deemed to have received, as an advance payment, 90 per cent. of the agreed compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the position is as difficult as the right hon. Gentleman suggested, although in the general review of compulsory purchase, when looking at Schedule 7 in relation to compulsory purchase we shall look at any effects it may have to see whether there is hardship and whether we can do anything about it. I recognise that when we deal with compulsory purchase we are in a slightly different situation. It may be that the provisions of Schedule 7 do not always meet that kind of situation as they do when there is agreement between the local authority and the vendor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the position is as bad as the right hon. Member suggests, but we shall look at it again to ensure that there is no hardship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a long debate on the amendments, and I do not wish to deal in detail with anything that we have gone over before. To a great extent, the Minister has met us on a number of possible improvements to the clause, but, unfortunately, we have been improving his system, with which we disagree. This is one of the difficulties of an Opposition. If we had sat back on

Clause 38, saying "Very well, do it yourselves and never mind about any more amendments to it. If you put any amendments down we will not argue them. We will not put any amendments down ourselves. You can stew in your own juice in this procedure", we might have been criticised for doing that, but, at the same time, I feel unhappy even about undertakings from the Minister to improve the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I entirely dislike the procedure, even with the improvements we hope to get at a later stage. The procedure by way of deduction of DLT will cause a great deal of hardship, and bitterness between acquiring authorities and vendors. It will cause delay and excessive expense to every vendor because the sort of inquiries that will have to be made before the vendor's solicitor can advise him to go on will be enormous. This applies to all the arrangements under Clause 38. It is the Government's hope that in due course every transaction will proceed under Clause 38, that purchase will always be by a public authority, and we shall no longer have private transactions in land and buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I express my sincere gratitude to the Minister for the way he has listened to our complaints on this score, and has, on more than one occasion said that he is prepared to look at it and improve his own procedure, we still object wholly to that procedure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>the more I came to share my right hon. Friend's grave anxieties about the implications of the working of this clause in the future. I shall not repeat what he has said, but I wish to revert for a moment to the point which we discussed at some length about the position of mortgagees. I cannot believe that the Minister will want his last remarks on that subject to remain on the record as the latest indication of Government thinking—that lenders should consider that there may be deductions of up to 80 per cent. made, and that they must make their decisions in that light.</p>
	<p>It is bad enough having the provisions as they are in the Bill. The consequences of that could be far reaching. The possibility of substantial DLT deductions against the interests of mortgagees is, I think, more serious than the Government have recognised, in spite of the Minister's earlier remarks. It is a serious step to reduce substantially the potential security value of the main item of security which most companies possess. The effect on their future fund-raising, and particularly on mortgages, when 80 per cent. is not expected to be the highest rate—we are due to have a 100 per cent. rate—could be very damaging. I shall not stress the point any more, except to say that if we were disappointed in our sense of encouragement at the Minister's earlier realism, he may have caused considerable harm by his subsequent comments.</p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although this looks a formidable list, I can put the point briefly. Throughout the original schedule, and throughout the amendments to the original schedule—what we call new Schedule 7 on the Paper—the acquiring authority has to give certain notices to the Board. There is no requirement for the acquiring authority to give any copy of those notices to the vendor. The vendor is deeply concerned as to what is going on between the acquiring authority and those who will assess him for tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What happens under the Bill as drafted is that somebody gives the Board of Inland Revenue information on which the vendor will be assessed to tax. I see no reason why the acquiring authority should not be obliged to give copies of those notices to the vendor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
6.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go through the details of all the notices, but I assure the Committee that where these notices are given they will deeply affect the vendor. He should be given a chance to make his comments upon them, as well as to record what is going on, so that he knows how his
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1384</span>
assessment is being made. We want the copy notices to be sent to the vendor as well as to the Board which will assess him to tax.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The intention behind these amendments is that the vendor should be given notices which would go to the Board from the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 438, as I read it, does not exactly follow that principle. It would allow the vendor to give to the Board the notice which the acquiring authority is obliged or allowed to give to the Board under Schedule 7. I do not think that I could agree to that amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 439, 441 and 443 would, as the right hon. Gentleman says, oblige the acquiring authority to send a copy to the vendor as well as to the Board of any notice of acquisition, notice of advance payment or notice correcting information previously given by the acquiring authority. In other words, the three amendments would require to be sent to the vendor copies of notices submitted by the acquiring authority to the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree entirely with the right hon. Gentleman. It is only right that the vendor should have those notices, and I am prepared to recommend that an amendment be tabled on Report to incorporate the principle of those amendments. There are certain matters—not defects—which should be considered. Amendments will be tabled on Report to incorporate the principle of Amendments Nos. 439, 441 and 443, but not Amendment No. 438, which we cannot accept because it goes the other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments (	<i>a</i>), (	<i>c</i>) and (	<i>d</i>) to my Amendment No. 406 would require the Board to send to the vendor as well as to the acquiring authority particulars of any assessment to DLT and to notify him, as well as the acquiring authority, that no DLT deduction should be made or of the amount of a specific deduction to be made from a payment of compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unnecessary to furnish the vendor with the particulars required by paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 7—that is Amendment (	<i>c</i>)—since these relate to matters already within the knowledge of the person making the disposal. The notice of assessment will have been sent to him, and he will know whether the amount
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1311">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1385</span>
charged has been agreed or finally determined or whether an amount has been agreed as not in dispute. To send him a copy of the particulars supplied to the acquiring authority would therefore be wasteful duplication. I am sure that hon. Gentlemen, especially the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), would not wish us to engage in wasteful duplication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other two amendments would require the Board to notify the person making the disposal either when it notifies the acquiring authority that there appears to be no liability to DLT and that no DLT deduction shall be made from the consideration or when it notifies the acquiring authority of a specific DLT deduction to be made under paragraph 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, these amendments are unnecessary. First, the vendor will know when he receives the consideration that the acquiring authority is not making a DLT deduction. Second, he will receive a certificate of the DLT deduction. So these three amendments would create more work administratively without improving the procedures and without giving the taxpayer any greater advantage than he has already.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 439, 441 and 443 I am prepared to accept in principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister for accepting the three amendments to which he referred. It is right that the vendor should have these notices so that he knows what is going on between the acquiring authority and the Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the three amendments to his amendment to Schedule 7, I appreciate that these were matters which normally would reach the vendor direct from the Board. But then the Board gives a notice to the acquiring authority on which the acquiring authority will act. I thought it reasonable enough that the vendor should be able to see that the acquiring authority was given the same information as was given to the vendor. If the wrong assessment is sent to the acquiring authority, there will be some confusion over what amount should be deducted. That was the reason for their being put on Paper.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having drawn attention to that, I hope that the Board will take care to see that it give the same information to both. Things could only go wrong if a stupid administrative mistake is committed—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1386</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That would never happen in the palace of Middlesbrough. At any rate, there is a procedure dealing with administrative mistakes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the Minister for explaining what I intended to explain on my first amendment here which I moved, because it is an important point. The whole process from the compulsory purchase order or from the agreement which will result in the conveyance of the property, and the speed with which it takes place, is dependent on the acquiring authority giving these notices. The acquiring authority can sit back and delay matters if it chooses to do so by not giving the proper notices. As far as I can see, the vendor has no way of speeding things up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With a contract for sale, there is a completion date included and the vendor can take the normal steps to enforce completion. But a compulsory purchase order can be left hanging over his head while the local authority or other acquiring authority dilly-dallies with the giving of notices. I see no reason why he should not be given some power to give those notices, instead of the local authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that it means that in that notice he will say that the local authority thinks that the current use value is £x—but why should he not say that? It might be wise to give his own current use value if the local authority does not do so. My effort to solve this problem may not be right—that he gives the notices himself—but there should be some sanction on acquiring authorities to get on with the job if the vendor wants them to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps a short paragraph could be included stating that if the vendor gives notice to the local authority to give these notices, it must do so within 14 days, or some such. It is not unusual, particularly with local authorities, for an acquiring authority to get its compulsory purchase order and leave it outstanding not for weeks, nor for months, but in some cases for years. The vendor must have power to move matters along as quickly as he might desire. If the Minister dislikes my wording in Amendment No. 438, will he consider some sanction on dilatory acquiring authorities when the vendor wants them to proceed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, having got the Minister's assurance that he agrees with three of the

This is an amendment to the original Schedule 7 on page 135 of the Bill, to leave out subparagraph (7) of paragraph 1. It is much on the same lines as that which we have already discussed on the giving of notice. Subparagraph (7) is a rather elaborate provision about giving notice when there is a variation. As this may be dealt with sufficiently on the previous amendments, the principle of which the Minister has accepted, I shall not press the amendment today. If the Minister has any comment or kind words to say about it, I shall be glad to hear them.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 444, in page 135, line 49, leave out 'require' and insert 'prescribe'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely ask here that there should be some formality about an action by the Board. This amendment occurs in sub-paragraph (9) of paragraph 1, which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"A notice of acquisition, provisional notice of acquisition or notice of advance payment shall contain such information as the Board may reasonably require for the purposes of this Act."</p></blockquote>
That means that, if a notice is given and the Board says "That notice is not sufficient. We require this further information", there will be further delay. I am asking that the Board should prescribe in advance what should be in these notices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

We are starting on a new procedure and it is right that sometimes that procedure should be left flexible. A procedure of this sort, however, must have forms laid down for the giving of these notices. People coming to this procedure anew, will want to be able to do it quickly and not have to sit down, wade through 13 paragraphs in Schedule 7—as there would be, were Amendment No. 406 to be carried—and wade through Clause 38 to try to find out what sort of information they should give to the Board—whether it is the local authority or any other person concerned having to give notices. So let us have the notices prescribed—and there is nothing unusual about this—in statutory instruments so that everyone will know what form to use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister does not want the notices prescribed in statutory instruments, let us have them prescribed in "extra statutory instruments" or even in the practice notes. But we must not leave it, as it is in the Bill, that the Board can merely require a form without anybody knowing beforehand what form they must complete.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would provide for the information to be contained in a notice of aqcuisition and in the other notices to be prescribed by the Board. I hope I can satisfy the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) that they are, in fact, prescribed in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the right hon. Gentleman looks at subparagraphs (1), (4) and (5) of paragraph 1, which deal with the notices, he will see that the legislation provides for the notices to be in a prescribed form.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would provide for this information to be prescribed by the Board. As the forms for supplying the information will themselves be prescribed by the Board, separate prescription of the information they are to contain is, I am advised, inappropriate and unnecessary. The subparagraph as drafted ensures that the information will be only such as the Board may reasonably require for the purposes of the Act. I do not know whether that entirely satisfied the right hon. Gentleman. I see that he shakes his head. My advice is that the notices are prescribed for that reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let us say that they are prescribed and leave it at that, and cut out subparagraph (9) altogether. If they are sufficiently prescribed in the rest of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1390</span>
schedule, let us leave it at that. But here we are told that the Board may require any other information. This leaves the unfortunate person giving the notice in grave doubt as to what will be required and also obliges him to try to think out the form of notice and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to give this some further consideration. I would have thought that either we should re-draft subparagraph (9) or leave it out altogether and let it rest on his new Schedule 7.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to look at the matter again.

	<li>the Board receive a notice under paragraph 1 above relating to a material disposal, and</li>
	<li>it appears to them that that disposal does not or will not give rise to any liability for development land tax, and</li>

the Board may, with the agreement of the person by whom the material disposal is or is to be made, notify the acquiring authority of the amount of the specific deduction which, in accordance with paragraph 4(5) below, is applicable to the material disposal.</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Notification of specific deduction</i></p>
	<p>4.—(1) If, by virtue of the receipt of a notice of acquisition and the making of an assessment to development land tax (in this paragraph referred to as "the relevant assessment") the Board are under the obligation to furnish particulars of the relevant assessment as mentioned in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of sub-paragraph (1) of paragraph 3 above, the obligation to notify the acquiring authority as mentioned in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of that subparagraph shall arise in any case where, at the time the particulars of the relevant assessment are so furnished, any of the conditions in sub-paragraph (2) below is fulfilled.</p>
	<p>(2) The conditions referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above are—
	<ol>
	<li>that the liability for development land tax in respect of the material disposal has been agreed or determined in the amount charged by the relevant assessment;</li>
	<li>that the period of thirty days beginning on the date of issue of the notice of the relevant assessment has expired without a notice of appeal having been given against the relevant assessment;</li>
	<li>that notice of appeal has been given against the relevant assessment and an amount of development land tax has become due and payable under the Taxes Management Act 1970; and</li>
	<li>that notice of appeal has been given against the relevant assessment but no amount of development land tax has become due and payable under the Taxes Management Act 1970 and the amount of tax charged by the relevant assessment is less than the amount of the formula deduction, within the meaning of paragraph 5 below, which would be applicable to a payment of the whole of the consideration for the material disposal.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(3) Where the obligation of the Board to notify the acquiring authority of the amount of the specific deduction applicable to the material disposal arises by reason of the fulfilment of any condition in sub-paragraph (2) above, then—
	<ol>
	<li>if the condition fulfilled is that in paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of that sub-paragraph, the amount of the specific deduction shall be equal to the amount of tax referred to in that paragraph; and</li>
	<li>in any other case, the amount of the specific deduction shall be equal to the amount of tax charged by the relevant assessment.</li>

	<p>(4) Where sub-paragraph (4) of paragraph 3 above applies, the Board shall be under the obligation specified in sub-paragraph (1)(	<i>b</i>) of that paragraph and in such a case the amount of the specific deduction applicable to the material disposal shall be equal to the amount of development land tax which, taking account of the variation referred to in subparagraph (4) of that paragraph, is charged by the assessment concerned or, as the case may be, has become due and payable under the Taxes Management Act 1970.</p>
	<p>(5) In relation to the exercise by the Board of their power to notify the acquiring authority as mentioned in sub-paragraph (5) of paragraph 3 above, the amount of the specific deduction applicable to the material disposal concerned shall be such as may be agreed between the Board and the person referred to in that sub-paragraph to represent—
	<ol>
	<li>the amount of his liability or prospective liability for development land tax in 105 respect of that material disposal; or</li>

	<p>	<i>The formula deduction</i></p>
	<p>5.—(1) Subject to paragraphs 7 and 8 below if, at a time when a payment of consideration falls to be made in respect of a material disposal to which paragraph 1(1) above applies the acquiring authority have not received—
	<ol>
	<li>a notification under paragraph 2(1) above, or</li>
	<li>a notification under paragraph 3 above stating the amount of the specific DLT deduction applicable to the disposal,</li></ol>
the acquiring authority shall deduct from that payment a DLT deduction of an amount determined in accordance with this paragraph (in the following provisions of this Schedule referred to as a "formula deduction").</p>
	<p>(2) In relation to a formula deduction "the relevant payment" means the payment of consideration from which the deduction falls to be made by virtue of subparagraph (1) above; and any reference in this paragraph to the amount of the relevant payment is a reference to the amount of that payment before the formula deduction is made, but exclusive of any interest payable by the acquiring authority.</p>
	<p>(3) If the amount of the consideration for the material disposal does not exceed the aggregate of—
	<ol>
	<li>110 per cent. of the acquiring authority's estimate of the value which, for the purposes of this Act, is the current use value of the relevant interest at the time of their acquisition, and</li>
	<li>£10,000,</li></ol>
the amount of the formula deduction shall be nil; and in relation to a material disposal the aggregate amount determined under this sub-paragraph is referred to as "the exempt amount".</p>
	<p>(4) If sub-paragraph (3) does not apply and the material disposal occurs in an interim financial year, then, subject to sub-paragraphs (5) and (8) and paragraph 7(3) below, the formula deduction shall be whichever is the less of the following amounts, namely,—
	<ol>
	<li>50 per cent. of the amount of the relevant payment; and</li>
	<li>66⅔ per cent. of the amount by which the consideration for the disposal exceeds the exempt amount.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(5) If, in a case where sub-paragraph (4) above applies, the consideration for the material disposal exceeds the exempt amount by more than £150,000, that sub-paragraph and sub-paragraph (8) below shall have effect as is for paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of sub-paragraph (4) above there were substituted the following paragraph:—
	<div class='ul'>
	<li>"(	<i>b</i>) £100,000 plus 80 per cent. of the amount by which the consideration for the disposal exceeds the aggregate of the exempt amount and £150,000".</li>
</div> <!-- ul --></p>
	<p>(6) If sub-paragraph (3) above does not apply and the material disposal occurs after 31st March 1979, then, subject to sub-paragraph (8) and paragraph 7(3) below, the formula deduction shall be whichever is the less of the following amounts, namely,—
	<ol>
	<li>the appropriate percentage of the amount of the relevant payment; and</li>
	<li>80 per cent. of the amount by which the consideration for the disposal exceeds the exempt amount.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(7) In sub-pararaph (6)(	<i>a</i>) above "the appropriate percentage" means such percentage as may be specified by the Board by regulations made by statutory instrument; and a statutory instrument containing regulations under this sub-paragraph shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of the Commons House of Parliament.</p>
	<p>(8) If, before the time at which the relevant payment falls to be made in respect of a material disposal, a previous payment of consideration has been made in respect of that disposal, then, in calculating the formula deduction, the amount determined under sub-paragraph (4)(	<i>b</i>) or, as the case may be, sub-paragraph (6)(	<i>b</i>) above shall be reduced by the amount of the DLT deduction made from that previous payment or, if there has been more than one such payment, by the aggregate of the DLT deductions made from those payments.</p>
	<p>	<i>Amount of DLT deduction where specific deduction notified</i></p>
	<p>6.—(1) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph 8 below, if a payment of consideration falls to be made in respect of a material disposal after the time at which an acquiring authority receive a notification under paragraph 3 above of the amount of the specific deduction applicable to that disposal, the acquiring authority shall deduct from that payment a DLT deduction equal to the specific deduction applicable to the disposal, less the amount of the DLT deduction deducted from any previous payment of consideration made in respect of that disposal or, where there has been more than one such previous payment, less the aggregate amount of the DLT deductions made from those payments.</p>
	<p>(2) Subject to paragraphs 7 and 8 below, where a payment of consideration which falls to be made as mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) above is neither the only nor the last payment of consideration which falls to be made in respect of the material disposal concerned, there shall be determined, as at the time immediately before the payment is made,—
	<ol>
	<li>the total amount of consideration which remains to be paid in respect of the disposal, and</li>
	<li>the amount of the specific deduction applicable to the disposal, less the amount of the DLT deduction deducted from any previous payment of consideration made in respect of that disposal or, where there has been more than one such previous payment, less the aggregate amount of the DLT deductions made from those payments,</li></ol>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1395</span>
and the amount of the DLT deduction to be made from that payment of consideration shall be equal to that proportion of the amount referred to in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) above which the amount of that payment bears to the total amount referred to in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) above.</p>
	<p>(3) In any case where, apart from this sub-paragraph, the amount of the DLT deduction to be made by virtue of sub-paragraph (1) or sub-paragraph (2) above from a payment of consideration would exceed the amount of that payment, that DLT deduction shall be of an amount equal to the amount of that payment.</p>
	<p>(4) Any reference in this paragraph to the amount of any consideration or of any payment of consideration is a reference to the amount of that consideration or payment before any DLT deduction is made from it, but exclusive of any interest payable by the acquiring authority.</p>
	<p>(5) If an acquiring authority receives more than one notification under paragraph 3 above of the amount of the specific deduction applicable to a material disposal, the later or latest notification shall be taken to supersede any earlier notification; but the receipt of a second or subsequent notification shall not require the re-determination of the amount of the DLT deduction applicable to a payment of consideration made before the receipt of that notification.</p>
	<p>	<i>Advance payments of compensation</i></p>
	<p>7.—(1) In their application to a payment of consideration which consists of such a payment as is referred to in paragraph 1(5)(a) above (in this paragraph referred to as an "advance payment of compensation") paragraphs 5 and 6 above shall have effect subject to the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
	<p>(2) In relation to an advance payment of compensation made in connection with a material disposal, any reference in paragraph 5 above or in the following provisions of this paragraph to the consideration for that material disposal shall be construed as a reference to an amount equal to ten-ninths of the amount of that advance payment.</p>
	<p>(3) In a case where the relevant payment, within the meaning of paragraph 5 above, is an advance payment of compensation, the formula deduction applicable to that advance payment shall be calculated as if the reference in sub-paragraphs (4)(	<i>a</i>) and (6)(	<i>a</i>) of that paragraph to the amount of the relevant payment were a reference to the amount of the consideration for the material disposal.</p>
	<p>(4) If, apart from this sub-paragraph, the DLT deduction to be made from an advance payment of compensation would, by virtue of paragraph 5(1) above, be a formula deduction, then—
	<ol>
	<li>if the formula deduction applicable to the advance payment does not exceed 10 per cent. of the consideration for the material disposal concerned, no DLT deduction shall be made by virtue of that paragraph from that advance payment; and</li>
	<li>in any other case the DLT deduction to be made by virtue of paragraph 5(1) above from the advance payment shall be the amount by which the formula deduction applicable to that advance payment exceeds 10 per cent. of the consideration for the material disposal concerned.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(5) In its application to an advance payment of compensation, paragraph 6 above shall have effect with the omission of sub-paragraph (2).</p>
	<p>	<i>DLT deduction not to exceed balance remaining after discharge of pre-12th September</i> 1974 	<i>mortgage or charge</i></p>
	<p>8.—(1) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) below, in the case of a material disposal where—
	<ol>
	<li>immediately before the time of the transfer of the relevant interest to the acquiring authority (in this paragraph referred to as "the material time") a mortgage or charge entered into on or before 12th September 1974 subsists in relevant land; and</li>
	<li>by virtue of the material disposal the mortgage or charge is to be discharged at or before the material time and falls to be so discharged, in whole or in part, out of the consideration for that disposal; and</li>
	<li>the cost of redemption of the mortgage or charge exceeds the amount which would remain after deducting from the consideration for the disposal the amount which, apart from this paragraph, would be the DLT deduction.</li></ol>
the DLT deduction relevant to the material disposal shall be the amount (if any) by which the consideration for that disposal exceeds the cost of redemption of the mortgage or charge.</p>
	<p>(2) In this paragraph "the relevant land" means the land in which the relevant interest subsists immediately after its transfer to the acquiring authority, and in any case where the mortgage or charge referred to in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of sub-paragraph (1) above subsists in other land, as well as the relevant land,—
	<ol>
	<li>the references in paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of that sub-paragraph to the discharge of the 250 mortgage or charge shall be construed as references to the discharge of the mortgage or charge so far as it relates to the relevnt land; and</li>
	<li>the reference in paragraph (	<i>c</i>) of that sub-paragraph to the cost of redemption of the mortgage or charge shall be construed as a reference to that proportion of that cost which is properly attributable to the relevant land.</li>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1397</span>
	<p>(3) No DLT deduction shall be made from the consideration for the material disposal if, by reference to a mortgage or charge entered into on or before 12th September 1974, that consideration is agreed or determined under any of the following enactments,—
	<ol>
	<li>section 15(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 101 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 or, in Northern Ireland, section 110 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (debt secured on land exceeds the value of the land); or</li>
	<li>section 16(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 103 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 or, in Northern Ireland, section 112 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation Act 1845 (acquisition of part of land subject to mortgage or charge).</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(4) Nothing in this paragraph shall impose on an acquiring authority an obligation to make a DLT deduction limited to the amount referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above unless, before the material time,—
	<ol>
	<li>the existence of the mortgage or charge referred to in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of that sub-paragraph is brought to the notice of the acquiring authority; and</li>
	<li>the creditor under the mortgage or charge informs the acquiring authority of the cost of redemption of the mortgage or charge and furnishes to them any other information which the authority might reasonably require from him for the purpose of determining the amount of that DLT deduction.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(5) In this paragraph "mortgage or charge" means an interest falling within paragraph (	<i>a</i>) or paragraph (	<i>b</i>) of subsection (2) of section 45 of this Act and for the purposes of this paragraph—
	<ol>
	<li>a mortgage or charge shall be taken to be entered into on or before 12th September 1974 if it was entered into after that date in pursuance of an offer which was 280 accepted before that date; and</li>
	<li>the cost of redemption of a mortgage or charge means the amount required to discharge the mortgage or charge at the date of the material disposal, less the amount of the principal of any further advance made after 12th September 1974, otherwise than in pursuance of such an offer as is referred to in paragraph (	<i>a</i>) above.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(6) Any question arising under sub-paragraph (2)(b) above as to the proportion of the cost of redemption of a mortgage or charge which is properly attributable to any land shall be determined by agreement between the chargeable person, the creditor under the mortgage or charge and the acquiring authority or, in default of agreement, by the Lands Tribunal, the Lands Tribunal for Scotland or the Lands Tribunal for Northern Ireland, according to the location of the land.</p>
	<p>	<i>Compulsory purchase: sums paid into court or deposited</i></p>
	<p>9.—(1) In the application of section 9 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 (refusal to convey, failure to make title, etc.) to a material disposal in connection with which the acquiring authority are required to make a deduction under section 38 of this Act,—
	<ol>
	<li>any reference in the said section 9 to the compensation agreed or awarded to be paid or the compensation payable in respect of the relevant interest shall be construed as a reference to the amount of the compensation so agreed or awarded less the amount of the deduction required to be made therefrom under section 38 of this 300 Act; and</li>
	<li>the reference in subsection (1) of the said section 9 to the tender of the compensation shall be construed as including a reference to the giving of an undertaking to furnish an appropriate statement under subsection (4) of section 38 of this Act.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above has effect in relation to an amount of compensation paid into court under section 9(1) of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965, section 38 of this Act and the preceding provisions of this Schedule shall apply as if that amount were being paid direct to the chargeable person by way of consideration for the disposal.</p>
	<p>(3) Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply in relation to Scotland subject to the following modifications:—
	<ol>
	<li>for any reference to section 9 or subsection (1) of section 9 of the Compulsory Purchase Act 1965 there shall be substituted a reference to section 75 of the Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845; and</li>
	<li>for any reference to compensation there shall be substituted a reference to purchase-money or compensation; and</li>
	<li>in sub-paragraph (2) above for the words "paid into court" there shall be substituted the word "deposited".</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(4) Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply in relation to Northern Ireland subject to the following modifications:—

	<li>in sub-paragraph (2) above for the words "paid into court" there shall be 325 substituted the word "deposited".</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(5) Without prejudice to the operation of subsection (5) of section 38 of this Act, in determining whether the condition of a bond given under the enactment permitting entry on the giving of security has been performed, nothing in that section shall authorise the

	<p>	<i>Procedure subsequent to making of DLT deduction</i></p>
	<p>10.—(1) Where, in connection with a material disposal, the acquiring authority makes a payment of consideration from which it deducts a DLT deduction, the authority shall forthwith furnish to the Board a certificate giving the particulars contained in the statement required to be furnished under section 38(4) of this Act and such other information as may be appropriate to identify the transaction concerned.</p>
	<p>(2) If, after the receipt of a certificate under sub-paragraph (1) above, the Board notify the acquiring authority by whom the certificate was furnished that the amount of the DLT deduction in respect of the material disposal concerned exceeds the amount of development land tax for which the chargeable person is liable in respect of that disposal,—
	<ol>
	<li>the amount of the excess shall be payable by the acquiring authority to the Board; and</li>
	<li>the Board shall account to the chargeable person for the amount of the excess as an amount of development land tax paid in excess of his liability; and</li>
	<li>sections 65 to 68 and 70 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (proceedings for recovery of tax) shall have effect as if the amount of the excess were an amount of tax, within the meaning of that Act, due from the acquiring authority.</li>
</ol></p>
	<p>(3) In so far as the liability of the chargeable person for development land tax in respect of a material disposal exceeds the amount of the DLT deduction in respect of that disposal, the amount of the excess shall be due and payable to the Board in like manner an amount of development land tax for which the chargeable person is liable in respect of a disposal which is not a material disposal.</p>
	<p>(4) A certificate under sub-paragraph (1) above shall be either in a form prescribed by 360 the Board or in a form authorised by them for use in substitution for the form prescribed and containing a statement that it has been so authorised.</p>
	<p>	<i>Interest on DLT deductions made before reckonable date</i></p>
	<p>11.—(1) In any case where—
	<ol>
	<li>in connection with a material disposal the acquiring authority make a payment 365 of consideration from which they deduct a DLT deduction, and</li>
	<li>that payment is made before the date which is the reckonable date in relation to the chargeable person's liability for development land tax in respect of that disposal,</li></ol>
the chargeable person shall be entitled to interest on the amount of that DLT deduction for the period beginning on the date on which the payment is made and ending on the reckonable date.</p>
	<p>(2) Interest to which a person is entitled under sub-paragraph (1) above shall be payable by the acquiring authority concerned and calculated at the rate which is for the time being the prescribed rate for the purposes of section 86A of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (interest on unpaid development land tax).</p>
	<p>	<i>Exclusion of provisions as to interest on unpaid tax</i></p>
	<p>12. Notwithstanding that a payment of consideration from which a DLT deduction is deducted may be made after the reckonable date, section 86A of the Taxes Management Act 1970 (interest on unpaid development land tax) shall not apply to any development land tax which a person is treated as having paid to the Board by virtue of section 38(5)(b) of this Act.</p>
	<p>	<i>Inspection of books, accounts, etc.</i></p>
	<p>13. Whenever called upon to do so by an officer authorised in that behalf by the Board, an exempt body shall produce to that officer for inspection, at its principal office or place of business, all, or such as may be specified by that officer of, the books, accounts and other documents and records in the possession or under the control of that body and relating to—
	<ol>
	<li>amounts paid by way of consideration for material disposals by which interests in land were acquired by that body; and</li>
	<li>any DLT deductions made in connection with such material disposals'.— [	<i>Mr. Denzil Davies.</i>]</li>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1401</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment occurs in paragraph 5 of Amendment No. 406, and deals with the formula deduction. In subparagraph (4) of paragraph 5, there is the formula to apply where the previous formula in subparagraph (3) does not apply. Subparagraph (4) applies when the amount of the consideration for the material disposal exceeds the aggregate set out in subparagraph (3). If it does, then one applies the formula of
	<br><blockquote><p>"50 per cent. of the amount of the relevant payment; and 66⅔ per cent. of the amount by which the consideration of the disposal exceeds the exempt amount",</p></blockquote>
whichever is the less of those two figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment is aimed at reducing the figure of 50 per cent. of the amount of the relevant payment. First, I should say what is meant by the relevant payment. In subparagraph (2), it says that
	<br><blockquote><p>"'the relevant payment' means the payment of consideration from which the deduction falls to be made",</p></blockquote>
or which is the purchase money with frills as to its broad definition. The relevant payment is the consideration for the sale, and this paragraph to which the amendment refers says that the local authority or other public body, shall deduct either 50 per cent. of the consideration money or 66⅔ per cent. of the development value, if I may put it that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Normally I would imagine that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"66⅔ per cent. of the amount by which the consideration for the disposal exceeds the exempt amount",</p></blockquote>
would be the lesser figure. If one applies the first alternative 50 per cent. of the relevant payment, it may be a substantial amount, and to that extent may have no relationship to the amount of tax which may be payable. It will have an indirect relationship by having to be less than the
	<br><blockquote><p>"66⅔ per cent. of the amount by which the consideration for the disposal exceeds the exempt amount".</p></blockquote>
It appears an excessive amount for a deduction which the exempt authority will be obliged to make—if it happens to be the lesser amount—under this formula. Unless an amount is specified, the formula applies, and, as the Minister has said on previous amendments, these paragraphs in the new Schedule 7 are mandatory on the acquiring authority; it is left with no discretion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An authority is left with a discretion to decide what is the current use value on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1402</span>
which the specified amount may be payable, and left with a discretion here—perhaps a remote discretion—to decide by what the consideration for disposal exceeds the exempt amount, because the estimation of current use value comes into that. But if one is applying a formula whereby the 50 per cent. of the consideration for sale and purchase is taken away from the vendor just by means of the formula, not by reason of any assessment of his liability to tax, that seems very oppressive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our Amendment (h) refers to subparagraph (7) of paragraph 5, and seeks to define the appropriate percentage. This is another amount which occurs in subparagraph (6), where the deduction is either "the appropriate percentage" of the relevant payment, that is, the appropriate percentage of the consideration for the sale and purchase, or 80 per cent. of the amount by which the consideration for the disposal exceeds the exempt amount. This is when the 66⅔ per cent. does not apply, either because of the amount or the time, and one has to deal with it on the basis that the DLT is 80 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here again, my amendment seeks to put in a much smaller figure as the appropriate percentage. In this case, the appropriate percentage is something about which we are left in complete darkness. It is the percentage which is to be specified by the Board by regulations, and although they are to come before the House and be subject to the annulment procedure, we have no idea at this stage as to what may be inserted in those regulations as the appropriate percentage. Subparagraph (6) of paragraph 5 leaves us very much in the dark, and our Amendment (h) seeks to put a definite percentage on that. If it is a percentage which seems rather low, I hope that the Minister will treat it as a probing amendment to find out what he has in mind as the appropriate percentage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I treat Amendment (h) as the most important, because it is the one which will take effect when the Bill is enacted, and I think we must reduce this figure of 50 per cent. of the sale price as the possible amount that may be deducted from the consideration before it is paid to the vendor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has stated the case admirably, and I shall not
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1320">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1403</span>
repeat or vary what he has said. However, there is a point of principle here that needs further emphasis. With regard to the appropriate percentage which comes into effect for material disposals after 31st March 1979, would it not be better for that to be defined as the same percentage as occurs under subparagraph 4(	<i>a</i>), unless it is provided to be another figure by Statutory Instrument. Otherwise if by accident, indecision or dispute, or whatever it may be, on the date concerned there was no figure provided, it seems that one would have problems with the alternative in that formula. Perhaps it might say that the appropriate percentage means 50 per cent. or 10 per cent., or such other percentage as may be specified by the Board, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That ties in with a comment on page 7 of the Explanatory Note supplied by the Inland Revenue relating to Amendment No. 406:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The validity of 50 per cent. of the consideration as a suitable cut-off point would be tested in practice and may be varied by regulations made by statutory instrument under the power conferred by subsection (7) of Clause 38."</p></blockquote>
I wonder whether subsection (7) applies to both the appropriate percentage and to the 50 per cent. in subparagraph 4(a). Could I have the Minister's comments on that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another small point has just occurred to me in trying to relate Clause 38 to the DLT deduction part of Schedule 7. Under Amendment No. 398, which went through without discussion an hour or two ago a DLT deduction is defined as meaning:
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<br><blockquote><p>"the amount of the deduction made from that payment"—</p></blockquote>
that is, a payment of consideration in relation to a material disposal:
	<br><blockquote><p>"in accordance with subsection (1) above, and in relation to a material disposal in respect of which there is more than one payment of consideration the 'DLT deduction' means the aggregate of the DLT deductions made in respect of each of those payments."</p></blockquote>
We are talking about DLT deductions in paragraph 5 of Schedule 7, as amended, and I shall go forward a paragraph to illustrate what I mean. Lines 167, 168 and 169 refer to a DLT deduction equal to the specific deduction applicable to a particular disposal, and then say that it should be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"less the amount of the DLT deduction deducted from any previous payment of consideration made in respect of that disposal or, where there has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1404</span>
been more than one such previous payment, less the aggregate amount of the DLT deductions made from those payments."</p></blockquote>
I thought that the DLT deductions, when there were several parts of a payment in consideration of the same disposal, was defined by Amendment No. 398 as being the aggregate of the DLT deductions. I wonder whether this is because I have not understood its meaning or whether the wording may have gone a little astray at this point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman moved his amendment very fully and explained it fully, too. What it means ultimately is "We prefer 10 per cent. to 50 per cent." Basically, it is as simple as that. We think that the figure of 50 per cent. is better, and that 10 per cent. is too low. I can understand the right hon. Gentleman moving an amendment seeking a deduction of 10 per cent. because he objects to the full principle of net-of-tax deduction, and it follows that he would prefer a low deduction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that the figure of 50 per cent., at least initially, until we see how the legislation will operate, is fair. It is an alternative figure. It is not just 50 per cent. It is the lower of 50 per cent. or 110 per cent. of current use value—the other formula. On balance, we think that it is a fair figure. It is impossible to give 	<i>a fortiori</i> reasons as to why 50 per cent. is the correct figure. It simply seems to be a reasonable amount. But if it transpires that the figure is considered excessive or, indeed, is thought not high enough, there are powers in legislation to change it, reducing or increasing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not know how this will operate, and the Inland Revenue will keep a close eye on it to make sure that there is no great deterrent. It is in our interest that there should not be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had speeches from the Opposition expressing concern about local authorities being able to buy land net of tax and pointing out that our formula deduction proposals might inhibit local authorities from buying net of tax. We do not want that, either. The whole scheme of the Community Land Act, if I may mention that Act in this Committee, is to facilitate purchases by local authorities. We would not in any way try to inhibit local authorities from buying land. There is common ground between both sides of the Committee on that at least. We want local

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1405</span>
authorities to be able to buy land as quickly and easily as possible. I am glad that we have moved towards that consensus. I see the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) nodding in agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is he?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>8.45 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No I am not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought he was. We think that 50 per cent. is fair, but we shall keep the figure under review. As for what happens in 1979, I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman can expect me to say that the figure in 1979 will be such-and-such. That would be to pretend that we can foresee how it will operate. But we hope that over the next two or three years we can maintain the figure of 50 per cent. If it appears that it is inhibiting sales or causing difficulties, we have the power to amend by statutory instrument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) asked me a question, and I am afraid I did not understand its full purport. Rather than give a garbled answer, I shall study HANSARD and write to him on the point he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman raised the other point. He said that we could change the 50 per cent. by statutory instrument, subject to negative resolution. I confess that I had a few misgivings about this. By the negative resolution procedure we are enabling the Inland Revenue either to increase the amount of a deduction or to decrease it. I think, on balance, it is probably all right, as we said earlier. I accept that it can be done by the negative procedure, and, as the right hon. Gentleman knows better than any of us, it is often not possible to debate these matters in the House. But this, too, can be reviewed if it appears that the figure is oppressive. We think that we have arrived at the right figure, but if in the light of experience it turns out to be too high or too low, we shall amend the figure to ensure that purchases by local authorities are not prevented.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On that last point, the provision in subparagraph (7) is really taxation. It means that by statutory instrument to which only the annulment
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1406</span>
procedure applies, a figure for deduction of the amount can be altered, and perhaps a large figure used. If the Minister is not satisfied to accept my 10 per cent. in place of the figure laid down by order of the Board, I would certainly insert an amendment at a later stage to convert this to the affirmative procedure rather than the annulment procedure. This is rather different from what we were discussing earlier. If I am obliged to put down an amendment to turn this to the affirmative resolution procedure, I hope that the Minister will be able to accept it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of 50 per cent. being better than 10 per cent., the difficulty is that it relates to the total purchase price which has nothing whatever to do with the amount of DLT—when I say that it has nothing whatever to do with it, of course within that there may be realised development value— but one does not calculate the development land tax by the amount of the consideration for the sale. That is why this figure is so unfair. If it were an insignificant figure such as 10 per cent., I should not worry so much. Why does the Minister want it at all?, He already has a figure of 66⅔ per cent., which is the true amount for the calculation of DLT. Why not leave it at that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be extremely oppressive if 50 per cent. of the purchase money is to be taken away. What happens if the local authority cannot make up its mind about the calculation of the 66⅔ per cent.? Does it throw in any figure it chooses, and then say that the lesser figure is 50 per cent. of the consideration for the sale and purchase? That may happen. The Minister ought to consider cutting out any deduction by reference to the relevant payment—that is, the consideration. If he must have this formula for deduction, let it at least be based on the realised development value on which the development land tax will be calculated when we reach the assessment of it. That is my proposal. I hope that the Minister will consider it. If he can give me an assurance that he will look at it, I shall be happy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may deal with the two matters raised by the right hon. Gentleman, taking the second question first. The right hon. Gentleman may be surprised to learn that the figure of 50 per cent. is a protection to the taxpayer, because the formula calculation is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1322">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1407</span>
based on current use value. There may be cases in which the taxpayer is better off not choosing the current use value basis for computing the tax. He may have a higher cost of acquisition. To cover that situation, 50 per cent. is the lower figure to the 110 per cent. current use value figure. It is an attempt to protect the taxpayer. That is why the figure of 50 per cent. was chosen. The right hon. Gentleman and I may disagree about the figure, but if it was taken out of the legislation I suggest that that would be a retrograde step and that less protection would be afforded to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the right hon. Gentleman's second comment, I give him the assurance now in respect of changing the rate of deduction. We shall amend the Bill to provide that at least in that kind of case there will be the affirmative resolution procedure. The right hon. Gentleman will recognise that in other cases, other matters in the regulations may not be so important. Whether it is possible to have a procedure whereby, for example, in the case of increasing or decreasing the rate of deduction we have an affirmative resolution, and in other cases a negative resolution, I do not know. We shall consider the matter. But in respect of the taxation aspect, increasing or decreasing the rate of deduction, I agree that there should be an affirmative resolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister for that assurance. Certainly, half a loaf is better than none. On that basis I shall not press the matter. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment</i> (	<i>g</i>) 	<i>to the proposed amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move, as an amendment to the proposed amendment, Amendment (n), in line 266, leave out sub-paragraph (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment seeks to remove subparagraph (4) of paragraph 8 in Amendment No. 406. I think that I can best describe the sub-paragraph as a cheeky one. It really is, because it says
	<br><blockquote><p>"Nothing in this paragraph shall impose on an acquiring an obligation to make a DLT deduction limited to the amount referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above unless"—</p></blockquote>
and certain qualifications are then set down. To set out all these paragraphs about how the formula shall be calculated,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1408</span>
and to say that except in certain cases set out in sub-paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>), the acquiring authority is not bound by the formula at all, is an extraordinary provision. I hope that the Minister will reconsider this and have it removed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment would leave out paragraph 8(4) which releases an acquiring authority from the obligation to restrict the development land tax deduction in accordance with paragraph 8(1), that is, to protect the security of a mortgage entered into on or before 12th September 1974, unless the acquiring authority is informed of the existence of the mortgage and the mortgagee tells it of the amount outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are, therefore, concerned with the specific case of a pre-12th September 1974 mortgage where local authorities will not deduct tax. The paragraph specifies that if the taxpayer has that kind of mortgage, or his land is subject to that kind of mortgage, and he wants the local authority to be freed from its obligation to deduct tax, he must tell it. If he wants to claim the benefit of not being taxed at source, he must tell the authority "I have a pre-12th September 1974 mortgage".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be argued that the authority should know about that anyway because it is on the title and the mortgage is registered—whether on registered or unregistered land—because it is necessary to register a mortgage in some way or other. The mortgagee might have the deeds. He is the man with the power of sale, and he would know. It is only reasonable that if local authorities are not to deduct tax they should be told by the person who is getting the benefit of that non-deduction that a pre-12th September 1974 mortgage is in existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the purpose of the amendment. It would be unfair to expect authorities to search and decide whether the taxpayer is entitled to the benefit of non-deduction, even though in many cases they would know anyway. If the taxpayer wants a deduction he must inform the local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is changing the whole process of conveyancing. Amendment 406 proposes that a local authority should be exempt from the ordinary process of conveyancing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1409</span>
A purchaser is under an obligation to find out the title of the vendor and to examine that title. If the vendor, by fraud, does not disclose his title in full, so be it. Here the mortgagee is required to go to the local authority and inform it that he is a mortgagee. That is not an obligation in any other form of conveyancing. The title deeds will be in the possession of the mortgagee and because the local authority does not obtain the deeds from the vendor it will inquire whether there is a mortgage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is wrong to change the whole procedure of conveyancing and relieve the acquiring authority of the duty of investigating the title. The authority could sit back and say "We did not know anything about the mortgage. We did not have any information about it. The mortgagee did not come to the Town Hall and tell us that he had a mortgage on property." But he probably did not know that a CPO had been served on his mortgagor. That is turning everything upside down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said earlier that this is a cheeky measure. It exempts the local authority from the normal duties as a purchaser of property.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment proposes the deletion from the proposed amendment of two sub-paragraphs from paragraph 10(2). Paragraph 10 deals with the procedure subsequent to making a DLT deduction. Paragraph 10(2) provides that if there has been an over-deduction the vendor is entitled to the return of his money. But, unlike the privileged acquiring authority which gets its money direct, his overpayment which, on its own calculations the authority has taken from him, is not to be repaid direct to the taxpayer. It is to go all the way round through the Board. It will get lost up in Middlesbrough for month after month, resulting in reclaims, and so on. However, the Minister says that they will be speedy up there—I thought he was going to call them Speedy Gonzales instead of the Mandarins of Middlesbrough.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the vendor has had his money taken away from him, he is told "That is all right, you will get it back. But you will not get it back in the same course that you paid. It is going all the way around the country, and you may get it back if you make the proper reclaims". The Board will say "We may have some other claim against this. You may be owing tax on something else. You may be owing PAYE or VAT, and so on. We are going to put it aside, look at all your tax problems, all your tax matters for the past few years, and if you are owing anything this will be set against it".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We might have a little consideration in some part of this schedule for the poor unfortunate vendor. I hope that the Minister will say that, if there is an overpayment, the local authority—or the Welsh Development Board—will pay it straight back—with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman forthrightly seeks that the local authority should make payment for over-deductions to the taxpayer. I am bound to object to this suggestion. We have had speeches previously from hon. Members opposite saying that local authorities are acting as tax assessors. They are moving into the tax area and overturning the whole of fiscal law by providing even a form of deduction. Now we are asked to go even further and provide that the local authority shall pay back an excess of tax. I should have thought it better to rely upon the Inland Revenue to do this work. The taxpayer would prefer to have a cheque signed by the Chairman of the Inland Revenue to one signed by the town clerk of a local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The serious point that I have to make is that the less local authorities have to do in this area the better. We have had to impose some obligation upon them, and we have tried to restrict it to a form of deduction. We do not want to impose upon local authorities the task of being tax gatherers to a greater extent than we can help it. What if the cheque is wrong? What if the deduction is not

correct? The irate taxpayer goes to the town hall. He is very angry and rings up his councillor. The full paraphernalia of democracy is involved in taxation. We try to avoid this. I think that it is preferable that the money should come from the Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue—from the mandarins of Middlesbrough—rather than from the chief executive of a local authority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>Clause 39, to which we are not greatly attached, provides that where a person acquires an interest in development land from a person whose usual place of abode is outside the United Kingdom, the purchaser is required to make a deduction—in normal circumstances, 50 per cent.—from the purchase consideration paid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of Amendment No. 267 is part probing and part straight. The probing part is to try to establish what is actually meant by "usual place of abode" in terms of the various potential
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1325">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1413</span>
purchasers in the United Kingdom. What does it mean for a company, for a partnership, for persons, for trusts? All these bodies might be acquiring land and, whenever they are faced with the provisions of Clause 39, they will have the difficulty of establishing what is meant by the "usual place of abode" of the vendor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Amendment No. 415 we have made one suggestion as to a possible way of dealing with the difficulty. But with the present wording—I agree there would be difficulties with other forms of wording, though they might not be so great as with the words we have suggested—there remains the problem that any case of a purchase of land, which may have development value and therefore fall within the scope of this legislation, needs to be examined in order to establish the situation of the vendor, if there is any possibility of the usual place of abode being outside the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a serious problem in terms of interpretation of the clause, and I move the amendment to promote discussion about what is meant by "usual place of abode" and to suggest that
	<br><blockquote><p>"residence for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation",</p></blockquote>
might be a better phrase to use in this context.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seeks to replace the words "usual place of abode" in Clause 39 with the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"residence for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation".</p></blockquote>
He said that he did not like Clause 39 very much—neither do we—but it is there of necessity because of the great difficulty in collecting tax from non-residents. If a non-resident sells land in this country which has development value and makes a large profit, it may be very difficult—and in some circumstances impossible—to collect any tax, partly because he is not physically present here, partly because foreign courts will not enforce other countries' tax claims, and for other reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is very difficult to get money from foreign residents if they do not want to pay, and Clause 39 seeks to provide some protection. It does not go all the way. In fact, it is narrower in its net-of-tax principle than the local authority net-of-tax deduction, and it does not cover all cases. But it is an attempt to try to meet
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1414</span>
at least part of the problem, which could be a very real one, of people who go abroad investing in land in the United Kingdom and not paying a penny in development land tax if they dispose of that property or land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman queried the phrase "usual place of abode". It is used in taxation legislation, not so widely as "residence"—I shall come back to that—but there are precedents. Sections 54, 89, 391 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1970 use the phrase "usual place of abode", and we have used it here because it is easier—though it may not be easier in many circumstances—to determine the "usual place of abode", which is a physical factor, than to determine whether a person is resident in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards residence, it may not be possible to decide that on the facts of one year's assessment. Sometimes three or four years of assessment are needed to determine whether a person is resident in the United Kingdom. The rules on residence are extremely complicated, and the courts are full of cases for decision on whether a person is resident in the United Kingdom. Given the fact that the Government feel it necessary to have this kind of clause, I should have thought that the simplest way would be not to have the word "residence" but to have the simpler test of "usual place of abode", although I accept that in practice there may be difficulties even with that test.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Residence is not purely a question of fact. The determination of residence rests partly on fact and partly in law. It is a mixed situation where legal factors may determine whether there is residence or not. "Usual place of abode" is physical. The answer to the question: Where is a person's usual place of abode, or a company's usual place of abode, can usually be determined without difficulty, although there may be borderline cases. That is why we think "usual place of abode" is better than:
	<br><blockquote><p>"residence for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation."</p></blockquote>
This is not a clause about which I am enthusiastic, but it has to be embodied in the Bill to protect the Revenue against the making of large profits by non-residents who pay not one penny of tax. The inclusion of "usual place of abode" makes it easier for the purchaser to know whether the vendor is resident in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the Minister's argument rather surprising. It is very much a layman's argument. I do not say that in any disparaging way. Laymen's arguments are often better than lawyer's arguments. But it is a layman's argument that one can have simple legislation which is easily understood by simple people and that at the same time, one can avoid difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The advantage of using a term of art which has been much litigated is that one gets a precise definition. When professional advisors want to ascertain their client's position in relation to a term of art, they can at least look up the various judicial interpretations of that term of art, however unsatisfactory it may be. But if one then says that it has been so much litigated and such a nuisance that we must think of another simpler expression, one does nothing to simplify the legislation but introduces a new phrase which again is capable of a number of interpretations and which has to be re-interpreted by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a lot to be said for using terms of art, even if social customs have caused them to change and one has words like "curtilage", which does not have much reference to a linked detached house. There is an advantage in using terms of art which have already been litigated. I think that the Minister's argument that he was looking for a simpler term will store up trouble for the taxpayer and for the Revenue in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps not the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), but other members of the Committee. We cannot win, as I have said before. If we introduce a heavy legal phrase we are criticised. If we introduce a simple layman's test we are again criticised. I assure hon. Gentlemen that, despite the number of cases in the books, it is extremely difficult to determine whether a person is resident in this country or abroad. It is not dependent upon one year of assessment. If property is sold in year one, one cannot decide very often
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1416</span>
whether in that particular year a person is resident in the United Kingdom. One has to look at the previous years and the pattern of a person's movements. It would be far more difficult to decide whether tax should be deducted. I see that the Law Society has put forward this amendment. I am surprised that the Law Society should be so impractical. It should know better. This would impose a greater burden in deciding whether a person was resident. A person may have his usual place of abode in Switzerland but he may be resident in all sorts of countries. He may have three or four residences in the legal sense. He may have dual residence. What happens then? The use of the word "residence" will make it far more difficult, far more technical and complicated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not as though the words "usual place of abode" do not exist in our tax legislation. They are there. As far as I am aware, they have not given rise to the kind of litigation we have seen in regard to the word "residence". So whatever hon. Gentlemen may think about the clause and its various aspects, to substitute their words, including "residence", for the words "usual place of abode" would make it more difficult and make the clause even less desirable from their point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 415, in page 60, line 25, after 'shall', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'unless the contract for that disposal shall contain a warranty by the person making the disposal that his usual place of abode is not outside the United Kingdom)'.</p></blockquote>
In his reply on the previous amendment, the Minister said that, with us, is anxious that Clause 39 should be a readily workable in practice as possible. If his arguments about "usual place of abode" and "residence for purposes of United Kingdom taxation" are based on the need for the greatest certainty, we think we should endeavour in other ways to try to bring a little more certainty into the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One way in which the purchaser might be given a degree of certainty on which he could rely would be if it was acceptable for the purposes of this clause for a contract to contain a warranty by the vendor relating to his usual place of abode. It could then be clearly decided on that test whether the transaction fell within the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1417</span>
embrace of this provision. It may be that this is not acceptable for technical reasons. If not, perhaps there are other ways, and we should be interested to hear whether the Minister has other suggestions that would meet the same point or, at least, go some way towards meeting it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We foresee—as does the Law Society which has made representations about this—considerable difficulties at the point of contract where the purchaser remains in doubt as to whether he is obliged to deduct 50 per cent. from the purchase moneys because he is not able to establish the point about "usual place of abode".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Either by our suggested means or by some other, it would be helpful if the purchaser were given a fall-back position so that certainty could be achieved, and contracts which might otherwise be indefinitely delayed because of such uncertainty would thereby be facilitated.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the purchaser should have some kind of protection where he genuinely thought the facts were such-and-such and they turned out not to be so. For technical reasons, this amendment would not in itself, be acceptable, although, of course, in practice, if that kind of warranty were in the contract, I should have thought that the purchaser would be absolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are proposing to deal with this under the power to make regulations by issuing a regulation similar to Regulation 7 (3) of the Income Tax (Sub-Contractors in the Construction Industry) Regulation 1975, Statutory Instrument No. 1960 of 1975. There is a precedent for this in the construction industry, and there are certain rules about deduction of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the regulation which we intend to follow in respect of Clause 39. It provides that if the purchaser took reasonable care to comply with the provisions of the clause, and if, in spite of such reasonable care, he had been led to the genuine belief that a payment made by him, which was one to which the principal section applies, was not, or was not wholly, such a payment, he is absolved from responsibility and the Inland Revenue will not pursue him for the tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We intend to issue regulations, following the pattern in the contracting industry, to absolve the purchaser where he has acted in good faith and where he cannot be blamed for not deducting tax. In such a case, he will not be pursued. If there was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1418</span>
a warranty in the contract by the person making the disposal that would bring him within the regulations. But the regulations go wider than that. Even if there was not that kind of warranty in the contract, provided that the purchaser acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds for doing what he did, he would be relieved of any obligation under these regulations. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be convinced that that is good protection and that it goes wider than the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a helpful comment by the Minister. It is useful to have had Amendment No. 415 on the Amendment Paper for the purpose of probing and of achieving that statement, which will, I think, give some reassurance and which goes a good way to meeting the point behind the amendment. In view of the Minister's statement, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 263, in page 60, line 41, at end insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'or</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(	<i>c</i>) from any part of the consideration which is paid to a mortgagee resident in the United Kingdom'.</p></blockquote>
The position with which this amendment deals, relates to the deduction of 50 per cent. from payments made to overseas residents and the problems which that could raise where the property concerned is subject to a mortgage to a lender in the United Kingdom. I do not intend to go over the ground which we traversed earlier, relating to the problems of mortgagees, in general under the DLT deductions on purchases by local authorities, but much the same sort of considerations apply here, only with greater severity. In this case, there is only the 	<i>de minimis</i> exception and in all other cases, regardless of whether there may appear to be a liability to development land tax under ordinary rules, the deduction must be made. If 50 per cent. comes straight off the value of the consideration, it leaves mortgagees in an exposed position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore although there may again be problems in introducing the wording of Amendment No. 263 as it stands, I can see that this would open up other
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1328">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1419</span>
problems. There is, nevertheless, a general difficulty here which could greatly inhibit the way in which any overseas interests holding property in this country might be able to raise money on it. That, of course, could have other consequences. We therefore feel that, as regards the mortgagees, unless some provision is introduced along the lines of Amendment No. 263, there will be an even greater reluctance on the part of lenders to provide funds against property as security, when there is an overseas owner, than there will be generally because of the local authority provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have moved this amendment as a means of demonstrating our concern about the consequences of the provisions for lenders and their security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This amendment seeks to repeat the principle of previous amendments in relation to moneys paid to a mortgagee in respect of his security. In this case, it is moneys paid to a mortgagee in this country in respect of a mortgage of a mortgagor who is resident abroad. Under Clause 39 the purchaser would be under an obligation in certain circumstances to deduct 50 per cent. of the consideration on account of the DLT liability. I should make it clear that we are not concerned here with resident mortgagees. In the case of a mortgagee who sells the mortgaged land in the United Kingdom, Clause 31 treats the sale as having been made by the owner of the land who is to be liable to DLT in the ordinary way. So where there is a sale by a mortgagee and the owner lives in the United Kingdom the mortgagee will receive the whole of the consideration out of which to satisfy his loan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned here only with the case where the mortgagor is abroad. The mortgagee may be in this country. Given the background of the clause, I do not see why we should give this exemption to a defaulting non-resident mortgagor. I do not see why he should get the benefit of non-deduction in a case of this kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is to facilitate the recovery of tax from non-residents. I do not see why a non-resident who has not defaulted, if one can put it that way, has to suffer deduction, but a mortgagor
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1420</span>
abroad who has defaulted does not suffer DLT by deduction. I do not think that that would be fair or right. I accept entirely the reasoning behind the amendment. It is to raise the same concern that was raised earlier in relation to local authority purchases net of tax. But I could not possibly accept the amendment because it would go against the principle of the clause. It would make it easier for a defaulting mortgagor than for somebody who had ordered his affairs properly and whose usual place of abode was outside the United Kingdom. That would not be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of the clause is to enable the Revenue to recover the tax. I do not see why a defaulting non-resident mortgagor should get the kind of benefit that the amendment seeks to give.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment negatived.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 268, in page 62, line 4, leave out 'material'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In one sense I hope that this amendment is not acceptable to the Government because it would widen the scope of Clause 39. It is purely a probing amendment. We have tabled the amendment because we feel that it is necessary to draw attention to the difficulties of definition. We think that in general Clause 39 needs every possible tightening of definition that is available so that the purchaser in the United Kingdom may more readily ascertain whether in a particular transaction it is applicable to him. By removing the word "material" a number of extra cases would be brought within it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We feel that there would be difficulty in deciding whether there is a material development authorised by planning permission in some cases. This is merely to illustrate the problem, that has been put to us from many sources, that there are problems over place of abode, the exact nature of the planning permission and so on. It will be a very difficult clause to interpret.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am somewhat disappointed by the hon. Gentleman, as I was proposing to concede on this amendment. It would make life much more difficult for the Law Society and also some worthy gentlemen who drafted, or tried to draft, the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1329">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1421</span>
The hon. Gentleman has drawn attention to a difficult problem. The words "material development" are not entirely satisfactory. Whether we can provide words that are more satisfactory, I do not know. They are not entirely satisfactory, because the person on whom the obligation is imposed to deduct the tax has to decide, as far as I can see, whether it is a material development. This is a burden to place upon somebody who has to account for taxation. On the other hand, if as the amendment seeks, and as the hon. Gentleman recognises, we were to knock out the word "material" we should bring in a large number of small cases which we do not want to catch at all, because we are concerned here with a larger kind of development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether it is possible to have some kind of percentage test or whether that would complicate matters even more, it is easy to make commitments and then not follow them up. Without, therefore, making any commitment, I will look at this again to see whether it may be possible to have a simpler test, but I have my doubts. I recognise that the phrase "material development" could cause difficulty and that purchasers and their advisers would not know, very often, whether a development was a material development. Presumably they would have to err on the side of caution, because they would be tax collecting authorities for the purpose of that particular sale. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman does not want me to accept the amendment, but I quite understand the reason why.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to have to disappoint the Minister. I advised him at the outset that I did not wish to press the amendment or that I would not be happy if he were to accept it. He has given a useful assurance that the Government are fully aware of the problems of interpretation. That was the purpose of tabling the amendment and we have achieved that. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we leave this clause, I think we should make it clear, as I said in passing in relation to Amendment No. 267, that we are not happy about the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1422</span>
form in which this clause is drawn. It has been put to us from a number of quarters, as I have no doubt the Government will be aware, that it is likely to prove a harsh provision and not be helpful in attracting foreign investment to this country. Indeed, it could, as a result, incur reciprocal penalties against United Kingdom interests overseas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Putting the onus on the purchaser to identify a taxpayer who is not, as we have demonstrated, clearly defined in the clause, and having to collect tax without adequate information, will make matters difficult for the purchaser.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another point that was raised by the Law Society, and of which the Minister will be aware, related to the problem of dealing with deposits. Perhaps he is not aware of that. I believe it has been suggested that the payment of a deposit might be expressly excluded from the scope of the clause. I wonder whether this has been looked at by the Government. I think I should put it on record that we feel uneasy about the implications of this clause. We are glad that the Government share our unease, although perhaps they have not done all that we should have liked them to do in giving it greater certainty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I may reply on the deposit point. Without having been advised on this matter, as far as I can see the clause deals with consideration received for sale. I would not have thought that a deposit in the normal way of things was consideration for sale. It is a deposit. If the Law Society has made this representation, we will certainly look at it. As I have said previously, it is not entirely unusual for people who pay money abroad to have to deduct tax. Payment of copyright royalties and payment of rents abroad in certain cases to people whose abode is overseas, is made subject to deduction of tax. This is a small extension, but I think a very necessary extension, in order to prevent large sums of tax being avoided through the difficulties of collection and enforcement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The arrangements for payments of the kind mentioned by the Minister fall into a different class from the large-scale deductions for development land tax. I do not wish to refer at greater length to this, but we are not happy with the clause in its present form.

	<div class='title'>ADMINISTRATION OF DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 222, in page 137, leave out lines 32 to 36 and insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(3A) An appeal against an assessment to development land tax shall be to the General Commissioners, unless the appellant elects as in subsection (4) below, and paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (3) shall be amended accordingly.'</p></blockquote>
This is the first of many amendments which I hope to be moving. In fact, my book of words is almost as large as the Minister's. I hope I can remember it all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I begin by thanking the Minister's private office and the Minister for letting me see their briefs on the amendments. One objects when amendments are put down so late, but I have been treated with the utmost courtesy by the Minister's office, and for that I am extremely grateful. It may be because we agree with most of the Government amendments that I have had this help, in which case I hope that I do not make exactly the same speeches as the Minister does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The background to my amendment is that the Bill as it stands, except in exceptional circumstances, allows people to appeal only to the Special Commissioners, if they are concerned about the rate of tax for which they have been assessed. The exceptions are private residences and dwelling-houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1424</span>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 7.</p>
	<p>The first point to make in favour of our amendment, which gives the taxpayer the choice between the Special Commissioners and the General Commissioners, is that the insistence on the right of appeal to the Special Commissioners only is unusual in tax legislation. One accepts that this is an unusual and complex Bill—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gwilym Roberts</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad the hon. Member has accepted that. One welcomes his wisdom in many parts of the debate and in joining in our deliberations. He has plenty of opportunities still. We shall go on and on with Schedule 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the complexities and the originality—if that is not too favourable a word to use—of the Bill, it seems to us on this side of the Committee that there are extremely good reasons why the choice should be left to the taxpayer as to whether he goes to the Special Commissioners or the General Commissioners. The two reasons which have convinced me are that, first, as the Minister will be only too aware, the General Commissioners sit in the many localities of the inspectorate districts throughout the country and are, therefore, more likely to understand the local interests and particular circumstances which may affect a decision about the assessment. That is not a particularly important point, but it is relevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
9.45 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A much more important point in the context of this Bill is that if the taxpayer is only to be allowed to appeal to the Special Commissioners, in certain parts of the country he may have the opportunity to appeal on very infrequent occasions. In the West Country, for example, the Special Commissioners sit
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1331">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1425</span>
very infrequently—perhaps once a year. That would be acceptable—just—were it not for the penal interest requirements which we shall be discussing in later parts of the schedule. If the taxpayer is only allowed to appeal to a body which sits in his area once a year, and if, as a result, he has to wait a year for his appeal to be heard, and if he is paying a 9 per cent. rate of interest from the reckonable date, as the Bill currently quite wrongly stands—a matter which we shall discuss on later amendments—then that is immensely unfair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg the Minister, who is extremely knowledgeable in these matters, to reconsider the Bill. We are not suggesting anything very new or dramatic or which in any way affects the principle of the Bill, but it could be of immense practical advantage to the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's amendment seeks to give the taxpayer an election whether to go to the Special Commissioners or to the General Commissioners on all matters relating to DLT. As he will be aware, the taxpayer has this election in cases involving exemptions relating to private residences or dwelling-houses built for owner occupation. In those cases, he can go to the General Commissioners. In all other cases, however, under the Bill as drafted, he has to go to the Special Commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman did not read my brief as well as he should have done. He said there was no particular reason in tax law why that should be so. In fact, there is. Section 31 of the Taxes Management Act 1970 distinguishes between appeals against assessments made centrally, which are normally determined by Special Commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not put that forward as a convincing and devastating argument to destroy the hon. Gentleman's case. But it has some logic, in that appeals which are determined centrally by the board generally go to the Special Commissioners, but appeals against assessments made locally by inspectors normally lie to General Commissioners. There is a principle underlying all this legislation. As the hon. Gentleman told the Committee, and as I told the Committee, assessments in this case will be made centrally from Middlesbrough under the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1426</span>
authority of the Board of Inland Revenue, not by local inspectors. So there is some logic in that case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other reason, I should have thought, would be that no member of this Committee would wish to impose upon General Commissioners of Income Tax—a very worthy body of people who work very hard in the interests of the community—the burden of deciding appeals in relation to this extremely complicated tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not an entirely bogus point. It is extremely complicated, as hon. Gentlemen keep on telling us. It is not a simple matter of defining profit or finding out whether there is income or what the expenses of a business are. I shudder to think what would happen if two General Commissioners somewhere in the West Country—perhaps in West Wales—two worthy local farmers, had to decide the interaction provisions of Schedule 6. That would be a wholly wrong thing to do and a wholly wrong burden to place upon people who give their services voluntarily and do very good work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, there is an important point here. This is an extremely complicated tax. I should have thought, from my limited experience, that the Special Commissioners would be the best people to deal with this kind of situation, subject to two exceptions. If it is a question of residence, exemption or acreage—yes, it is a local matter. The others are not local matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I come to the other point—which is a good point, if I may say so—about commissioners sitting more often in London than anywhere else. That is true, and although they do travel round the country, they sit in the principal cities at least once a year. I accept that they might go to the West Country once and no more. That is a good point. But the reference to the complexity of the legislation outweighs the question of that kind of convenience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The procedure before the Special Commissioners is very simple. If a person loses before the commissioners, he does not have to pay costs. The commissioners are an experienced body of men. Frankly, if I were a taxpayer in Bodmin or Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, I would rather have my appeal before the Special Commissioners, even in London, than take an extremely complicated case like this to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1332">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1427</span>
the General Commissioners who frankly, through no fault of their own, would not have a clue what was going on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am usually most impressed by the pungency of the Minister's argument and his ability to argue, although I disagree fundamentally in principle with him almost entirely. But on this occasion I think he has produced the most appalling arguments against the points I argued most reasonably. First, he says that because the assessment is made centrally, the appeal should necessarily be made centrally. He argues that on a point of reason. It was a tautological argument.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman insists on taking that view. He has done so on previous amendments. I did not say that. What I said was that there was a certain logic in the taxing statutes that, where an assessment was made centrally, usually the appeal was to the Special Commissioners. Where an assessment was made by the inspector, usually the appeal was to the General Commissioners.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Leaving those points, I do not accept that merely because a previous Act says that a thing is logical, that is necessarily an end to the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A much more important point that he made, and much more of an indictment against the Bill rather than against this amendment, was that because the Bill is so complex, as we have daily pointed out, it is too complex for the ordinary man to understand, and therefore, we should not employ the services of the General Commissioners. It is late at night and perhaps the Minister is tired, but that is the most horrific indictment of this piece of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are enacting legislation which, when the ordinary man looks at it carefully—and the General Commissioners are chosen because they are able to deal with this sort of matter—they will not understand it. Because the highly intelligent representative of the ordinary man in the street will not understand it, we should therefore refer him to some specialist, legalistic hidden operation which occasionally ventures out into the distant parts where ordinary men reside. That is appalling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1428</span>
That is the argument on which the Government base their case—that the ordinary layman will not be allowed to come in on the act in the appeal arrangements. I therefore ask my hon. Friends to press this matter to a Division. It is a matter of principle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am rather frightened by what the Minister said and by what my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) has said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose the fact that at this time of night we are looking at page 137—I thought it must be a misprint on the Order Paper—at what ought to be a simple tax on one particular form of gain, it is pretty frightening. But when the Minister says that we must not place the burden of appeals on this extremely complicated tax on the General Commissioners, one becomes even more frightened. I wonder whether we are right to place the burden of appeal of this extremely complicated tax even on the Special Commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am not clear about—and among my many interests I have not declared is the fact that I am not a barrister and not a tax expert, matters in which one might have a modest pride on these occasions—is, what if the appeal is about the matter of value? Surely one of the problems here is that valuation of property is a matter of opinion, whereas the things which the General Commissioners and the Special Commissioners normally deal with are matters of fact. How will the Special Commissioners be able to contribute to an expert opinion on valuation? I find this rather puzzling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To put the hon. Gentleman out of his misery on that point, when there are valuation matters they will go to the Lands Tribunal, and no doubt members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors—even honorary members—will be able to take advantage of that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister. He is saying, therefore, that anything to do with the question of valuation will go to the Lands Tribunal. Can he tell us how long it will take to come out of the Lands Tribunal? What will the role of the Special Commissioners be after that? This makes the tax situation even more frightening. How

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>1429</span>
many more people will the Minister appoint to the Lands Tribunal, and how many more times will it have to sit to resolve these cases?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
