	<p>	<i>Amendment proposed</i>—	<i>(29th April)</i>—No. 167, in page 19, line 4, to leave out 'the year 1979' and insert 'the year 1984'—[	<i>Mr. Budgen</i>].</p>
	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I should not reply at too great a length to Amendment No. 167. However, at our previous sitting there was not time to reply to this amendment, so perhaps I should do so now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment seeks to substitute the date 1984 in place of 1979 in relation to the transitional provision, whereby for three years development land tax shall be 66⅔ per cent. of the first £150,000 of development value, after the £10,000 slice
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that hon. Members opposite think that the rate of 80 per cent. is too high. I would not want to wade through the arguments. But perhaps I may mention again the reason the lower rate was chosen. It was not chosen necessarily because we felt that the 80 per cent. rate was too high, although I can appreciate arguments in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Representations were made to us that there might be some difficulty in land coming on to the market during the next two or three years because of what has happened in the past. Because of the general economic situation there might be problems in relation to land supply, and if the rate were reduced over a period of three years on a tranche of £150,000 smaller parcels of land might be brought on to the market. In response to those representations, we decided to establish this lower rate for three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to substitute 1984 that would defeat the purpose of the lower tranche
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>840</span>
of £150,000. I accept that hon. Members might say that they want a lower rate. But if one accepts that one of the purposes of having a lower tranche over a three-year period was to bring land on to the market during the next three years by putting in 1984, we would be defeating the object of that exercise. We would be creating a reduction in tax but we would be defeating the object of the exercise, which is to give an additional incentive, if that is required, to bring land, especially the smaller plots of land that the smaller builders will want, on to the market during the period of three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Indeed, it seems that builders are to some extent responding to this concession and incentive. I have here an advertisement. I will not give the name of the builder concerned but perhaps I could say to right hon. and hon. Gentlemen that there have been advertisements appearing in several newspapers in the South East of England by a large firm of housebuilders to the effect that they are
	<br><q><p>"urgently seeking potential house building land".</p></q>
They go on to point out
	<br><q><p>"the concessionary tax rate on the first £150,000 (which is only for a limited period)"</p></q>
will enable one to benefit by selling one's land to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, this is a case of a large firm of housebuilders in the South East of England which is advertising at the moment on the basis of this concession. It is saying "We want this land to come on to the market. This is a three-year concession. Please sell your land to us because you will pay less tax. We need this land to build homes for people." I think that indicates to some extent that the objective of the concession is, perhaps, fulfilling the good reasons we had for introducing it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we were to put in "1984" that purpose would be defeated, and that kind of advertisement could not appear in any of the local newspapers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need to labour the arguments. There is a difference between us on the rate of the tax. But we think that this is fair and that it would bring housing land on to the market. We believe that both sides of the Committee would agree that this would be all to the good. Therefore, I ask the Committee not to accept the amendment which seeks to insert the date 1984 instead of 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The other amendments which we are to discuss together with Amendment No. 283, subject to one that I shall refer to later, are consequential upon the main amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These amendments have been tabled in response to criticisms which have been made in Committee, of the interpretation provisions of the Bill. We have received, too, representations from outside bodies to the same effect, and the amendments are in response to the criticism made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principal purpose of the amendments is to insert cross-references in Clause 46, although we have technical reasons for introducing the first amendment, Amendment No. 283. Clause 46, as hon. Members
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1022">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>843</span>
know, is the interpretation clause to definitions contained elsewhere in the Bill. A few of the amendments will also clarify certain interpretations by ensuring that a particular definition applies throughout the Bill. The criticism made was that definitions did not appear to apply throughout the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, Amendment No. 291 makes a substantive change. I am sorry to bring it forward now, but there will be an opportunity to discuss it later because it refers to Schedule 8 as well. Amendment No. 291 is the one which changes the definition of what is now in the legislation as the reckonable date. It ensures that when someone is charged for DLT in the name of another person, interest starts to run from the reckonable date in relation to that other person's liability. For example, where a beneficiary is assessed to DLT under paragraph 53 of Schedule 8, which we could come back to discuss on Schedule 8, the administration schedule which deals with dates of assessment when interest is supposed to run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a beneficiary is assessed under Schedule 8 (53) because of the failure of trustees or personal representatives to pay a DLT liability incurred by them, interest runs from a reckonable date in relation to the trustee's DLT liability. If this amendment were not made, it could be argued that the reckonable date would be three months after the beneficiary became liable for the DLT, that is, three months after he was assessed. This would enable the interest charge to be avoided for several months, or even years in some cases. So this amendment is to ensure that the three-month period runs from the date of the primary liability to the liability of the trustees. But, as I say, because of the short notice, hon. Gentlemen might prefer to look at the matter again in the context of Schedule 8.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also advised that there is one amendment which cannot be put down in Committee now because the relevant clause has already been passed, but it will be put down on Report. It will change the wording of Clause 2(3) so that the definition of "major interest" applies for the purposes of the Bill generally. There was criticism that the definition of "major interest" did not seem to apply to the Bill generally, but the amendment on Report will ensure that that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments will be put down later in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>844</span>
Committee to provide an interpretation paragraph for other parts of Schedule 8. When we reach that schedule, we shall seek to have an interpretation paragraph for Schedule 8 itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope this is not too confusing. It is an attempt by the draftsman to try to meet some of the criticisms and, as such, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

So far as the amendments cover changes in the technicality of the Bill, they are improvements which arise as a result of our constructive criticism and we are pleased to be able to welcome them and thank the Minister for the way in which he has dealt with the matter, but we wish to reserve our position on the Schedule 8 amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><q><p>'(or, he not being in occupation, that of his spouse from whom he is separated or his former spouse from whom he is divorced)'.</p></q>
We now come to a series of amendments on the important clause dealing with exemption for owner-occupied property. Clause 14 is concerned to set a general principle that no development land tax is payable if a person sells his own house which is his sole residence. That is in no way unusual and in no way a particularly munificent concession, although it is welcome for all that. Section 29 of the Finance Act 1965 contains similar provisions and I shall be saying a word about it on the next amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 189 seeks to provide that the exemption shall also accrue for a man's wife from whom he is separated or divorced if she has been awarded the matrimonial home in a divorce action, or if they have reached a private settlement regarding separation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had some discussion on this matter on Clause 10, which dealt with the liability to taxation in the case of inheritance or a gift, but I believe that it is relevant to stress the point again now. I do not need to go into the heart-rending talk we had last time about the unhappy circumstances of divorce. We all know that that is true. We are simply concerned with avoiding a situation where, as well as those unhappy circumstances, there may also be a liability to development land tax on the matrimonial home.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) correctly points out that we have discussed part of this problem—the larger issue of development land tax in relation to the disposal of property in general—on a previous clause. As I understand it, the amendment seeks to extend the exemption which exists for an owner-occupier in respect of his main residence, to divorce settlements where a husband—although it could be the wife—in whose name the house is, moves out of the house and the wife remains, and if a settlement follows when the house is
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>846</span>
transferred to the wife in consideration of various maintenance agreements and so forth, as these matters are dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In such situations, since the husband had left occupation and the wife was still in occupation, the house would clearly have ceased to be the husband's main residence and he might not get the benefit of the exemption provisions contained in this clause. Were that the case, development land tax would be payable on that transfer because it would have been made by a person of a house which was not his main residence—that is, the husband would have ceased to occupy the house. I take it that that is the sort of situation to which the hon. Gentleman refers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not think that there is a major problem here. One must stress—and I shall return to this in relation to the other amendments—that we are concerned with development land tax and not capital gains tax. That point should be made because, in the case of capital gains tax, in practically all cases these days, there will be a capital gain of some sort, such as an increase in the current value of a house. In respect of development land tax, this will not normally be the case. In most cases, there would be no development value, although there could be, as in the case of a large house with a garden. I accept that kind of situation, but by and large there will be no development gain in the nature of things. If there is a development gain, one should again, appreciate, that the first £10,000 of the gain will be exempt from that tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not now in the situation that we were in when the legislation was first mooted, where the exemption would have been a £5,000 disposals exemption. Then, the £5,000 disposals exemption became a £5,000 first-slice exemption—which is beneficial—and that £5,000 first-slice exemption became a £10,000 first-slice exemption. So we are talking about a case—although rare—of a house having development value, of the husband having moved out, and of that development value being in excess—that is, the actual realisable development value—of £10,000. There could be a few cases of that kind but they would not justify an exemption of this kind for such a situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the house is worth that much, it would not be unfair for the extra above the £10,000 to be charged to development land tax. But it is, of course, part of a
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1024">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>847</span>
larger issue and the right hon. Gentleman said he would table an amendment on Report with regard to the transfers of property in relation to divorce settlements. Perhaps it might be said to be unfair to some extent if one dealt with this situation in isolation, because there might be other cases of property—as indeed there would be—transferred in divorce settlements, where this amendment would give them no exemption at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under this amendment, we would be giving exemptions in relation to property which is not the vendor's or the transferor's main residence. I do not see why those properties should be treated differently in the circumstances from other properties or assets that might be transferred. Perhaps the best way of dealing with this matter would be in relation to the general argument with regard to divorce arrangements, and not to single out one particular situation. I recognise that in a few cases there might be some difficulty, but we do not think that this is a major problem, and I cannot recommend acceptance of the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has completely mistaken the drift of this amendment. Normally, he explains our amendments very well, perhaps better than we explain them ourselves, and then proceeds to disagree with them. We are not dealing with ownership or a settlement where the ownership of property passes from one spouse to another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are dealing here with a simple case of the ownership remaining where it is and the separated or divorced spouse taking occupation. I do not think we can deal with that matter under the general settlements on divorce or separation—a point which I had hoped to deal with by an amendment at a later stage. This is a simple case where one spouse goes out of occupation and that spouse happens to be the owner of the property, thereby disqualifying himself or herself from the benefit of Clause 14(1). It is not unfair on any other case if one gives the exemption in this clause. We are dealing with the main residence—in this case the matrimonial home—which happens to have devolved on one party who is not the owner. The occupation has devolved, but not the ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not follow the logic of the Minister's argument that this would be a rare
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>848</span>
case. Of course one hopes that in the event it would be a rare case, but not from the point of view of the property. If it is a rare case from the taxation viewpoint, the whole of this clause applies to rare cases, which is not true. We are dealing with main residences. So far as the property and the tax position are concerned, there is no difference between the case which we are putting in this amendment and the case of the owner still remaining in occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One hopes that it would be a rare case so far as the parties are concerned, and that there will not be too many divorces and separations, but if one is going to argue that this is so rare that the tax would be payable on the main residence, one is saying that it is not worth including Clause 14 at all. This is a very simple case of the split between occupation and ownership which ought not to be allowed to deprive the owner of the benefit of Clause 14.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman thought I had not understood the amendment. As he continued to speak, I thought that perhaps I had, because he made the point which I tried to make, perhaps not very well, that we were concerned with a split between occupation and ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The husband may have given up occupation, but remains in ownership either of half or of the whole house. As I understand the amendment, it seeks to give relief if later he transfers that house to his ex-wife who is still living in the house. The right hon. Gentleman is concerned that that transfer would be subject to DLT if there was a development value because the house was not his main residence any more. That is the point to which I thought the amendment was addressed. I am glad to see that the right hon. Gentleman agrees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in some difficulty because I concede to some extent that there could be cases where this would be the affect. It is only fair to tell the Committee, too, that the position has arisen in relation to capital gains tax from time to time. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) will not be very pleased when he hears that there is, in fact, an extra-statutory concession which has been published and is not in someone's filing cabinet. It looks splendid. It is "Extra-Statutory Concessions Supplement (1974)",
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1025">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>849</span>
and has "Board of Inland Revenue" at the top, so there is nothing underhand about it. It deals with this kind of situation in relation to capital gains tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to be fair with the Committee. This concession is because this problem has arisen in regard to capital gains tax. The two taxes are different. I am not seeking to make a debating point. The two taxes are different in that capital gains tax is a fairly common situation as there will usually be an increase in current use value. That is not the case with DLT. There may be a development value from time to time but, of course, that would cover fewer cases than in the capital gains tax position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, because we have seen the problem in relation to capital gains tax, and because there is an extra-statutory concession, I will not ask the Committee to accept the amendment. I am prepared, however, to look at it and to think about it again. I cannot go further, and I hope that the Committee will not consider it to be too vague.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful. The purpose of Amendment No. 147 and the other amendments, for which the Committee should be indebted to the patience and drafting skill of my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), is to redraft Clause 14 in order to bring it into line with the main exemption provisions for capital gains tax contained in Section 29 of the Finance Act 1965. Indeed, I might call it the Page-Keeling schedule, since my right hon. Friend has rightly appreciated the value to practitioners of harmonising the exemptions in Section 29 of the 1965 Act with those in Clause 14 of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wearisome for the Committee if I went through each of the amendments one by one and illustrated the differences between Section 29 and the clause as drafted, so I will take one amendment as an illustration and then deal with one or two others which contain separate points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1027">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>853</span>
Taking Amendment No. 147 as an illustration, and looking at subsection (2) of the clause as drafted, we see that a private residence is defined either as
	<br><q><p>"land comprising a dwelling-house which, at the time of the disposal in question, is that individuals' only or main residence; and land which at that time he has for his own occupation and enjoyment with that dwelling-house as its garden or grounds up to an area which, when aggregated with the area of the site of that dwelling-house, does not exceed one acre;"</p></q>
If one looks at Section 29 of the Finance Act 1965, which, as Mr. Speaker says about the Queen's Speech, "I have for greater convenience obtained a copy", one sees there that the definition is:
	<br><q><p>"a dwelling-house or part of a dwelling-house, which is, or has at any time in his period of ownership been, his only or main residence"</p></q>
That is an extension of what is in the Bill as at present drafted. Section 29(b) states:
	<br><q><p>"land which he has for his own occupation and enjoyment with that residence as its garden or grounds up to an area (inclusive of the site of the dwelling-house) of one acre or such larger area as the Commissioners concerned may in any particular case determine,"</p></q>
It goes on to qualify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Amendment No. 147 we have gone two and a half times further than the wording of Section 29, because we have changed one acre into one hectare, partly for metrication reasons—although, to put it mildly, I am not a lover of metrication—and partly because we think that the figure of two and a half acres, which is approximately what one hectare would represent, would increase the potential amount of land exempted from the tax. Therefore, it is more likely to come on to the market as infilling land, being, of course, a large garden or paddock. That sort of land is absolutely invaluable to the housebuilding programme. Infilling of that sort, particularly in villages, has an extremely important part to play and it is essential that that land comes forward. However, I am not going to go through all the amendments and compare them with Section 29.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to Amendment Nos. 321 and 322, which, although they follow Section 29 in some ways, are important in themselves. Amendment No. 321 is intended to avoid liability on the disposal by a person of his second residence where
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>854</span>
his main residence may be a flat occupied in town but not owned by him, or where, due to his employment—either in this country or overseas—he has to live in other accommodation, leaving the residence which he formerly occupied as his only or main residence either available for occupation by someone else or standing empty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While treating the flat or overseas residence as his only or main residence—and this is a question of fact, since in the Bill as drafted no election procedure is contained—he may have to carry out a computation of liability on the disposal of his house. The Minister would doubtless say that in such circumstances the current use value would approximate to that of the market value and that the adjustment of 10 per cent. amply covers the situation which I am describing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there are four reasons which occur to me why this might not be the case. First, the person's normal residence or flat which he owns may be an area of more than one acre. Secondly, it may be near to the centre of a town where redevelopment of the town centre is taking place so that the price paid is more relevant to the future occupation of the land than to its present occupation—namely, that there is an element of hope value in it. Thirdly, a compulsory purchase order may give rise to an unexpected liability when the owner has never even contemplated selling the property. Fourthly, the person, if in employment overseas, may not be able to afford the time to return to the United Kingdom and instruct, for example, valuers to ensure that there is no liability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This provision in Amendment No. 321, which I am commending to the Committee, is similar to that contained in the Finance Act 1965, which permits a person to treat as periods of residence in his United Kingdom property such periods as he is forced by his employment to spend overseas, with certain limits—usually three or four years. I have given four examples where development land tax might accrue where the 110 per cent. tolerance would not be satisfactory, and this is why we believe the amendment is desirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to Amendment No. 322, which would provide both the individual and his personal representatives the power to elect which of one or more properties he is to treat as his only or main residence.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1028">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>855</span>
What we have in mind is to cover those cases where a person may be coming up to retirement and wishes to leave a property near or in the centre of a town and live near the coast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For example, let us suppose that someone occupies an old property in half an acre of land in Reading—an old Victorian house with a large garden. He wishes to sell that property and retire to a smaller house in, say, Bournemouth—or, if the Minister of State and the Financial Secretary prefer—to Llanelli or Ashton-under-Lyne. It is possible that the price that he can obtain for the house in Reading would be such that realised development value may accrue because there is a large garden, it is in the centre of the town and there is an element of hope value in the property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without an election procedure such as we are suggesting, the taxpayer may have to carry out the absurdity as he approaches retirement age and perhaps is reducing his working week, of living, say, four days a week in Reading and three days a week in Bournemouth, Llanelli, Ashton-under-Lyne or wherever he has retired. Alternatively, he may move to the seaside, leaving his house mostly unoccupied while he seeks to obtain a buyer because once he starts to live mainly in the seaside residence the Reading property will cease to be his only or main residence and a liability could arise. That seems to be a totally unreasonable situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all these cases, I appreciate that, in normal circumstances, no tax liability would accrue because of the 110 per cent. tolerance provisions or, as the Minister has said, the £10,000 slice exemption. But a great deal of building takes place in the centre of towns on the sites of old Victorian houses in large gardens where the houses are knocked down in order to get an infilling gain, often by building flats. My company has built many such properties. In such circumstances, a liability may well arise. I do not think that either of the proposals we have put forward in Amendments Nos. 321 and 322 would be in any way seriously detrimental to the Revenue or make any practical difference at all, but they would make some difference to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have dealt with three of the amendments at some length. Many of the other amendments are consequential and all of them attempt to get the drafting of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>856</span>
Clause 14 and Section 29 of the Finance Act 1965 into harmony.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has explained that these amendments in effect seek to replace or substantially rewrite Clause 14 to make it more like Section 29 of the Finance Act 1965. The amendments and the pages and pages of excellent drafting seek to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 147 and 148, as the hon. Member has explained them, would provide a time apportionment basis for calculating the exemption from DLT, including rules for periods of absence, and would also extend the inclusive area for exemption to one hectare instead of the one acre as at present. I am advised that Amendment No. 114 duplicates part of Amendment No. 148 and will introduce rules for periods of absence as a proviso to Subsection 3. Amendments Nos. 149 and 150 are consequential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal first with Amendments Nos. 147, 148, 114, 149 and 150, which all seem to change the present basis to a time-apportionment basis of calculation and to try to import the capital gains tax rules. We think that there is a difference between development land tax and capital gains tax, and that is why Clause 14 is drafted in a different way from the capital gains tax rules. It would be quite easy to have lifted the capital gains tax rules and put them into the Bill. It would have made the Bill more complicated because, as we can see from the amendments, we need more lines of drafting because the capital gains tax provisions are more complicated of their nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The reason they are more complicated, and the reason why we rejected a Section 29 approach, is that we are concerned with a different kind of tax. We are not concerned with a tax where the betterment value of property increases gradually—perhaps not so gradually sometimes—every year, as happens with current use value. Capital gains tax charges current use value, and because current use value generally increases from year to year, more or less according to a pattern, it was necessary to have a time-apportionment basis for Section 29 of the Finance Act 1965. The whole of those rules revolve around the time-apportionment approach, if I can put it that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we talk about development land
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1029">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>857</span>
tax, we are concerned with a possible shallow increase in current use value. Then, because of the change in surroundings or circumstances, the council gives planning permission, and a betterment or development value suddenly erupts which is often far greater than the current use value. That is a different kind of tax and situation from the capital gains tax situation. I therefore ask hon. Members to accept that the drafting is different because it was felt that one was dealing, not with an increase in current use value over a period of years where time apportionment would apply, but with a specific increase in value as a result of a change in circumstances. That is why we have applied the rules as they have been applied.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the amendment which seeks a change from one acre to one hectare, that would possibly be too generous. We would be getting up to two-and-a-half acres, and the exemptions are fairly generous to an owner-occupier at present, so I could not accept that amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree that one hectare was a "hope value" in the amendment, but the words after that,
	<br><q><p>"or such larger area as the Commissioners concerned may in any particular case determine,"</p></q>
seem to be of some value, even if one had one acre in, to leave a little flexibility for the commissioners to decide in a particular case. That is taken from the capital gains tax legislation, and I assume that it has worked out in that case, so I ask the Minister to look at it from that point of view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps when I have dealt with the other amendments I can think about that point. I promise the right hon. Gentleman that I shall return to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment Nos. 151 and 322 basically ask for the same thing, and the hon. Gentleman dealt with Amendment No. 322—the right to elect which of two residences is the main residence. I am sorry to say that I have strong feelings about this and am not disposed to go along with him. My personal view is that the capital gains tax provisions are far from satisfactory in this regard. The idea that, once we give a main residence exemption, the taxpayer can then elect, to fly completely in the face of the facts and say
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>858</span>
"That is my main residence. I have been living in that house for a very long time and I am using that house as my main residence", is extremely illogical and it could be argued that the capital gains tax rules are illogical, although there is no intention to change them. In this case, to fly in the face of a situation and say "I want to choose the one which gives me the greater tax exemption, although that may not be my main residence", is illogical and unreasonable in the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are giving an exemption for a main residence. If it is a taxpayer's main residence, and if he can show the inspector that it is his main residence, he gets his tax exemption from DLT. If it is not his main residence, there is no justification for giving him an exemption when the basis of such an exemption is a main residence exemption. That is why I am not prepared to go along with that amendment although, as I have said, it is in the capital gains tax legislation, in which, some people will argue, it should not have been put that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 154 and 206 will provide exemption from DLT for a private dwelling house occupied by a dependent relative as his only, or main residence. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman recollects whether I actually touched upon that subject, but I think Amendment No. 206, again, seeks to incorporate the words of Section 29—the dependent relative exemption from capital gains tax—into this legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are several of the amendments which I did not bother to describe in detail, partly because, as I said, they repeated Section 29, anyway, and partly because their detailed drafting would make it clear to the Minister's advisers, when reading them, what was involved.

pared to incorporate in the legislation the same exemption that exists for capital gains tax. That might sound slightly illogical after what I have said, but we are concerned about dependent relatives and it is only fair and just that one should recognise such an exemption. I do not think there would be many such cases. I am not absolutely certain that the amendments reproduce the capital gains tax provision, but we will table an amendment on Report which reproduces the capital gains tax provision and give the exemption in those cases to dependent relatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, Amendment No. 321 deals with rented accommodation, which is a difficult matter. The difficulty arose for capital gains tax and no doubt in some albeit fewer cases; it could arise under this legislation. This is a situation of a person who has to live either in rented accommodation or in employer accommodation—representative accommodation—where he must live in certain premises because of his employment and he wants to buy a house for his retirement. The current house is not his main residence because it belongs to his employer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a difficult situation. We have had representations for capital gains tax, but we have been unable to meet them because it is practically impossible merely to deal with those hard cases without also having to bring in other cases of rented accommodation, where a person decides to rent accommodation and not live in what would otherwise be his main residence. It is impossible to draw the line between the hard case and the others. It is unfortunate, but I must tell the Committee that it could not be done and I cannot therefore accept Amendment No. 321.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out that temporary periods of absence would not deny the relief. Once again we are concerned with whether the house is the main residence of the individual. It could be his main residence although he might not have been living there for a few months. I accept that if he goes abroad for a long time it might be a different situation, but the test is a practical, factual test as to whether or not it is his main residence. Temporary periods of absence would not necessarily mean that the exemption would be lost, but if the absences became longer and more permanent, they might be.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry I cannot accept Amendment No. 321, but it goes much wider than some
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>860</span>
of the difficult cases that we have had to face in relation to capital gains tax, and we were unable to meet those cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman asked about the capital gains tax provision relating to one acre or such larger area as the commissioners might in practice allow. I am advised that that exemption was allowed for practical reasons. I cannot see any good reasons for not giving it. It has operated reasonably well for capital gains tax, and I am prepared to recommend an amendment to give that extra relief if the commissioners think it would be reasonable in the circumstances. If we find that it leads to abuse, we will have to reconsider the matter. However, I think it is a good point, and provided there is no danger of abuse or avoidance, we will table an amendment to that effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise only to ask for clarification of one point. In doing so, perhaps I should declare a retrospective interest in the sense that I sold a piece of a paddock for development. My hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) spoke about a paddock being within the exemption for capital gains tax, coming within the definition of garden or grounds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My understanding is that there is a good deal of uncertainty as to what the word "grounds" means, and whether it is to be taken as 	<i>ejusdem generis</i> with garden, or whether it allows a wider exemption to take into account such areas of land as a paddock. It was plain to me from what my hon. Friend said that either he had more knowledge than I had about this matter, or else there was some uncertainty about it. I think there is some uncertainty about it. I spoke to him a moment ago and he said that "grounds" would come within the curtilage of the house. I am not sure that that is so. If we are trying to achieve some certainty in the law, the expression "all grounds" is one that is capable of some misunderstanding, as I know from my personal experience.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) has scored some extremely important points. We are grateful to the Minister for informing us of his intentions to accept a number of points arising out of the group of amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first group, the time apportionment basis of calculation, I see the logic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1031">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>861</span>
of the Minister's argument. To a great extent we inserted the time-apportionment basis because we wanted a longer period for obtaining this benefit. But I should like to have a further look at that after what the Minister has said. It may not be wise at this stage to press the Minister further on these aspects. We are very grateful for the point that he has conceded, that he thinks that if we can give the commissioners a little more flexibility over the one acre it will be advantageous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Amendments Nos. 151 and 322, dealing with the right to elect, I am puzzled. The Minister said that he did not intend to repeal the position as it applied to the capital gains tax, but does that mean that one could choose a main residence for capital gains tax purposes, and perhaps a different residence for development land tax. If that is the position, it is going to cause some confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, through practical experience on this right to elect, I agree with the Minister. It is a concession which was given to capital gains tax, but I know from experience that it has perhaps given the taxpayer a choice which does not altogether seem fair to other taxpayers. Perhaps I am giving away something which my hon. Friend the Member for Melton would not give away in his amendment, but I want to know if one is to be left the choice in capital gains tax of saying "this place is my main residence for capital gains tax purposes, but for development land tax purposes the other is my main residence".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are extremely grateful to the Minister for accepting the principle of Amendments Nos. 154 and 206 covering dependent relative exemptions. We shall look forward to seeing an amendment in due course which will improve on our own amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding Amendment No. 321, covering rented accommodation where a person has to live away from the main residence by reason of his employment, there has not been difficulty in drafting such a provision in the Rent Acts in which the position seems to be accepted that there are certain matters that a landlord can preserve if he is away from his premises by reason of employment, and I should have thought that one could look again at the possibility of the right of definition here and apply it in this case. The Minister
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>862</span>
says that temporary periods of absence would not disqualify and I thought that he recognised that there were cases which would go beyond temporary periods of absence and there would be hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the hon. Gentleman was going to encourage or provoke my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) by saying that he would produce an extra statutory direction on this and be rather generous over what is temporary absence and what is not temporary absence. However, I feel that this matter might be examined further and cases of hardship relieved. The Minister has given us great encouragement for the further stage of the Bill. We shall look forward to the amendments which he proposes to recommend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I deal first with the capital gains tax and development land tax in relation to main residences. My reply to the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) is that there could be a different treatment because the two Acts are different. The capital gains tax is more generous in the sense that we are getting close to an election of what is a main residence. In this situation, it follows the facts, and there could be a situation where that would happen. I will not go into the question of whether that would be the fault of this legislation or the Finance Act 1965. I have checked what he said. He said that he thinks we have, perhaps, a more logical test here than in the 1965 Act. However, the 1965 Act has been in operation for a long time and we have no intention of changing it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the beginning of my remarks, Mr. Fitch, I said that I disliked talking about divisions before I had even made my case let alone heard the Minister's reply. Indeed, having heard his reply I do not feel it will be necessary to ask you to call any amendments for division. I think we can do without that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Like my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), I am grateful to the Minister for the considerable assurances that he has given on many points. My right hon. Friend was kind enough to say that I had scored a number of hits. I simply say that although the hands may be the hands of Esau the voice is that of Jacob. The credit should go to my right hon. Friend and his formidable industry

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>863</span>
in preparing this amendment, and to the Minister for his sympathetic response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 327, in page 20, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><q><p>'Provided that no apportionment shall be made if the part exclusively used for the purposes of a trade or business or of a profession, vocation, office or employment does not exceed one-fifth of the cubic capacity of the entire dwelling-house'.</p></q>
When we were discussing the previous amendments, the Minister said that he did not want to get Clause 14 of the Bill on all fours with Section 29 of the Finance Act 1965 because capital gains tax and development land tax were not the same sort of tax. Nevertheless, he made some concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a matter of hard fact, subsection (4) of Clause 14, as drafted, is similar to Section 29(5) of the Finance Act 1965. Section 29 imposes a liability to capital gains tax on the sale of a private residence if any part of the house has been claimed as an office by a businessman in proportion to the amount he has claimed. Many right hon. and hon. Members who have worked in a self-employed capacity from their home will know what is involved. It is open to the taxpayer to elect that part of his house should be treated as an office, and the Revenue will then be prepared to consider claims for lighting, heating and so on in proportion to his office expenses. But, of course, the 	<i>quid pro quo</i> for that is that when one comes to sell the house at the end of the day, because one has claimed the exemption for, say, one's front sitting-room as being one's office, one must pay capital gains tax on that section of the sale which represents the proportion that was for one's office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a perfectly reasonable situation, and so is the principle of subsection (4). But our amendment goes further than the capital gains tax rules because development land tax is at a much higher rate than capital gains tax. We would give an exemption for everyone who had not claimed income tax relief on more than one-fifth of the cubic capacity of the property during the time that he had worked there. This is not only intended as a concession because of the rate of DLT
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>864</span>
being higher than capital gains tax; it is also intended as a 	<i>de minimis</i> provision. If it is not inserted into the Bill, either with the fraction of one-fifth or some other fraction—I am not necessarily wedded to that figure—if a person claims for the use of a study in his private house, as I have so described, he will have to carry out a calculation for the purposes of development land tax when the house is sold, although there may easily be no liability at all. That will create unnecessary administrative burdens for both the Revenue and the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that what we are proposing goes further than the existing provisions for capital gains tax, but it does so for the two provisions I have outlined: first, the fact that the rates of tax are entirely different and, secondly, it is a 	<i>de minimis</i> provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seeks to amend Clause 14 to exclude from a charge for development land tax an area that is used by a person in his house for trade or business up to one-fifth of the cubic capacity of the entire dwelling-house. As he has fairly stated, he is seeking to extend a relief further than capital gains tax relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As drafted, the Bill re-emphasised and re-introduces the capital gains tax relief. In spite of what I have said previously, I do not think that it is illogical that we should include the same test as for capital gains tax because we are not concerned with the time apportionment proposals but with something quite different. I think it is only fair that if a person uses part of his dwelling house for business, professional or trade purposes then the only or main residence exemption for capital gains tax should be denied to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that such a person would get income tax relief on any expenses incurred on that part of the dwelling-house used for professional purposes—always a very nice calculation, I should have thought in some cases, whether to claim income tax relief and lose the capital gains tax exemption.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But we are concerned here with development land tax. I accept that it is at a higher rate, but there is a higher profit, too, in the sense that it is a windfall profit—the profit over and above the normal profit. I do not think that the one-fifth area could be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1033">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>865</span>
We already have a 	<i>de minimis</i> provision, if that is the way to describe it, in the £10,000 exemption. The hon. Gentleman wants us to go further, but I think that the provision is fair. In most cases there will be no tax payable. A calculation would sometimes have to be made, if the amendment were accepted, where it would not be necessary, but in other cases it might still be necessary to make a calculation if there is only the one figure of exemption. I do not think it is a major problem. There might be a few cases where the administrative burden would be slightly greater by not accepting the amendment, but in practice I do not think it would make very much difference. I think it would be unfair and illogical to accept the amendment. We have provided tile very substantial exemption of £10,000 for main residences, even if there is development value, and I should have thought in those sorts of cases there would be no tax to be paid anyway because of the two exemptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the Minister cannot accept the amendment or something like it. I can see that one-fifth of a very large dwelling house might be too much and not 	<i>de minimis.</i> But one could put a limit on the one-fifth if necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think the proposal would be of great administrative help and to say that the allowance has already been made for this is not accurate. It is true that allowance has been made to everybody for the £10,000 slice. Allowance has been made for everybody for their main residence. But allowance has not been made specifically for the problem of the person who is taking part of his house, and only a small part, for professional purposes. I pick out the word "professional" because it seems that that would be the most likely type of business for which part of the house would be used. I do not quite know what happens to the Member of Parliament whose secretary takes letters in one room of his home. Is that part use for business, or a profession, vocation or trade?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Profit or employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Profit or employment. It does seem a ridiculous position if we are to have the box-room assessed and apportioned out to the rest of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>866</span>
building. Surely in this case we can do away with apportionment where the amount of space used for trade purposes is so very small. I ask the Minister to look at the matter again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will look at the point carefully. We may get into a position where something is put on the statute book which is widely spoken about, but which is never enforced by the Revenue. In my experience of these matters the Revenue rarely charges capital gains tax where persons had used a room in their house for business purposes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe I am right in saying that there is an entirely anomalous position in relation to farmers. I do not have the case before me, but my recollection is that there has been a recently decided case which said that where a person lives in a farm house, which is surrounded by farm land, and carries out the administration and clerical work of the farm within the farm house generally and not within a particular identifiable room—I see some nods from those who know about these things—then the whole of the farm house may be described as the principal private residence notwithstanding the fact that a proportion of the expenses of the whole of the farm house are claimed as being business expenses because they are incurred in the administration and clerical work of the farm. It is much better to recognise that this is an anomaly and an area where the tax is never levied than to perpetuate this sort of double talk which necessarily goes on if we do not recognise the reality of the situation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know whether I should pursue the case of the farm house. I do not know of the case and cannot give an opinion on the matter. Subsection (4) refers to the dwelling-house as being

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>867</span>
his case might not come within the provisions of the subsection at all. But I think it tries to introduce some precision into the clause and that is why the word "exclusively" is used.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the point of the word "exclusively", does that mean that if I take my secretary into the bedroom and dictate letters to her there it will not be using any part of the premises for professional purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It depends on what the exclusive use is. I recognise that there may always be difficult cases, but I think the stipulation is reasonable and fair. If part of a house is set aside exclusively for a trade or business I think it is only fair and right that the person who does that should be charged the development land tax although with the exceptions I think it is very unlikely that he will be. I think it is illogical to pick an area of one-fifth because, as the right hon. Gentleman said, one-fifth could be a large area in some cases and very small in others. It is a very unfair 	<i>de minimis</i> to pick a fraction. At least if one picked a slice or a figure it might not be so unfair, but a one-fifth fraction is extremely unfair because of the different sizes of cubic capacity which could occur in these cases.

	<p>for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) said that the Revenue never made any charges for capital gains tax on these occasions. I was upset because, if he is right, I have missed a trick. At one stage I was actually in this position when I was acting as a sole trader and running a small consultancy business from my home. I deliberately did not charge the heating, lighting and so on of my sitting room, although it was my office, because I did not want to pay capital gains tax when I came to sell my house. I charged my telephone bill because my accountants advised me that that was all right. But if my hon. Friend is correct, I missed a trick. However, that is by the way. I assume that the law is actually in force, from what my hon. Friend says of it. I was disappointed by the Minister's reply. Next time he goes to dine at his Inn, he will get a dusty answer from his colleagues, who are barristers-at-law and who cannot afford to work in chambers, but work from their homes, and who will have to fill up DLT assessment forms in order to get a nil return when they sell their house because they have chosen to do some of their work from their homes.</p>
	<p>There is a point of principle here. I accept that it is not likely to be a major matter or that a large amount of tax will be involved—if any—but there is the matter of assessment and the bureaucracy which is involved. The committee, therefore, should come to a decision on this matter.</p>
	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 10.</p>
	<p>the circumstances change in the methods as defined in paragraphs (	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>). That is fair enough and no one would want to quarrel with that. I have no quarrel with paragraph (	<i>a</i>), but paragraph (	<i>b</i>) adds the stipulation that the relief can also be adjusted:
	<br><q><p>"within the period of twenty-four months ending at the time of the disposal".</p></q></p>

	<p>My hon. Friends and I were far from satisfied that we knew what those words were supposed to mean. To some extent, I treat this as a probing amendment. I could understand it if the provision ended from the time of the disposal or with the time of disposal, but that it should end at the time of the disposal appears to be entirely covered by the provisions of paragraph (	<i>a</i>)—that is to say, within the period of ownership.</p>
	<p>Could the Minister tell us what paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is meant to mean and in what way it differs from the situation in paragraph(	<i>a</i>)?</p>
	<p>11.45 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks me a question in relation to paragraph (	<i>b</i>). He indicated that his amendment to some extent is consequential on the others with which we have already dealt. His specific question related to what paragraph (	<i>b</i>) meant. Paragraph (	<i>b</i>) is designed to deal with a situation where ownership is of less than two years and the normal test is ownership for two years or more. But where there is ownership for less than two years, paragraph (	<i>b</i>), which states that he must have occupied the house for at least half that period or a period of six months, whichever is the greater, applies. So if total ownership is less than two years occupation must have been for at least half that period, or six months, should that be the greater. If there is a drafting problem—and when I first read it, I found it difficult to understand, and I appreciate that it may still seem so to some people—we shall look at it again to see whether we can clarify the situation and say exactly what we mean. The intention of what we mean to say is clear, but if there is some difficulty we will look again at the drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On Amendment No. 152, subsection (6) extends the owner-occupied exemption to settled land disposed of by trustees. The amendment seeks merely to put the Bill in line with the words in page 3 of the explanatory booklet. On page 19 of the booklet the words in the legislation are repeated. However, there seem to be arguments in favour of the words in the booklet and of the amendment because the individual may not be entitled under the terms of the settlement to occupy the dwellinghouse, but may be one of a number of persons who may be allowed to occupy the dwelling-house. In such circumstances the trustees may permit that person to live in the dwelling-house, particularly by agreement with other potential occupiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would have thought that that was a perfectly possible scenario, to use that fashionable, modern word, and certainly it requires to be covered in the Bill, as drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Amendment No. 326, under the terms of the provisions as drafted, the person must be entitled to the whole of the income from the trust, which effectively excludes those trusts in which more than one person has an interest in possession or those in which the beneficiaries have only discretionary rights, dependent upon the exercise of the discretion by trustees. Many cases occur where two or more persons may have an interest in a trust. They may also be interested in the income derived from a dwelling-house. For example, I am advised that there are cases where a property has been left to three sisters and a brother and where one sister occupies part of the property and the remainder is let. In such a case, the property included an area which could be treated as an individual's private residence, if the individual had occupied the property and owned it outright, but as the property was owned by the trustees the provisions of paragraph (	<i>b</i>) are contrary to those in subsection (6) (	<i>a</i>) in these circumstances. That seems unreasonable and the amendment would not seem to open unduly any particular avoidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that we are dealing with amendments relating to trusts, particularly

those relating to discretionary trusts—and my son is a beneficiary of a discretionary trust from my wife's gradmother's will, or something like that, but the sum involved is not likely to disturb the revenue. There are no doubt, possibilities for avoidance. Some trusts are established solely for the purposes of avoidance, and there is nothing illegal or immoral about that. The taxpayer is not required to pay a penny more than the statute requires. In the cases which I have described, I hope that the Minister will see that there is a possibility of unfairness and that he will feel able to look sympathetically at the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) candidly pointed out that discretionary trusts give the possibility of avoidance, with which legislation must be able to deal. This covers one of the two amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like first to deal with Amendment No. 152. We are dealing with the sale by trustees, and in order to avoid liability for DLT, it must satisfy the major consideration in subsection (6) (	<i>a</i>), namely, that it must be a private residence, which we already know. It also has to satisfy two particular qualifications under paragraph (	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first qualification is that the beneficiary has been using it as a private residence—that he must be in residence in the property concerned. Furthermore—and this relates to the second part of paragraph (	<i>b</i>)—he must be a beneficiary under the settlement and as a result be entitled to the total proceeds or the income, in other words, he must have the complete monetary interest in that particular property. The amendment deals with the person who is allowed to occupy those particular premises but is not actually resident in them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I see the situation, if the individual occupies the property concerned, it meets the condition (	<i>a</i>). As a result of this, I should have thought that the amendment would not be necessary. That is all I need say at this stage on Amendment No. 152.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will now deal with Amendment No. 326, which covers the particular point made by the hon. Gentleman in the example that he selected for discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment covers the case of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>872</span>
beneficiary who is entitled under the particular trust settlement to part only of the income or the proceeds of the sale of that house. The whole of this part of the legislation is directed towards an exemption of private residence—and we are talking in simple language—which is essentially for owner occupiers of homes. It is a provision for owner-occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A person who has a beneficial interest in part only of that property is not normally considered as the owner-occupier. We must consider the avoidance point raised by the hon. Gentleman with great candour. What happens if that interest is minimal? What if that interest were not half or a third? What if it were some minor interest? We then open the question of avoidance. Therefore, with those points in mind I cannot ask the Committee to accept either of the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an appropraite point at which to try to clear up a point which puzzles me about subsection (6) which refers to settled property. I presume that means strict settlement and not where the property is given to trustees for sale, with permission to the trustees to allow a beneficiary to live in the house. That was what we had in mind in using the words "allowed or entitled".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be various types of settlement which do not give the beneficiary or the tenant for life the right to live in a particular property as his residence, but gives to the trustees the power to allow that to be done. I should have thought, logically, that one should give relief to such a person. Frequently one provides for the matrimonial home to be put in trust for the widow. It may be by means of a strict settlement or trust for sale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the practical point of view, there is not much difference. The widow remains in the house and may not be entitled to do so. Perhaps the testator, who is giving power to the trustees to ask her to move out of the house, sees that they should get vacant possession under those circumstances. There is little logical distinction between being entitled, in having a right to reside in the house, and being permitted to reside in it by the trustees. That is the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second point relates to the question of whether the person is disqualified if some small amount of the income derived from the estate does not belong to the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1037">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>873</span>
individual with whom we are concerned here, the person residing in the house. It seems to me very unfair if in those circumstances, the individual is to be deprived of the benefit of this subsection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am puzzled about the alternative in paragraph (	<i>b</i>). The Financial Secretary explained clearly that it is an alternative that one has to prove first, under paragraph (	<i>a</i>), that it is a private residence. Secondly, one has the alternative of proving that the individual, as the clause is drafted, is entitled to occupy the dwelling-house; or, as an alternative is entitled to the whole of the income derived from the proceeds of sale of that interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the slightest proportion of that income goes to somebody else—or even if the beneficiaries' interest in it is only for a limited period—that individual would be deprived of the benefit of the provision. It is difficult to understand, and I think there will be considerable hardship if it is left as it is drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Melton would agree with me. We are not satisfied that we have got exactly the right wording to meet these hardships, but as the debate has gone at present the Financial Secretary does not recognise that there may be hardships in these cases which we should try to relieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I might add a little, though I regret not very much, to what I said previously, perhaps I might give the right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr Page) the meaning of "settled property" and its definition. In Clause 29 it means a strict settlement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thought Clause 29 related only to Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12 noon.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I think this is the general definition of "settled property". But perhaps I might deal with Amendment No. 326, because it is here that we are talking about part only of the income, or the money in total relating to the financial interest in the property. If this amendment were to be carried, it could mean that the means of avoidance would become much wider because it would be very hard to know what "part only" would refer to. It could be a trivial interest, through which a large amount of development land
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>874</span>
tax or considerable amounts of development land tax, could be lost. Since we have established the general desire to remove as many loopholes as we can from the avoidance provision, it is necessary for this provision to remain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In regard to the other point on Amendment No. 152 and the further comments made by the right hon. Member for Crosby, who was right to draw our attention to this matter, I wish to deal with the case of the private residence which the beneficiary has been using as a private residence and which means that he has to be there on the spot. If that is the situation, we are giving this relief for such owner occupation, and the matter needs to be seen in that light because of the general commitments undertaken by both parties over the years to assist such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are meeting the point of the individual who is in occupation because he does meet that condition (	<i>a</i>) in taking over an interest in the whole or part of the individual's private residence. Not only is it a private residence, but it includes the whole or any part of the individual's private residence. That means that we have all the cases that might have to be considered here. If the individual occupies—and this is the point of the amendment put by the hon. Member for Melton—he meets condition (	<i>a</i>) and the amendment would subsequently not be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important part of this legislation because rightly there has been a great deal of concern about such people. I should like to satisfy that concern and I hope that what I have said may help to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for that further explanation. I think my worry cannot be settled by these amendments and we shall have to consider whether we can bring in a trust for sale as well as settled property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I correctly understand paragraph (	<i>b</i>) as drafted, the individual must have a right under the terms of the settlement to occupy the dwelling or else have the right to create that right. He is entitled to the whole of the income, and therefore he can dictate whether he lives there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are still left with the fact that a little bit of the income may be going somewhere else, and he might be deprived of that. I think we should all like to look at this matter again. It is a complicated position
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1038">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>875</span>
and it may well be that when we reach Clause 29 we would wish to try to bring in trusts for sale with settled property. One would then have to reconsider subsection (6).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been extremely useful in bringing out a number of points. Thanks to the Financial Secretary, I understand it a little better now than I did when I first read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to thank the Financial Secretary, and I also thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby for displaying his formidable intellect and knowledge of the law of trust to the Committee, thus enabling the Government to think again about these matters. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 115, in page 21, line 21, after 'person', insert 'or a beneficiary of the estate of a deceased person'.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with this amendment, Mr. Fitch. By subsection (7) relief is available to heirs who dispose of a house within two years of the deceased's death. This amendment would extend this concession to the beneficiaries of the estate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not a lawyer nor an expert in this kind of law, and it may well be that the Minister will say that the existing words are adequate to cover the point. I am prepared to accept his guidance on that matter. But the question of the beneficiaries of an estate is important and if the existing wording covers the matter, I shall withdraw the amendment. But perhaps it may be treated as a probing amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is that the existing words do not cover the sale by a beneficiary. We have discussed this matter before in connection with other amendments moved by the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) who sought a £40,000 limit. The clause as drafted enables the sale by the personal representatives within two years of the death of the deceased to benefit from the principle or the main residence exemption which would have been available to the deceased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are asked to extend that exemption to a sale by a beneficiary who has received the house from the personal representative on the distribution of the estate. If the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>876</span>
beneficiary lives in the house and it is his main residence, he receives the main residence exemption and there is no problem. I take it that the situation to which the hon. Gentleman referred is in the case where a beneficiary does not live in a house but sells it, having received the house 	<i>in specie</i> from the personal representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have debated this matter before. I do not think the suggested course would be fair, given the fact that we are concerned with an exemption which relates to a main residence. If it is a beneficiary's main residence, the exemption applies. If it is not the beneficiary's main residence, the exemption does not apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman earlier said that the situation might be unfair in some circumstances because a personal representative may distribute the house to the beneficiary who did not want the house and it would then be sold. I suggested on that occasion that personal representatives do not normally operate in that way. They are under an obligation to look at the taxation position of beneficiaries before they distribute the estate. In practice, that should not be a problem. As this is a main residence exemption, we could not give it to a beneficiary where the house was not the beneficiary's main residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: So be it. We have been over this ground before. I do not think there is any need to pursue it further now. I do not wish to press the amendment and I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 324, in page 22, line 12, after 'possession', insert

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we are to take Amendment No. 325, in page 22, line 17, at end add—
	<br><q><p>'(11) Where a dwelling-house has been an individual's only or main residence within the meaning of subsection (3) of this section, and he has acquired another dwelling-house for his only or main residence, without prejudice to the latter residence being treated as his only or main residence for the purposes of this section, the former residence shall continue to be treated as his only or main residence for a period of twelve months from the date on which he entered into possession of the latter residence or such longer period as the Commissioners shall on appeal allow'.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>877</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendment No. 324 may be considered to be a paving amendment to Amendment No. 325. We are here suggesting that relief for the house should continue to be available for 12 months after someone has moved into another house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand the position, the acquisition of a property makes it one's only or main residence from the date of the contract and not necessarily from the date at which one enters into possession—for example, on completion. Such a situation might occur on the disposal of a farm where completion and occupation tend to change in the autumn rather than at other times of the year, and also in the case of houses dealt with under Amendment No. 325.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems right and proper that the person should be able to treat as his main residence one which he can enter into possession within the next 12 months, as suggested in both Amendments Nos. 324 and 325, where he might not have the right to immediate possession under the terms of the contract.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all know that all sorts of difficulties may occur between exchange of contract and completion. If I might add a personal note, these matters are important where the market turns difficult. It is desirable, so far as possible, to harmonise the dates of completion with the sale of one's own property and the purchase of another. Every sensible vendor attempts to do the two transactions simultaneously, but that is not always possible. We know that bridging loans may be required or that a sale may fall through. In those circumstances the 12 months' relief, which we are suggesting, would be a real easement in such difficult circumstances as the disposal of the farm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will look sympathetically at these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman moved the amendments briefly, but I think he will recognise that they are difficult amendments. I do not completely understand what they are asking for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the drafting of the legislation the words "right to … possession" occur in subsection (10) on page 22, where a period of ownership is treated as the beginning of the time at which an individual acquires that interest or any other interest conferring on him the right to immediate possession. When a contract
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>878</span>
is signed, the person is acquiring that interest in land. There is no question of his relying on the other limb, as it were, to establish the right to immediate possession. Once a contract has been exchanged, he has acquired an interest and he comes into the first limb of subsection 10 (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The following words which relate to an interest conferring on him the right of immediate possession relate to the kind of situation where I may acquire the lease and later acquire the freehold and, of course, the lease and the freehold merge. Those later words ensure that when I dispose of the property, the acquisition of the lease is the acquisition involved and not the acquisition of the freehold, although of course I shall be disposing of the freehold. I hope that is not too complicated, but in the normal case where we are exchanging contracts, the words "right to immediate possession", I am advised, do not apply here because the person has acquired an interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern was expressed that there may be some difficulty in cases where a person acquires a new property and cannot dispose of his previous property. This may cause him to lose some of the exemptions under the legislation because he has moved from one property into another. This was a common occurrence during the so-called property boom which ceased to be a property boom when people bought but could not sell, and there were certain concessions in capital gains tax. I imagine that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) had to deal with some difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With DLT the problem is not likely to arise a great deal, because if I own property which has development value in the shape of planning permission, or likely planning permission, I shall not have difficulty in selling it because the very essence of the matter, if there is development value, and it is worth something, is that somebody will buy it. Therefore, we shall not have the same kind of situation as we saw during the problems of the past few years in relation to property in general.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, I do not know whether there is likely to be a problem here. I am not sure and cannot make up my mind about it. My advice is that there will not be a problem, another reason being the 12 months' period which could be allowed in certain circumstances because of the 24 months' period of ownership.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1040">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>879</span>
Without making any commitment at all, because I am advised that there is not likely to be a problem, I am prepared to explore the matter to see whether there might be some difficulty in practice which might create some harsh results. I do not think it will, and I hope the Committee is prepared to accept my assurance that we will look into it to see whether there might be any hardship.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We accept the Minister's assurance, but I wish he had committed himself a little further, because there really is a problem here. I became a little more confused as he went on with his speech. I thought that I had got the hang of it to start off with, but the situation is quite simply this. Under capital gains tax, where there is the election of one's main residence, when moving from one residence to another without selling the first, one did have the choice to say that the former was one's main residence, that it had not been sold and that one was not still living there. It still is one's main residence and perhaps one could go to and fro in order to keep it so. This is a problem, because we are splitting the ownership of the occupation again without any right of election as one has under capital gains tax. I think that, having rejected the right of election, on which I partially went along with the Minister, we have to provide for some form of coping with it under this clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think I understood the Minister correctly when he said that once one has signed a contract and acquired an interest it does not necessarily mean that one is entitled to immediate possession.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that it did not really matter, because we were within the legislation anyway by exchanging the contract. An interest in land had been acquired and the time period ran from that point. It was not necessary to decide whether there was a right to immediate possession, because more favourable conditions applied on the exchange of contract and the time ran from them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again we are splitting the ownership of the occupation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is the solution?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot see the solution at the moment. We will have to look at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>880</span>
this again very carefully. We have to make provision, and see that it is satisfactory and not creating hardship, where there is a change of residence and where it may well be impossible to dispose of the previous residence quickly. There may be this break between ownership and occupation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the Minister has said that he is going to look at it without commitment, I hope that he has seen the difficulties over this, particularly the fact of having rejected election in development land tax, and that we really have to make provision for the case of a change of residence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is not a dull matter of argument between lawyers—I do not mean the two lawyers sitting in this room I mean a dull legal point. We are dealing, with a real situation which might emerge here, of somebody having a liability to capital gains tax at a time when he has bought a house and not succeeded in disposing of another. Of course I accept all the reservations, the £10,000 slice exemption, and so on. But just because quite a lot of money is involved, does not mean to say that the taxpayer should receive any less consideration. The issue here is the principle, not the level of tax to be paid. I am grateful to the Minister for saying that he would look at this matter again. I appreciate that he did not make any commitments, but that is good enough, and I shall not press the matter further. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause stand part of the Bill.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very full discussion on the amendments to Clause 14 and I think we have probably covered every point. But when we look at the amendments which the Minister says he will bring forward later and the assurances which he has given, we may find that there are other points we want to consider. Therefore, if I do not raise a long discussion now or pick out items in the clause, I hope that I shall not be accused in future that I let it slip past without any debate. We shall have to think about it before the next stage, and we shall be thinking about it with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1041">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>881</span>
happy hearts, as the Minister said he will bring forward some amendments. We look forward to seeing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support my right hon. Friend. When we were discussing Amendment No. 147 I mentioned the importance of the one-acre provision, and the Minister kindly said that he would look at the question of allowing discretion to the commissioners in the circumstances. That is much appreciated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a builder, I say again that a great deal of land comes forward from small sites, particularly involving the infilling of land where an old Victorian house has been knocked down and some new development takes place in the garden of that house. This is a very important matter for the housing programme and nothing must be done in any way to deter that land coming forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again I accept there is the 66⅔per cent. exemption for three years, the £10,000 slice and so on. But I take the opportunity to stress yet again the need for these small parcels of land to be brought readily on to the market for in-filling, particularly in rural areas, such as I represent, where the planners are not prepared to allow the size of the village envelope to be extended, but are sometimes prepared to allow in-filling to take place. I hope that the Minister, when he brings forward his amendment, will bear this thought in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN DWELLING-HOUSES BUILT FOR OWNER OCCUPATION, ETC.</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 145, in page 22, line 19, after 'disposal', insert
	<br><q><p>'or the disposal by way of gift or for a consideration less than the full market value or as a result of a death or in the circumstances described in section 14(6) above'.</p></q>
We now move to a rather different form of exemption, that is, exemption for certain dwelling-houses built for owner-occupation. I shall have more to say about that when we deal with Amendment No. 143.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this amendment we are concerned with the provisions of by whom the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>882</span>
deemed disposal takes place. Clause 15(1) states:
	<br><q><p>"Subject to the provisions of this section, on the deemed disposal of an interest in land … development land tax shall not be chargeable "</p></q>
After the word "disposal" we want to insert "the actual disposals"—so to speak—which take place in the circumstances defined in the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "actual" disposals, it will be noted, in every case are slightly unusual disposals—that is, they are disposals of a type described, for example, in Clause 10, by way of a gift or a consideration of less than market value—and we discussed this at some length on Clause 10—or as the result of a death, which is covered in Clause 12, and in the circumstances described in Clause 14(6) about which we have just been talking and which is clearly set out in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are trying to widen slightly the scope of the exemptions. I shall endeavour to suggest, when we come to the next amendment, that we think this method of approaching the matter is wrong. In any case it, is of a complex and unsatisfactory nature. However, we believe that the methods of disposal which we describe in Amendment No. 145—which are not, of course, ordinary open market value sales, but are of a completely different nature—are deserving of the exemption under Clause 15 where they do not accrue it from some other reason.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) introduced this amendment by talking about the main purpose of the clause. He is right in that the clause excludes from the development land tax certain development for home ownership. The exemption will apply, irrespective of the size of plot, for the building of two new houses if one is built within the curtilage of a house which was owned on 12th September 1974. The intention behind the amendment is that it would apply exemption not only to the deemed disposal but to actual disposal. On the face of it, this is not an unreasonable amendment until one goes into it a little further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A deemed disposal means that when the owner of the land provides for the building of a dwelling-house for his family or a brother or sister, this will not be liable to the development land tax. At the time when the deemed disposal is made, it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1042">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>883</span>
known exactly what is to happen to that particular plot of land: the precise nature of the development is known. However, when one is dealing with a disposal by means of gift, or at less than market valuation, that information is not yet known. The land is passed over and it is not known what is to happen there. Subsequently, it may be that several houses are going to be built on that land. Under this amendment, they would, of course, be exempt from the development land tax. Clearly, the amendment is unacceptable if it has that particular consequence, and I assure hon. Gentlemen that it will have it because the actual development will not be known. Therefore, although on the face of it, it seems a not unreasonable amendment, I am unable to accept it because of these factors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is obviously a division between us. I think there is some considerable merit in what the Financial Secretary has said. I can see difficulties in the amendment. In fact, we want to deal with the whole matter of Clause 15 in a rather different way, which is contained in Amendment No. 143 and linked amendments.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 142, in page 22, line 24, leave out paragraph (	<i>a</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Amendment No. 142, we have in mind the operative date 12th September 1974. Indeed, it would have been possible for us to have put down an amendment to delete that date altogether, but as that is unlikely to appeal to the Minister either, it does not really matter whether we put down amendments to delete the whole paragraph or to delete the date. However, it is the date to which we take exception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps I ought to say for the record that the situation under the Bill, as drafted, is that the Government intend that no development land tax shall be chargeable when a person builds a dwelling-house for occupation by himself or an adult member of his family on land owned by him on 12th September 1974. I am sure that I am right in saying that very similar words
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>884</span>
occurred in the original draft of the Community Land Act. I shall have more to say about that on the next amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government originally wanted the Standing Committee considering the Community Land Bill to accept a series of propositions very similar to that which is at present drafted in Clause 15. Eventually, they were persuaded that that was not the right way to proceed, and they produced an entirely different procedure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see no reason why the date 12th September 1974 should be in the Bill for the purposes of development land tax. I say that because of the use of the word "owned". I would not have agreed with them, but I could have understood it, if the Government had come forward and said "We are prepared to accept a situation by which there will be no relief if a person built a house for which there was planning permission on 12th September 1974". That would be quite clear. It would not have been a proposition that I would have accepted, but it would have been intellectually defensible. But that is not what they say. What they say is that the man will only have had to own the land on 12th September 1974, irrespective of when he actually chooses to exercise his option. Therefore, in a sense, it is more generous than the provision which I suggested would have been more logical.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, because it is more generous, I can then proceed by Morton's fork to the second point of my argument, namely, that if they are prepared to grant that concession—a concession which can, in fact, be implemented by the taxpayer at any time in the future, given the fact only that he owned the land on 12th September 1974—why is it necessary to have the date at all? If it is conceded that it is right for a citizen within the limits of his own land to build a dwelling-house for himself, which is what we are concerned with here—rather than the uncles and the cousins and the aunts to whom I shall come in a moment—at any time in the future, irrespective of when planning permission was obtained, it seems to me all the more reason why one should simply say "We do not need this date. It does not matter when he actually buys the land; if he is only building one house for himself, we will give him the exemption from development land tax just as we give to the taxpayer now exemption from the tax if he sells his ordinary house under the pro-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1043">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>885</span>
visions of Clause 14".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One would then be saying that the State does not wish to concern itself with the taxation under development land tax of a person who wishes to build a house for his own occupation. The date itself is of no direct relevance. It happens to relate solely to the White Paper on land—a White Paper which bears little relationship to what actually found its way on to the statute book in the form of the Community Land Act. Indeed, the development land tax was not described in that White Paper at all. Therefore, I believe that the date is becoming increasing irrelevant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman will doubtless say "We must have a date, otherwise there will be evasion. We will have individual plots all over the country on which they will choose to build individual houses and this will be a serious abuse". I do not think that that is necessarily so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, if it was likely to be an abuse, it would be possible for the Government to bring forward an amendment whereby one taxpayer could enjoy this benefit only once. A friend of mine once said about democracy "She should be one-man, one-vote once". That proposition has never attracted me, but taxpayers should be able to enjoy this benefit once and not umpteen times round the country, rather than saying that he can enjoy it only if he was lucky enough to own a piece of land on 12th September 1974.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a matter on which I could dilate at considerable length, Mr. Fitch, but I hope that I have said enough to show the right hon. Gentleman that, once he accepted the principle that the land was not necessarily in a condition to be built on on 12th September 1974 because it did not need to have planning permission, it is only a small step to saying that the date itself is unimportant and what matters is that the man is building a house for himself, rather than when he actually owned the land. That would be a perfectly reasonable extension and, if the Minister wants to try to close loopholes by saying that the taxpayer can use that exemption only once, that would meet the objection that he may wish to put forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.30 p.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman takes exception to the date. The point that he makes here, has not been made in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>886</span>
previous debates where the date has been questioned. On those occasions, alternative dates have been suggested as being more suitable. Here, we are concerned with the removing of the date, and I understand the Government's purpose. He pointed out in his example that the relief could have been made applicable where planning permission had been obtained but that we had been more generous than that and ownership only was required. I accept that and it is a tribute to the way in which we have tried to proceed with this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Here, however, we are concerned with the building of a house for occupation by the owner or by a member of his family, a question that we will later debate in more detailed terms. The provision that one should have owned land on 12th September before one could make the disposal is a straightforward means of ensuring that the operation of this exemption does not get out of control. If the building of a house for occupation by an owner or member of his family were permitted without any limitation on the date of ownership, nothing would prevent such an owner of land from making provision for the building of a house for one member of his family, then proceeding to purchase more land and building on that for another member of his family. There are a number of large families in our midst who could all be provided, by means of this amended legislation, with dwellinghouses on which no development land tax would be payable. This could go on indefinitely in the way that I have described.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I greatly regret that I cannot accept this provision. On the more limited point—I think the hon. Gentleman mentioned one only—of the building of the house for occupation by the owner, I should like to look further at that point to see if there is any way in which we might be able to meet at least part of the requirements of the amendment. I make no commitment. but I think that I would like to look further into that point. The general provisions of this amendment, however, I cannot ask the Committee to accept.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will not have escaped the attention of the Minister that this is a fairly drastic amendment as, to all intents and purposes, it would gut the clause. That does not make it a wrecking amendment, Mr. Fitch, or naturally you would not have selected it. But it tries to show that the whole uncles, cousins and aunts provisions are ones which we find extremely unsatisfactory. I take up the point which I said earlier I would come to when we reached this stage. Those of us who had the privilege and doubtful pleasure of serving on the Standing Committee dealing with the Community Land Bill will realise that we are back in familiar waters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Community Land Bill was originally drafted, there was an identical provision—I do not say identical in words, but certainly identical in spirit—
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>888</span>
in, I think, Clause 4, although I am open to correction by my right hon. Friends encyclopaedic memory, which attempted to give exemptions from the community land scheme—that is, from either the right after the first appointed day or the duty after the second appointed day, of the local authorities to acquire land, an exemption for an individual who had built a house within the curtilege of his garden, which subsequently became two houses within the curtilege of his garden for named relatives. In Committee on the Community Land Bill the Opposition made a number of points about this, showing that it was an unnecessarily bureaucratic procedure and, in the end, the Government rightly decided that they would think about the whole matter again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At a later stage of the Bill, though I cannot remember if it was on Report here or in another place—perhaps it was in both places, as the Government changed their mind on several occasions on this matter—they brought forward a completely different definition entirely dropping all the uncles, cousins and aunts business, and produced instead what is now Section 3 of the Community Land Act, where under subsection (2)(	<i>b</i>) "relevant development" specifically excludes development,
	<br><q><p>"consisting exclusively of the building of a single dwelling-house, and (	<i>c</i>) development of such class or classes as may be prescribed by the Secretary of State by regulations"</p></q>
So the whole business in the Community Land Bill about uncles, cousins and aunts was turfed out and a much neater formula put in which dealt better with the problem. The trouble with Clause 15 which goes back to what I can only call the unreconstructed Community Land Bill, is that it allows one to have a great deal of debate about which relatives should receive this particular sanction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen), is prevented from being with us at this moment. He would recall that during the Committee Stage of the Community Land Bill I made the point—and he supported me—that, whereas to us the family structure is quite clear and these named relatives will be regarded as a reasonable extension of the family situation, this is not necessarily so, for example, in the Pakistani or Indian family situation, where the relationships and family structure are entirely different. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1045">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>889</span>
said that the family structure would need to be taken into account in the Bill as it was then drafted. It has not been taken into account in this Bill as drafted, either.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we seek to do one of two things. The first is to cut the exemptions out altogether and to proceed instead on a neater basis by which the Government could simply exclude the building of two such dwellinghouses—that, I think, was eventually decided with regard to the Community Land Act. Secondly, if that approach fails to persuade the Minister, we suggest in Amendments Nos. 146, 330 and 207 a series of other relationships which would be appropriate and, in fact, it begins to read like the table of kindreds and affinity in the Book of Common Prayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I need to develop this point at any greater length, Mr. Fitch. The Minister's advisers will be aware of our long discussions on the Community Land Bill about this matter. I simply suggest to the Minister that, rather than proceed with what I believe is an unnecessarily cumbersome procedure, he go back to the final wording of the Community Land Act and simply give an exclusion for two houses built within the curtilage of a dwelling-house.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman dealt partly with these points on the previous amendment, and my hon. Friend gave an undertaking that he would look at them, although without commitment. The hon. Gentlemen is right in saying that this clause arises from the Community Land Act and from the changes made to its drafting when it was in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the present position in the Community Land Act is that Clause 3(2)(	<i>b</i>) excludes that other statement, "the building of a single dwelling-house". I take it that there is no reference there to a single dwelling-house for the purpose of occupation by the person building. It is not a main residence exemption for a do-it-yourself builder. The Community Land Act makes exemptions almost wider, in the sense that anybody who builds one house is outside the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will recognise that point, however understanding we might be of some of his arguments, I find this clause difficult too, and can see some of its anomalies. I do not think he can
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>890</span>
really expect the same kind of exemption for the Community Land Act as for the Development Land Tax Bill, as we could merely have a situation where people could split up the building of houses and each building get a complete exemption from development land tax, regardless of the fact that that house was built to be somebody's main residence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, we are dealing with two different situations and, if we were to include that kind of provision, we should need to have very complicated anti-avoidance provisions to prevent the kind of splitting-up which might happen in order to avoid the development land tax on each building of each single dwelling. So whatever might be the outcome of this matter being looked at again, we could not go that far, as it could create a different situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also made a fair point as to why an exemption should be given for a pre-12th September 1974 plot of land, even where that land had not received planning permission, asking, "Why deny the exemption to a post-12th September plot of land?" I could go along some way with him on that point, but again it does not make complete sense. He then said that if the provision remains as it is, he would seek to press his amendments to extend the family affinity to include other people who might also be as deserving of this kind of exemption as those included now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also suggested that possibly, if we were to drop 12th September 1974, he would drop his demand to extend, or, indeed, to include any family affinity and leave it to a kind of do-it-yourself man building a house for himself.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I did not suggest that. If I appeared to suggest it, I did not intend to, but I suspect the Minister may have misheard me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman did not say it I will not pursue the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 143 would remove the requirement that the house had been intended for occupation by the owner or an adult member of his family, which follows the Community Land Act provision that if a house was built by a person, he must have the benefit for a single house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1046">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>891</span>
I think I have explained that it would not be possible to go along that road because we are dealing with two pieces of legislation. It would lead to enormous avoidance and difficulty. It would be easier in practice to build one house, and to get exemption for that, then to build another house and get the exemption for that, and so on 	<i>ad infinitum.</i> We have introduced very complicated anti-avoidance provisions to try to deal with these matters, so I regret I cannot support Amendment No. 143.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned some other amendments which extend the relationship to cover grandparents, great-grandparents, spouses of sons and daughters, and the dependent relative of the owner in another case, under Amendment No. 330. Again, once one accepts some kind of provision along these lines, I do not think we can go much further than the provisions of the legislation. We are under some difficulty. We both recognise that this matter is not entirely satisfactory. It is extremely difficult to frame a proposal which is more satisfactory without, on the one hand, creating pitfalls, and, on the other hand, making it too restrictive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, because this is a further exemption, I cannot include the other provisions the hon. Gentleman mentioned, except possibly that relating to dependent relatives of the owner. I previously accepted that suggestion in principle, and it would only be logical and right to accept it here also, subject to looking at the drafting, but hopefully putting the same kind of definition on it as appears in the capital gains tax legislation. Apart from that, in the circumstances, I cannot accept the other amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to press this matter, particularly Amendment No. 143. This subject was well and fully argued in the Community Land Bill Committee. There is not all that distinction between the Community Land Act and the Development Land Tax Bill. It is true that in one case one was dealing with the compulsory acquisition and eventually the duty to acquire under the Community Land Act. Here we are dealing with a tax, but we are dealing also with an exemption provided by Clause 15 and, if one likes to call it such, it is a legal avoidance. There is no particular logic in having an exemption given under Clause 15, but it is a right and
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>892</span>
proper exemption for the purpose of expediency, because we wish this sort of development to take place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not wish the person who undertakes this sort of development to be deterred from it by a tax. It is an avoidance of the tax—an exemption—and, recognising it as such, I would not object, nor, I am sure, would my hon. Friend the Member for Melton (Mr. Latham), if a limit were put on that avoidance. I can see that if one goes as far as the Community Land Act goes, of allowing the building of single dwelling-houses 	<i>ad infinitum</i> to escape tax, there would be too great an exemption from this tax. But when one restricts it to the complications of the family, there are too many marginal cases in which hardship might occur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have endeavoured, as my hon. Friend the Member for Melton said, to put down on the Order Paper fall-back amendments. But the more one devises such amendments and investigates the provisions of the Bill as drafted, the greater the number of anomalies one finds. The least anomalous is the one the principle of which the Minister has accepted, namely, a dependent relative of the owner, but there are other members of the family who may not be dependents but who are just as deserving as those set out in the clause as drafted. Perhaps I have put that the wrong way round. It is not necessarily the relative who is deserving. It is the meritorious intention of the owner when he is building that he should provide for his relatives and should not be discouraged from providing for them or his dependents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we have suggested certain alleviation of the clause as drafted, our real intention is to get rid of the clause altogether. The difficulties of any clause of this nature were fully recognised in debates on the Community Land Bill, and eventually the whole clause was removed. What my hon. Friend called the "uncles, cousins and aunts clause", even to the daughter-in-law-elect, was removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether we shall be able to persuade the Minister that the Minister for Planning and Local Government was correct in removing this sort of clause from the Community Land Bill, and that it should be removed from the Development Land Tax Bill, but I hope we can. It took a long debate to secure the removal of the clause from the Community Land Bill. I hope we do not have to go on debating
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1975-1976V009P0I1047">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>893</span>
this clause at such length in order to remove it from this Bill, but it is a matter on which the Opposition feel very strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think the Minister is right in saying that it opens the door to an immense amount of avoidance. It is not impossible to put a limit on it. The limit is put in some way in the clause itself in limiting it to two houses—I know that that is one of the subsections which is to come out. But merely to throw out the amendment on the ground that it opens the door to avoidance is asserting that the draftsman has not got the wit to put a limit to the amendment. In proposing the amendment, it is not for us to try to put a limit to it, but I do not believe it is impossible to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope the Minister will give us a little more hope on this clause and not return to what was originally in the Community Land Bill. I have a feeling that this clause must have been taken from the original draft of the Community Land Bill, that somebody forget it had been removed altogether from there and forgot to remove it from this Bill. If so, here is the opportunity to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not unsympathetic, as I tried to indicate in a gingerly way when I replied earlier. I accept a lot of what the right hon. Gentleman says about the anomalies. But I do not think he did complete justice to my point that if one were slavishly to follow the Community Land Act exemption there would be difficulties of avoidance. They are two different situations. The Community Land Act exemption to some extent was partly motivated for administrative reasons. It does not make sense to have a compulsory purchase procedure for one plot of land on which to build one house. In that kind of situation we exclude it from the Community Land Act. But there is a slightly different situation with taxation, in that we are concerned with tax in that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not unsympathetic, but I cannot see my way through at the moment, on the one hand to dispose of these anomalies and, on the other, to introduce something else which will not create tax avoidance problems. It may be that the best way to deal with the matter is to have some Community Land Act provision with a stop or a limit on it. I do not know whether it is possible to draft that kind of

provision. But I assure the hon. Gentleman that I understand the problems and I wish that we could go some way towards meeting the points that have been made.

But we also noted with pleasure that this morning the hon. Gentleman moved in a couple of minutes to the position to which it took the right hon. Gentleman about three months to move.

We have had these difficulties for capital gains tax purposes and we have dealt with them also in this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think we are moving far from the main reasons for the exemptions in the clause when we start giving exemptions to trustees who build houses for beneficiaries. There is a picture of Barclays' Bank Executor and Trustee company building a house for a beneficiary—a very attractive one—but I doubt whether normally it does this sort of thing. It may be that the right hon. Gentleman has been a trustee on numerous occasions. I do not know whether he has built any houses for beneficiaries. I think we are getting into territory which is not directly related to the purpose of the clause.

I accept that once we have this type of clause with exemptions for members of a family it is inevitable that an amendment of this type will be produced. I cannot accept the amendment because the whole general problem will be considered and looked at very carefully.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
