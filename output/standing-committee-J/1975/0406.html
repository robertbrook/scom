	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 69, in page 5, line 4, leave out 'as appears' and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'as shall be shown by the chargeable person'.</p></blockquote>
We have discussed the principle of this amendment on previous amendments and the Treasury Minister kindly gave us an undertaking that he would look at the matter again. It is similar to a previous amendment, and I will not labour it further. I only ask the Minister to look again at the amendment with the other similar amendments to see whether it can be accepted on the same basis as he accepted the principle of the previous amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Treasury (Mr. Denzil Davies)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) has referred to previous amendments and the undertaking that I gave. He will appreciate that the wording in subsection (4) is slightly different from previous wording, because we have been good boys in this respect and have actually put in the words—
	<br><blockquote><p>"…or, on an appeal, to the Commissioners…"</p></blockquote>
So the Board's discretion in this case is not absolute and there is provision for appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason, we think that the clause meets here the ligitimate points that the right hon. and hon. Members opposite made on the other amendments. Obviously when we consider these matters, we will also consider the point that the right hon. Gentleman raised in relation to this subsection. We think that we have met it in this case, however, but will take it into consideration when reviewing procedure on appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged to the Minister, but may I make it clear
	<span class='label label-info column'>332</span>
why this amendment was put on the Notice Paper. The words "as appears" seem to vovern the decision of the Board and also the decision of the Commissioners. The subsection says—
	<br><blockquote><p>"…as appears to the Board, or on an appeal"</p></blockquote>
as it appears to the Commissioners. The amendment is intended to point out that the appellant should be entitled to prove his case without it merely being the view of the Commissioners that he has proved the facts of the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am satisfied with the assurance that the Minister has given, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 70, in page 5, line 9, at end add:
	<br><blockquote><p>'other than as specifically provided under this Act'.</p></blockquote>
This is little more than a drafting amendment. Subsection (6), as it stands, says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In determining the amount of any realised development value for the purposes of this Act, no deduction shall be allowable under any provision of this Act more than once from any amount of rfom more than one amount".</p></blockquote>
Obviously the purpose of the clause is to prevent the opposite of double taxation—If I may put it that way, double allowance or double deduction—but there are provisions elsewhere in the Bill, particularly in the difficult Schedule 6. There may be provision in that Schedule for deducting twice, gathering it in at a second point on a double allowance and then granting a disallowance afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The words in the amendment are words of precaution which would do no harm to the Bill but which would give the taxpayer some protection against the complications of the schedules to this Bill which, when reading them, one thinks are right for a few lines but then one suddenly disappears into the mist and wonders what the hell it is talking about. So I seek to put in these words as a precaution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman explained that this was a drafting amendment in the sense that it was intended to make the Bill even clearer in relation to deductions. We believe that the words are not necessary. The point is fully covered by what is set out in Clause 4(6), and I do not see that at
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0749">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>333</span>
present it is necessary to include these words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if cases arise, especially in relation to Schedule 6, in which there is some doubt with regard to these deductions, we shall he happy to look at those cases as they arise. At present we cannot think of any situation where there will be difficulty arising from the way in which Clause 6 is drafted. But if cases arise during the course of the Committee proceedings we shall take note of them and put matters right, if that be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope with that assurance that the right hon. Gentleman will feel that he can withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am much obliged. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>
	<p>	<i>Question proposed, That the clause stand part of the Bill.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is one point on Clause 4 with which we have not dealt in the amendments. It arises on subsection (2), which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In this Act, in relation to a disposal of an interest in land, 'the chargeable person' means the person making the disposal."</p></blockquote>
As I understand our previous debates, particularly on Clause 2, there may be interests in land which are affected by, for example, a deemed disposal and they may be so affected without any consent, action or conduct on the part of the owner of the interest in the land. We have talked about easements, the benefit of restrictive covenants and those kinds of lesser interests in the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure whether—when there is a disposal by what I shall call the main owner of the land—one can say that the person who owns a lesser interest in the land, and who may well be charged up with development land tax by reason of the transaction, is a person who is making the disposal. I cannot quite see how that ties up with, for example, the interpretation clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 46(1) states that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"'chargeable person' has the meaning assigned to it by section 4(2) of this Act",</p></blockquote>
that is, the subsection which I have been reading. I shall come to "interest in land" at some later stage during our
	<span class='label label-info column'>334</span>
debate, because we do not have all the definitions in one clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I doubt whether a person whose interest, involuntarily so far as he is concerned, has been affected by disposal and who has become a chargeable person in respect of that lesser interest, can be called a person making the disposal or a disposal. I should have thought that we needed a wider definition in order to catch with the lesser interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. My reading also indicates that it would be difficult, but I have been handed a note saying that, despite what may appear on the face of it any person making a deemed disposal of an interest makes the disposal of his interest. So if there is a deemed disposal of an interest, he is treated presumably for the purposes of the legislation as making a disposal of his interest, although actually he is not making a disposal. But we have deemed him to be making a disposal and thereby he is deemed to have made a disposal of his interest. Therefore, he is a chargeable person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have, therefore, to extend the deeming provisions: as it is deemed that a disposal is being made, it has been made, and if it is made by a someone having a personal interest in land he is a chargeable person. I am told that that is the correct interpretation of the subsection.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to make heavy weather of this, but the word "making" or "made" appears to be unnecessarily restrictive and will cause difficulties. I want this cleared up merely from the point of view of interpretation, so that the taxpayer knows what his liability is and litigation is avoided as much as possible. It seems so easy to say that the chargeable person means the person whose interest is affected by the transaction in some way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not putting it in definitive words, but I should have thought that the word "making" almost insults the person who has been involuntarily deprived of more than half the profit from the transaction whereby his interest in the land has passed. Although the Minister received that firm note, I am sure that he will look at the matter again. I have great faith in him and if, from reading our comments, he feels it needs to be put right, I am sure he will do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0750">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>335</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Reading back over our deliberations, one might better understand what we have said than it is possible to understand this Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By comparison with other clauses, Clause 4 is relatively short. It even largely appears to be in English—or what one understands to be English—but, on closer inspection, we find that it is very curious English indeed. Subsection (1) talks about realised development value, and one does not have to sit on this Committee for very long to realise that, when the Government talk about realised development value, they do not mean that. They mean something which they have defined and decided to call realised development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There might be greater appreciation and understanding of our affairs if we avoided abusing the English language by calling something "realised" when quite clearly within no possible normal meaning of the word, it is "realised." I should not have thought it was beyond the undoubted ability of the parliamentary draftsman—after all, anyone who can draft this Bill must have an incredible amount of ability as well as determination—to find a form of words to cover what is really meant without using words outside the normal meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) drew our attention to a similar situation in subsection (2), where "the chargeable person" is brought in. As he said, the chargeable person may be someone who is not by arty conceivable normal meaning of the word making a disposal. He may not even be directly involved in the transaction. It may be outside his control. This, again, is an abuse of the normal meaning of a word which surely inevitably leads to misunderstandings about Parliament's real intention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If it is possible to minimise misunderstandings in this sort of legislation, then one should, for the complexities are such that however well we do our work there will be problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister also to look hard at the definitions in Clause 46 before we arrive at that stage. It appears to be a rather random list of definitions; a definition might be included there or included in some other part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>336</span>
For example, the definition of "chargeable person" is in Clause 4(2). Why not insert it in Clause 46(1), even if it is a duplication? Those with marginally less familiarity with the Bill than those of us who have spent some hours on it in Committee may not immediately know where to turn for a definition that is not in the definition clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it would be helpful if that matter could be considered before we reach Clause 46, so that as many as possible of the definitions that we meet at random places elsewhere in the Bill are brought together in one place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 4(3) says—
	<br><blockquote><p>"References in this Act to the net proceeds of the disposal…".</p></blockquote>
Once again, we wonder what the Government mean by those words, which should be fairly simple to understand. "The net proceeds" ought to mean the proceeds less the expenses of sale. If that is so, why are accountants' fees, for example, not allowed when there are complexities such as are in this legislation? That is a matter to which we might return later, because in subsection (4) we are referred to Schedule 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those of us with the strength left to turn to Schedule 2 will find that it comprises 17 pages. The balance between the reference at this point and the incredible complexity of Schedule 2 seems wrong. One would have hoped that more of the content of Schedule 2 could have been expressed in this main part of the Bill instead of being left so extensively in the Schedule.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend moved, and later withdrew, an amendment to subsection (5), but again it is a matter of being wordy. The taxpayer will inevitably be driven to the opinion that the system is stacked up against him. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"…the method of apportionment adopted shall be such as appears to the Board, or, on an appeal, to the Commissioners concerned to be just and reasonable."</p></blockquote>
So they are to be judge and jury in their own case! The Minister of State may say that is not what is intended, but, if that is so, why cannot the words be such as an ordinary person would understand, and "just and reasonable" should mean just reasonable and not an arbitrary decision by an administrative body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We come, finally, to subsection (6). It appears to make sense until one tries to think of the circumstances in which it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0751">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>337</span>
applies. I am again critical of the ochre book—the Development Land Tax Bill Explanatory Notes—because on this sub-section I find the Explanatory Notes remarkably unexplanatory. It says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Subsection (6) Guards against double deductions in arriving at the amount of any realised development value".</p></blockquote>
The mind boggles at the consequences to the Exchequer if one had double deductions. It sounds like one of the more complicated manoeuvres of gymnasts or bridge players. However, a double deduction might make more sense if we had some explanation or example as to what it refers to and what is being guarded against. We might then know whether this is a reasonable provision or something which we should consider removing from the Act altogether.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This clause almost sums up—in its brief length—many of the problems we face in considering this Bill—the imbalance between the length and complexity of the schedules and the clauses which introduce them; the untidiness of the definitions which are scattered arbitrarily among clauses throughout the Bill and in the definition clause; but, most of all, the total abuse of the English language by using terms like "realised" when one does not mean "realised".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot believe that it is beyond the wit of man to devise a better form of wording so that those of us who have the disadvantage—or, as some would say, advantage—of not being lawyers might more readily understand what we are trying to get at in the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make two points only. First, I suggest that instead of the word "realised" it would be more accurate to call it the estimated development value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I am in agreement with my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) about the importance of having a single and comprehensive definition clause. I agree with him that it is impossible to understand the terms of art if one is uncertain as to exactly where the definition will be. What is more, the difficulty arises here that, when one looks at a word, one can never be sure whether it is a term of art or not a term of art. One can never be sure whether it is necessary to have a look at the schedule or at the definition clause, whether one is expected
	<span class='label label-info column'>338</span>
to construe it according to one's understanding of the English language, or whether to look somewhere else. This is important because there are, for instance, phrases like "outline planning permission" which, as we know, have begun to have special meanings in other areas of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I would suggest that if we could have, perhaps, a final schedule in the form of almost a complete, exclusive and exhaustive definition section of everything, we would be very much helped.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I add briefly to the remarks of my hon. Friend? The problem of definition is very serious. For those who have not lived with the drafting of the Bill and its intention, it is the worst possible kind of Chinese puzzle to find a way round the Bill and to know, when one is cross-referred to another clause, whether a particular phrase has the same meaning in the new context as in the old one. One can spend an enormous amount of time, in a negative sense, in satisfying oneself as to whether there is a special meaning attached to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the bodies which has distributed comments on the Bill sent us a document which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"'the relevant interest' is defined 20 times and on each occasion the definition is different".</p></blockquote>
It must be possible to achieve greater consistency than that. It says also that
	<br><blockquote><p>"you may be unwilling to believe it and so we note the references".</p></blockquote>
I will not quote the references now, but they start with Section 6(1) and continue until Schedule 8(48)(1)(	<i>b</i>).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Such a drafting might just be tolerable if each definition were used in an isolated provision in the Bill—that is, each isolated from the other 19 definitions."</p></blockquote>
But it is not, and it is exceedingly difficult to understand at any point whether one is dealing with the right definition of the same technical term which occurs in a different context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a horrifying case, but further examples of multiple definition are also listed, some of which occur twice, some three times, some five times, some six times and another—"subsequent disposal"—occurs seven times in different connotations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties in comprehending the Bill is that, even when we have satisfied
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0752">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>339</span>
ourselves that we are dealing with the right technical definition, we then have to adjust our thinking in such a way as to remember everything else that we have been told and have debated about other provisions, where the same form of words is used but with a different technical meaning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not say more, except to reinforce the plea to the Minister as to whether anything could be done to tidy up the Bill, later—perhaps with an index of special definitions, particularly those which occur in so many different instances, or whether some other means of drawing the attention of those who will use the Bill to variations in meanings can be devised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nicholas Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only cure for this Bill, even at this early stage, is for the Government to scrap it and come forward with a Bill that has some meaning. It is clear from this simplest of clauses, which I again imagine is not understood by any member of the Committee, that if it is believed by any member of the Committee to be understood, his understanding will be different from the understanding of any other member of the Committee. I further imagine that any tax officer who must interpret these provisions will take a different view of their meaning from that of any other tax officer. As it appears, so far as the Bill shows us, that the tax officer will be 	<i>judex in sua re,</i> it would seem important that the judges should have a unanimous opinion on their own behalf and not a disparate opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot condemn too highly the practice of bad legislation. This House recently considered the Renton Report on the proper framing of legislation. The Bill contradicts on every page and every recommendation of that Report on how legislation should be drafted. It is the height of hypocrisy to say at one moment that we will identify what is wrong and at the next moment promote the disease intentionally. It is no good Ministers telling us that somebody will understand or interpret it; because it does not mean anything.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the terminology of terms of art, they should be defined in an interpretation clause. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) said, there are phrases which appear to mean different things 20 times. There are phrases, as has been pointed out, such as
	<span class='label label-info column'>340</span>
realised development value which mean unrealised development value. The Bill is essentially meaningless to any human being. It is certainly meaningless to lawyers. It can mean either nothing or anything. Lord Justice Scarman defined a section of the Finance Act 1970 as capable of three interpretations. It can mean what the plaintiff says it means; it can mean what the defendant says it means, or it can mean anything else that anybody else cares to say that it means. In other words, it means nothing. The same can be said of this Bill, in my opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It always interests me that the House criticises lawyers as wanting law to be abstruse so that they make more money out of it, which is in no way true. I should like to quote a comment made by the Law Society of Scotland, which is a professional society of lawyers, about this matter:
	<br><blockquote><p>…in the case of this Bill…"</p></blockquote>
the complexity and abstruseness
	<br><blockquote><p>"…has gone too far and that the Bill will be very difficult…"</p></blockquote>
…if not impossible—
	<br><blockquote><p>"…for the professional adviser and the Revenue to understand and accordingly to administer in the manner intended."</p></blockquote>
11 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I note the words "in the manner intended", because I do not think that the Ministers know what is the intention or manner. It is important that one can predict that the Bill was not framed by one hand, because no man—not even Gibbon—if he cared to spend his life drafting it, would have drafted this document. This is the work of many hands and many minds which did not come to the same conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment we are taking the nine other amendments which you have mentioned, Mr. Fitch.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 48 seeks not to leave words out, but merely to alter the date
	<span class='label label-info column'>342</span>
1965 to 1945. Amendment No. 40, which is an alternative to Amendment No. 39 or 48, deals with the same subject but is an alternative way of dealing with it. Amendment Nos. 87 to 93 are merely consequential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an amendment to the clause which sets out the relevant base value from which one starts one's calculations of the sum upon which development land tax is payable. We are familiar with these three base values as set out in Clause 5(1), but we are familiar with them the other way up. I cannot see why the draftsmen in drafting the Bill decided to turn them on their heads when we have known them the other way around in development gains tax. We now have to learn A, B, and C as C, B, and A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the relevant base value A to which this amendment applies. It appears in subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>) and it is a figure which one arrives at by adding four items together. It will be five items if the Committee accept the Paymaster-General's amendment, which I am sure will be welcomed. Therefore, there are five factors to be added to the aggregate which we are asked to consider in arriving at base A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Briefly, they are, first, the purchase money; secondly, the cost of relevant improvements; thirdly, the excess of current use value at disposal time over the current use value at acquisition time—or, in the alternative, the current use value on 6th April 1965; fourthly, the special addition; and, fifthly, the special addition on—I was about to say "religious instruction" again, that is, R.I.—relevant improvements. It is to the third of those that the amendment wishes to make an alteration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having found the current use value at the time that one disposed of the relevant interest and at the time of its acquisition—that is, going back to the acquisition—then if it was acquired before 5th April 1965 one scraps that discovery and takes the value as on 6th April 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with disposal and acquisition, as I understand it, this is not the order we are asked to consider the facts in the case of deemed disposal. For a "deemed disposal", we are deemed to dispose of the interest and immediately to reacquire it. But here we are talking of the later disposal after an acquisition of property, and the date of acquisition, if it falls before 6th April 1965, is disregarded and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0754">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>343</span>
the current use value as at 6th April 1965 is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suspect that this is purely and simply for the convenience of the Revenue. I believe that the Revenue has no records prior to 1965 on which it could check the current use value of property prior to that date. But it may work very unfairly on the taxpayer. The absence of a complete record is no reason why one should not endeavour to assess the value of the property as at the time it was acquired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be the evidence of the purchase money at that time and, no doubt, evidence of the property's condition at that time. It should not be beyond the valuer's art to say what the current use value of the property was back 	<i>ad innitum.</i> I have suggested in the second amendment that that date might be limited to 1945—that would be the second preference. The better way might be to delete these words altogether and leave it to a reasonable valuation of the current use value at the time the relevant interest in the land was acquired.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the first two alternatives: either we leave it at large for a valuation to be made whatever the date of the acquisition or, as a compromise, we take it back to 1945 instead of being limited to 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third alternative is in the rather longer Amendment No. 40, which leaves a choice, as it were, between two amounts. I refer to Amendment No. 40 in detail. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where the interest of the chargeable person was acquired prior to 6th April 1965"—</p></blockquote>
incidentally, this amendment would, of course, leave paragraph (	<i>a</i>) as drafted but would impose a limitation, as it were—
	<br><blockquote><p>"subsection (1) above shall apply as if each of the references to cost were a reference to the higher of the two sums".</p></blockquote>
This, of course, would give the taxpayer a very reasonable choice to produce the figure which will be of benefit to him. I say that quite frankly, because I think that the clause as it stands is a great disadvantage to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those two sums are:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the cost of the chargeable person's acquisition of the interest and the market value of that interest at 6th April 1965".</p></blockquote>
Those should not be difficult figures to ascertain, certainly not
	<br><blockquote><p>"the cost of the chargeable person's acquisition of the interest."</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>344</span>
If one does not then know the date of acquisition in order to assess the market value, one takes against that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the market value of that interest at 6th April 1965 and as if the reference to the time of acquisition stated in subsection (1)(	<i>a</i>)(iii) above were a reference to 6th April 1965",</p></blockquote>
it would relieve the taxpayer of the hardship which might occur in many cases if the Bill were left as it is now drafted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have become accustomed in development gains tax to working from these bases, but we are presented with a lot of complications as they are now drafted, and I hope that Amendment No. 40, will not create more complications. But I do not think it will do that, as it is quite clear what figures would have to be discovered then and how the calculations would be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come back to the point I made to start with. I do not think there is any good reason, from the point of the principle of the tax, why this date should be in. The only reason is that it makes a convenient date which the Revenue can use as against the taxpayer. It is our duty to see that the taxpayer is not penalised merely for the convenience of the Revenue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Spicer</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the opportunity to support this group of amendments, if only because it enables me to allay the anxieties and fears of my right hon. and hon Friends who are becoming quite concerned that I have not yet uttered a word in the committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been living in my own private stupefaction at the complexity, obscurity and the verbosity of the whole business. The one exercise I have been trying to perform, particularly in relation to Clause 5, is to see just who is going to gain from this Bill. I have come to the conclusion that it is a nobody's gains Bill, unless one takes the view that, as a result of the high taxation which, if we accept Clause 5 unamended by the suggestions we are putting forward, the rate of the tax levy may be very high, and the only gainer then might be the taxpayer if the Government should decide to reduce, for instance, personal taxes in compensation. I do not have any great faith that, despite what may happen this afternoon, this administration are likely to embark upon a major programme of reduced taxation as a result of the Bill when enacted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0755">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>345</span>
The only people who will make a bomb out of this, particularly if we cannot find some way of simplifying the Bill—some of the amendments which I will come to later are designed to simplify it—are the chartered surveyors and chartered accountants. If we are now to go back to historic valuations, I would add chartered historians. The Bill is a charter for chartered accountants and chartered surveyors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All this is by way of necessary backdrop to what I want to say in support of the amendments. It relates to the context in which I believe the clause must be viewed in terms of the rapid rise of inflation, particularly in the past few years, but also over most of the period to which some of the amendments relate. The RPI index has gone up 227 per cent. in the last 20 years, and we are still suffering 16½ per cent. inflation—twice as high as that in any other country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So we have to view the clause in the context of very high rates of inflation. If amendments which have been tabled by the Opposition are not accepted, I believe that the Bill, if enacted, will discriminate heavily against the owners and developers of land, particularly in cases where the land was acquired some time ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clause 5 makes no genuine allowance for the rate of inflation in the assessment of the base values on which the tax is to be levied. It is possible to argue that subsection (4), concerning the special addition which we shall be discussing under Clause 6, might be claimed to be some kind of catch element which will at least enable any future Government to allow for something as obscure as inflation. The Government have never been completely candid about the purpose of the special addition, but I assume, and I suspect they do likewise, that its purpose is to make allowance for the interest rate factor, rather than the inflation factor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That being so, the only allowance made in Clause 5 for the rate of inflation as it affects the tax under consideration is paragraph (	<i>a</i>) (iii), where some modest allowance is made in the context of the difference between the current user value at the time of acquisition, so long as it is after 1965, and the current user value at the time of the disposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>346</span>
That is just not good enough. Major price rises occurred well before 1965. I said earlier that the retail price index has risen by 227 per cent. in 20 years. Even if one accepts that Clause 5(1)(	<i>a</i>)(iii) provides some recognition of the inflationary factor, that will be of very little comfort to anyone who bought land before 1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This group of amendments all relate to that point. Some of the amendments suggest that we should go back at least to 1945, and Amendment No. 40 suggests that we should consider the market value at the time of acquisition. My preference would have been to provide some kind of indexed relationship to the cost of acquisition as stated in paragraph (	<i>a</i>)(i) in base A, and—or to index the cost of improvements which would apply to both base B and base C. If that is impracticable—I accept that it may well be—we must at least relate the values upon which we base this tax to something more realistic in terms of the inflation that has taken place since those valuations were made. Otherwise, for people who had and bought land before 1965 we could be considering extremely high rates of tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contend—I am sure that my hon. Friends will agree with me—that, if that is the case, this clause could provide a serious deterrent both to the supply of land and to its development.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will speak to Amendment No. 48, which is grouped with Amendment No. 39, but before I do so I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) on his initial comments to the Committee. He paid us the compliment of speaking to the amendments, which is not always done in Committee, and this is greatly to be supported. We hope to hear from him again soon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 48 is to be particularly commended. As my right hon. Friend said, as the Bill stands the calculation of realised development value using base A would take no account of an increase in current use value prior to 6th April 1965. Therefore, for property held before that date, such a calculation would be less favourable than one using base B. This obviously would penalise those who hold old property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that capital gains after 1965 can be taken into account in computations under the time apportionment
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0756">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>347</span>
method, where favourable, under Schedule 6(24)(6) of the Finance Act 1965. If that is so, there does not appear to be any logical reason not to take account of development gains since that date in development land tax computations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend said, the date 6th April 1965 is fast becoming one of those dates like 1065, beyond which the memory of man runneth not. Another date might be 1st July 1948 which marked the introduction of the 100 per cent. charge under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. I am glad to see that my hon. Friend nods. Calculations were made back to that date for many years. Yet again, in this Bill our old friend the unexpended balance of development value is referred to, although that section of the Act has been repealed since 1954.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe, as my right hon. Friend said, that it is possible for valuers to establish realistically a figure before 6th April 1965. There may be specific records available, whether they be in mortgage calculations or whatever, or there may be records available in publications such as the 	<i>Estates Gazette</i> if it is concerned with the sale of land, and so on. But we must never underestimate the enormous ability of the valuer to make any calculation which he sets his mind to. In this regard, I am indebted to the calculations made by Mr. T. A. Johnson, B.Sc., F.R.I.C.S., and Mr. E. F. Westlake, B.Sc., A.R.I.C.S., both therefore by definition chartered surveyors, in a series of articles in the 	<i>Estates Gazette</i> last November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promise HANSARD that I will submit this in evidence, otherwise it will be completely unintelligible, but I should like to give the Committee the flavour of these calculations which have been made for the purposes of assessing development fand tax.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In this particular example it is on a freehold warehouse with a floor area of 20,000 ft. super, purchased in 1966 for £50,000. In 1968 improvements were made costing £25,000. The present rental value of the warehouse is £1.50 per foot super. Without improvements it would be £1 per foot super. More description follows—for example, calculation of realisation value, Proceeds of disposal: full rental value of offices, 20,000 sq. ft. at £5 per sq. ft., £100,000 per annum; rent payable, 60 per cent. of FRV, £60,000 per annum; year's purchase, 40 years at 8 per cent., 11·92, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>348</span>
There are two pages of mathematical calculations for the purposes of calculating development land tax on this warehouse. If the valuers can make such complex calculations, particularly when they are talking about, say, years of purchase in perpetuity deferred for 37 years at 10 per cent., and so on, I refuse to believe that they are not in a position to be able to estimate, for example, what the value of property was in 1961. There is evidence available: it is published at the time. I should have thought it perfectly possible to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After all, in 1967—my right hon. Friend will remember this well—Parliament set valuers the job of trying to estimate the value of the lease 50 years after its expiry for the purposes of the Leasehold Reform Act 1967. So far as I know, although the Act was badly drafted and had to be amended, there was no great difficulty in the valuers making the calculation. They had their Parry's tables and they were able to do these calculations. Similarly, if it is possible for them to work forward, I believe that it is possible for them to work back.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Financial Secretary when he replies to the debate will doubtless say that people can use base B, and so on. But what we are trying to establish in the Bill is that there is no necessary magic in the date 6th April 1965. We believe that it is possible for the calculation contained in Amendment No. 48 to be made. I do not think there is any reason why we should continue to adhere to the date on which capital gains tax was introduced. A lot has happened since then. The longer the period that expires between the passing of an Act and 6th April 1965 the more irrelevant that date will be, and the more important it will be to have a realistic assessment of the date of the transaction for the purposes of chargeable gain than some abstract date in the past.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Robert Sheldon)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a large number of amendments, and I see that the Opposition have been very busy. I always understand the problems when one decides not to go further in dealing with all the consequential amendments. In fact, there would be a number more required. But the point is well taken, and I myself have been in the position so often of wondering whether one should go right through the

	<span class='label label-info column'>349</span>
Bill looking at all the consequentials, or must look at some of them to show that one has grasped the essential points. I take that to be the reason for Amendments Nos. 87 to 93. I think the right hon. Gentleman confirms that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the right hon. Gentleman said, we are dealing with three bases here. I take his point about the complexity of changing the order of bases. I remember one lecturer from whom I suffered considerably who always used to give his equations in the form A=B/C; C=B/A and B=AC. Therefore, we always had three formulae for the price of one. The difficulty was that one could never be sure which one was which examination time. I see the problem to which the right hon. Gentleman referred as one of a similar kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He pointed out that in this Bill base A is the aggregate of the cost of purchase, the expenditure on improvements, and the increase in current use value subject to the complications to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, and the special addition as well as the further special addition on relevant improvements. There is the problem of choosing the date to which he referred. I think the Committee will accept that one of the practical advantages—I do not know whether pre-1965 was the dark ages—is that it gives us a very large measure of valuation, which was relevant at the same date for other purposes, so we are able to make comparisons and checks of a kind that the administration find convenient. This is therefore convenient for the administration and valuers generally, when they advise their clients. I turn to Admendment No. 48 which alters the date 1965 to 1945 and this will interest the hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham). He complained that the Bill takes no account of the increase in current use value pre-1965. He mentioned the question of people using base B and we all take that point. But development land tax is not capital gains tax, and although he referred to the apportionments possible under capital gains tax, the whole purpose of the development land tax—and it may be that in this particular we are not at one—is to tax the values arising from development, whether the increase was post-1965 or pre-1965.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This may be one of those matters which the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends will wish to see changed at some
	<span class='label label-info column'>350</span>
future remote date that we cannot foresee, if they ever achieve that responsibility. There is a difference of view on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the introduction of the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Mr. Spicer) to these debates, who railed against the obscurity of parts of the Bill. He is following a worthy tradition from his constituency. I remember hearing and occasionally receiving the lash of his predecessor on these points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked who will gain. This is one of those simple questions which need to be asked more generally in our debates. It is a good principle to ask that question. The people who gain are, as we have said many times, the community in general. That still remains the basis of our legislation. The hon. Gentleman asked us to look at these amendments in the context of the high rate of inflation. I grant that this is a problem which has not been capable of solution by any Government. I note his request for some form of indexation, but perhaps the next clause might more suitably fit into that request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will recall the arguments against indexation adduced from both sides in debates on the Finance Bill. Without revealing anything that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer might say this afternoon, the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised that the arguments against indexation remain very strong. He rightly pointed out that the special addition is related to interest provisions, but again that is a matter which will arise on the next clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has already been made to the problem of records prior to 1965. There is the further difficulty of trying to assess what there might be in the way of hardship to those who have had increases in current use values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am afraid that, despite the Inland Revenue's attention to these points and its willingness to consider examples of possible hardship, none have been forthcoming. Perhaps I may now repeat the offer and promise further consideration of any real examples of hardship.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman knows, I am particularly anxious to find out how all our legislation impinges on those who have to meet its various requirements; and this is one such further action. If the hon. Gentleman can find such evidence, I shall be more than delighted to listen to it. Meanwhile, from my standpoint, I do not

One question emerges from the Financial Secretary's remarks, when he said that the question of inflation was best raised on the next clause.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sheldon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Financial Secretary has certainly confirmed what I thought to be the position—namely, that the date 1965 was inserted in the clause as a matter of convenience.

One could, of course, boil down the Bill to any number of aspects where one could make it a lot easier for valuers, but it would not always be to the benefit of the taxpayer, and making it a convenience to the valuers in general ought not to weigh us with in deciding what is fair and just to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I did not entirely follow the Financial Secretary's justification for the fact that the clause did not take into account pre-1965 inflation.

	<span class='label label-info column'>352</span>
	<p>that the values arising merely from increase in current use value are not values arising from development. That factor was clearly recognised in the previous legislation, both on the capital gains tax and on development gains tax, but here we are, if we accept the figure of 1965, taxing an increase in current use value pre-1965 on the fictitious assumption that it is an increase arising from development.</p>
	<p>The Financial Secretary then challenged the Opposition to produce cases in which this has created hardship in the past and is likely to do so in future. One receives an enormous amount of briefs from people outside deeply interested in the Bill, but one does not come to the Committee armed with individual cases, or with requests, under the present legislation, to consider the relief which can be given to such cases.</p>
	<p>I base the argument on the matter of principle that, if the Bill remains as it is, we shall be taxing an increase in current use value as if it were an increase in development value; that is, the current use value, pre-1965. 1 think it is a wholly wrong principle.

The second amendment was something of a compromise. On that basis, 1 suppose one could say that one accepted a taxation of increase in current use value as an increase in development value if it occurred before 1945.</p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 13, in page 	<b>5,</b> line 	<b>25,</b> at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>'and—
	<br><blockquote><p>(v) where subsection (4A) below applies, the amount of the further addition referred to in that subsection.'</p></blockquote></p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We shall also take Government Amendments Nos. 14 to 16.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These amendments are being moved in consequence of representations made to us by various interests. They relate to the provision of special addition to relevant improvements allowed as a deduction within base A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 13 and 15 specifically provide that special addition shall be allowed in relation to the relevant improvements if they are applied to the costs of acquisition within base A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16 sets out the formula by which the special addition is to be computed. It is a reasonably simple formula. All it says, in effect, is that if the special addition applied to costs of acquisition increased those costs of acquisition by, say, 25 per cent., the relevant improvements that can be deducted are also increased by 25 per cent. The formula follows in fact the calculation for special addition in relation to costs of acquisition. Amendment No. 14 is merely consequential upon Amendment No. 16.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will note that some of these amendments in fact relate to Schedule 3, which can almost be read with Clause 5. This is a concession as a result of representations made to us. It was felt that it might be unfair in certain circumstances to deny special addition to those cases where relevant improvements might constitute a large element in cost and where the financing of relevant improvements might be as onerous and burdensome as financing the costs of acquisition in view of high rates of interest. It has therefore been decided to apply special addition to relevant improvements. All the other rules about special addition—the tapering, the coming to an end in 1977—will apply, but I think that hon. Gentlemen will appreciate that this is a worth while concession, especially to industrial developers who might have very large bills to meet for relevant improvements and who would benefit from this concession.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>354</span>
For that reason, because this is a help to taxpayers and because of the representations made to us, I hope that the Committee will accept the amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his explanation of the amendments tabled by the Government to meet the representations made to them. We believe that they will be a useful addition in calculating the liability to tax of companies and others who, in the last few years, as the Minister said, may have incurred considerable expenditure, not perhaps on the site itself but on relevant improvements to it. At this time of high interest rates and rapid inflation it seems sensible and reasonable that the special addition should also apply to that. We therefore welcome the amendments as improvements to the Bill in equity, and we think that they will assist commercially those who have made the representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) in welcoming the amendments except for one small point—I am sorry the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) is not here—for I see in the formula in Amendment No. 16 that, commendably, the Paymaster-General has given us the letters "RI" to indicate relevant improvements. But having gone that far, he has completely failed to indicate what the letters A and C mean. I am glad the hon. Member for Farnworth has arrived. I will not do any tedious repetition as I think he will pick up what I was saying. The letter A used in the formula is the amount so included by virtue of subparagraph (	<i>iv</i>) of paragraph (	<i>a</i>) of subsection (1), which was the special addition, so why not call it SA, instead of just A? C is the amount so included by virtue of sub-paragraph (	<i>i</i>) of that paragraph. That was the cost of acquisition, so why not call it PM—the purchase money—or CA, the cost of acquisition?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier I complimented the Treasury Ministers and the draftsmen of the Bill on having used letters which indicated what they were. I am not so sure that that is the case in this clause. The expressions base A, base B and base C do not tell us what it is about. We have learnt what it is over a period of years. I am looking a gift horse in the mouth, though. I am obliged for the concession, but it should

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is this new concession in the amendment, which I welcome, subject to the time limits in it which are contained in the special concessions under Clause 6, or will it always be there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The time limit applies as for special addition. This concession merely follows. It is a special addition applied to relevant improvements as it is now applied under the Bill to cost of acquisition under base A.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John Roper</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for not being present at the beginning of the Minister's remarks on Amendment No. 16, but I support what he has said. In many places in the Bill the Government have admirably found appropriate letters. But there are other places, and this is the first example with this amendment, to which we shall return later where they have not done so and have arbitrarily allocated letters to particular matters. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will agree to look at this matter again, because the good example which the Government have set in some parts of the Bill should be continued throughout.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>Amendment agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 71, in page 5, line 26, leave out '110' and insert '120'.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this amendment, it will also be convenient to take the following amendments:</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Amendments Nos. 72 and 77 are purely consequential, and if under "Sheldon's law" I have omitted to mention some other possible consequential amendment I hope that I will receive the usual dispensation afforded to Opposition Members moving amendments to complicated legislation when they have not picked up all consequences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>356</span>
Amendments Nos. 71 and 59 are substantive amendments. It will be noted that we tabled Amendment No. 59 earlier than Amendment No. 71, and it is to this amendment that we attach the great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 59 would introduce a figure of 120 per cent.
	<br><blockquote><p>"of the aggregate of the cost of the chargeable person's acquisition of the interest and of any expenditure on improvements"</p></blockquote>
as base C and, in doing so, would bring the arrangements into line with the provisions of development gains tax enacted by the present Goverment in the Finance Act 1974, Section)38(3)(	<i>a</i>) of which reads:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The net proceeds of the disposal reduced by an amount equal to 120 per cent. of the total sum that is by virtue of paragraph 4 (1)(	<i>a</i>) and (	<i>b</i>) of Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 1965 allowable as a deduction from the consideration for the disposal in computing the chargeable gain."</p></blockquote>
Amendment No. 71 relates to current use value—that is, base B—in the development land tax, which is equivalent to base B in the development gains tax legislation. Here, I must accept that this would not bring the development land tax into line with development gains tax, since 120 per cent. does not apply in the current use value formula under development gains tax. Nevertheless, if we are introducing a new figure for consistency between the two different bases, Amendment No. 71 is consequential upon Amendment No. 59 although a case can be made out for that amendment in its own right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In computing the tax liability in many cases, if base A is not to be used, it is right that there should be a reasonable margin of error, not only because of the imprecise nature of some of the valuations which are likely to arise n the working of this tax, but also because there are a number of peripheral costs which are not specifically allowable under the Bill and which could be swept up in a slightly more generous provision. This would not only be more equitable in many cases, but would also help to exclude a number of the smaller and more marginal cases. We therefore believe that a figure of 120 per cent. which the present Government sanctioned in their enactment of the Finance Act 1974 for similar gains under development gains tax legislation would be appropriate in these two cases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I interject a plea at this point for the Government to consider the point made earlier about having bases A, B and C in the gains tax provisions back to front in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0761">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>357</span>
the legislation. Instead of reversing the order in the present Bill, we might have separate letters altogether, such as X, Y and Z. This is a serious suggestion, because there are cases where the two taxes will interact and, in the interests of simplicity and comprehensibility, it is easier when one refers to a specific base if one knows which legislation determines it. Although I think that we have the worst of all possible words at present because we have the same letters which mean different things, it would be better if they meant comparable things. It would be better still to have a different set of letters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) would prefer, we could have the letters D, E and F. With the natural progression of taxation we will perhaps reach the end of the alphabet one day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that that digression is not irrelevant, but it is difficult to consider the provisions of the development land tax in relation to the development gains tax, and this only adds to the difficulty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister of State to make some practical comment on the working of this clause in relation to these bases. From a number of calculations which have been made, illustrative of the way in which these might work, it seems that normally where available, base A is more favourable than bases B and C for this purpose. I see that the Minister of State agrees, so perhaps we have done our arithmetic correctly. That is gratifying to know. There is a time limit on base A because of the special addition. When we come to discuss the special addition, no doubt that will be the proper place for a debate on how long it should last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I merely observe at this point that in the near term, and particularly with the higher rate of special addition of 15 per cent. instead of 10 per cent. operating in the earliest years, there will be a considerable advantage in many cases, in using base A.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[Mr. R. Bonner Pink 	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now talking about bases B and C, and it seems sensible that if base A is acceptable to the Government now as a starting point for this tax, bases B and C should not be as far out of line as they are
	<span class='label label-info column'>358</span>
under the present arrangement. We feel, therefore, that a modest step in this direction could be made by substituting 120 per cent. for 110 per cent. in the calculations. We feel also that this would assist, in practical terms, many of those who have to operate the tax. It may take a number of smaller and marginal cases out of tax altogether, and I hope that some of my hon. Friends may be able to give examples of the way in which this works in practice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We believe that these amendments would, by achieving simplification and securing this very modest easing of the impact of the tax, assist in its operation in the way in which the Government hope that it will work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, in moving the amendment, said that as he saw bases B and C, and as he saw his amendment, this was intended to create a reasonable margin of error or tolerance, and that is how we should regard the 110 per cent. It is not intended to be a further relief from taxation, although it may provide such a relief. There are other exemptions and reliefs in the Bill to provide for that—for example, the £10,000 exemption on the first slice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 110 per cent. figure has been chosen precisely, as the hon. Gentleman implied, because valuation is an art and it is necessary to provide a tolerance over 100 per cent. to take into account of the various problems that arise in relation to valuation and to take out the very small cases which otherwise might be brought into the scope of the legislation. To that extent, this makes the administration slightly easier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make it clear that this is not intended to be seen as a further relief from taxation. Once we reach 120 per cent., we are saying that one-fifth of the increase, in the case of base B, is to be free of tax, in effect, in addition to the other exemptions in the Bill. Hon. Gentlemen may say that our £10,000 exemption should have gone up to £20,000 and that there should be other exemptions, as the rate is too high. Our purpose here is not basically to give exemptions, but to take into account the margins and difficulties that can take place in valuation and provide a tolerance over and above the basic current use value in base B and the cost of acquisition in base C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We think that 10 per cent. is the right figure; if one goes to 20 per cent., that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0762">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>359</span>
getting to one-fifth, which we believe to be too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that we should follow what applies with the development gains tax. Very often in this Committee one hears criticisms, especially of drafting, such as "Why do you follow this or that language". But here we are told we should follow the development gains charge. It may be that it was not the right figure for the developments gain charge. I make no comment upon that, but we have come to the conclusion that the right figure is 110 per cent. in case case. We think that is fair, given the object of giving a tolerance of this kind, and I could neither accept this amendment nor recommend its acceptance to the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that base A was likely to be the most generous base. That is probably so, but not because of the special addition. Base A is likely to be the more beneficial base, because it is designed and drafted to meet most situations which are likely to arise. It is not because of a special addition necessarily that base A will be more generous, as the special addition, when it tapers off, has nothing to do with it. Base A would still cover the majority of cases because it allows an increase in current use value, and various other factors are incorporated into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bases B and C are simpler and can apply where base A is not so easily obtainable to the taxpayer. Base B merely deals with increase in current use value and base C is the cost of acquisition, plus 10 per cent. These will be the administratively simple ones to work out and operate but, in most cases, base A will be the one in relation to most developments to be applied by a developer. That, of course, is why base A is set out fully here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So bases B and C are not the major ones in relation to this tax. We think that 110 per cent. is a fair figure to take account of valuation fluctuations and other tolerances. As I have already said, I could not recommend the Committee to grant 120 per cent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. Pink for allowing me to intervene after the Minister of State, because I agree with many of the things that he has said. It is plain that base A is the most favourable of the three bases, and that those who are best advised, through the maze of this legislation, will, on the whole, wish to use base A. This will mean that those taxpayers, unhappily, who are best advised,
	<span class='label label-info column'>360</span>
and those who are richest, will undoubtedly get the best deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In equity, therefore, I would argue initially that it is right that we should give the well-advised taxpayer an equal chance with the ill-advised taxpayer by trying to give, as far as possible, equality of treatment under the three bases.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would suggest that an easement of some sort to base B and base C is right in terms of equity between taxpayers, but it must also be right in terms of administration costs, because it was made plain as we pressed the Minister that the Government are rightly apprehensive about the administrative costs of this legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During our debate we have had somewhat evasive answers about the administrative costs, though, if the answers were not evasive, at least we can say that we have been able to discover things only by direct questioning rather than by looking at volunteered information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is plain that there is room for a great deal of haggling, most of all about base A, and to a lesser extent about base B. With base C, there is not much room for haggling. I would suggest, therefore, that it is in the interests of the taxpayer, once the interests of the administration and the taxpayer coincide, that as many people as possible are assessed under base C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is because the cost of the acquisition of the interest is a matter about which there can be very little discussion, and there cannot be a great deal of discussion about the cost of any improvements. Therefore, it is comparatively easy to make that assessment. It is also something which is more important when we have inflation running at about 15 per cent. or 16 per cent., which can be done fairly quickly, and therefore the Revenue could be in a position to make an immediate demand for payment upon the taxpayer instead of allowing him to hold the money for a long time, as usually happens with these complicated pieces of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So I suggest that it is in the interests of everybody that there should be some easement at least of base C, in order that the relative advantages of base A and base B in relation to base C are reduced, so that more and more assessments are made on base C. As a result there will be fairness to individual taxpayers who will not be disadvantaged if they fail to get the most expensive professional advice. There will also, I submit, be substantial advantages,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0763">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>361</span>
in that the simplified method of assessment will reduce the number of people who have to be employed by the Revenue to make these complicated calculations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments relate to extremely important items in the Bill. If one is to have a tax on the difference between two figures, the matter is a little more complicated than a tax which is levied on just one figure: for example, somebody's income. The complication is that there is a great deal of significance when, as is proposed under this and associated legislation, with which some of us are unhappily only too familiar, there will be the possibility of local authorities acquiring land net of that tax. If they are to make acquisitions, there seems to be some advantage in it being relatively simple to determine what the tax is. I wish I could accept that we have anything by way of simplicity here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister of State has devoted many of his hours of study of the Bill to the excellent articles in the 	<i>Estates Gazette.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that of the three bases C is by far the simplest?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that it is the simplest. But perhaps I could come to some of its other drawbacks later. I was referring to the important series of articles in the 	<i>Estates Gazette</i> which started on 22nd November 1975 and continued in subsequent weeks. I am sure the Minister of State is very familiar with them. The introduction was not without significance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My one reaction to those articles is that I see that surveyors as well as lawyers find it extremely difficult sometimes to explain these complicated matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, that is not the only reaction one can logically have from these articles. The articles started by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"This model contains many phrases familar to those familar with the Land Commission Act 1967 and the Finance Act 1974…But beware: though the phrases may be broadly similar, the meaning is not necessarily that previously understood: The application of the Bill's proposals to a practical example show how straightforward or otherwise the calculations are…</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>362</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>Reactions to the example opposite may be that the calculation is lengthy; that there is vast scope for valuation argument…but that otherwise there is nothing too much to worry about. But what if the disposal is not a sale, but the grant of a lease?"</p></blockquote>
This is something which I think we ought to take into account. We often discuss these matters as if we were concerned solely with the disposal. It is another of the numerous elephant traps with which the Bill is littered, that we so abuse words that when we say "disposal" one is led to believe that they might actually mean disposal or supposed deemed disposal, and that deemed disposal might be assumed to be a sale of a lease. Of course that is not so. However, we are likely to be considering leases in one form or another.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article goes on:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and what happens if the sale is not of a freehold interest in possession, but a freehold reversion, or a leasehold interest?"</p></blockquote>
I put it to the Minister of State that anybody remotely familiar with the world of property—if he was not familiar with it before, I am sure he is rapidly becoming familiar with it—would be aware that one is much more likely to be dealing with that sort of interest and disposal than the sale of an unincumbered freehold. The article continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The White Paper has covered these eventualities with a few extra rules. Examining these, the most complex situations quickly develop…as central valuers we are unable to see the legal woods for the statutory trees."</p></blockquote>
I am delighted to find myself in such good company as the valuers in an alliance equally groping for a clear understanding of the consequences of this complex legislation. Surely the most important matter here is which base is likely to be used and which base is simplest and fairest to the taxpayer and tax gatherer. Also, I think we need to take into consideration the local authorities, because they will have a major role in these transactions if, when they acquire, they acquire net of tax. If I were the chief executive of some local authorities trying to advise the relevant committee on what I was likely to have to pay for some land, I think I would suggest that we did not buy it, because as like as not it would be proved that the advice that I would give the committee would be proved by subsequent events to be ill-founded in which case the wretched officer, who was only trying his best, would have left himself open to serious criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0764">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>363</span>
We go on to the sniping which occasionally happens in local authorities on political grounds and which would discredit the provisions of this Bill and the Community Land Act, which I am sure the Minister of State did not wish in any way to discredit. The Minister sets out by telling us that base A is likely to be the one most normally used. I think that is arguable. Of the four examples listed in the 	<i>Estates Gazette</i> articles, on two occasions base B turned out to be the most favourable answer to the taxpayer. The examples were taken during a period when the special addition would apply. If we exclude the special addition, we would find more cases where base B, or indeed base C, would be most likely to be used by the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) said it is simpler if we could assume that when the temporary and limited special addition expires base B and base C are likely to be used more often. One must look at these two separately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not in any way blame you, Mr. Bonner Pink, for the fact that we are considering Amendments Nos. 71 and 59 together, but this is a slightly unfortunate grouping because there is a perfectly valid argument for Amendment No. 59 that is separate from the argument for Amendment No. 71. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) said, Amendment No. 59 was tabled first. It is Amendment No. 59 which receives clear support from the principal institutions such as the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The Minister of State has rightly emphasised that he has tried to consult. What we on the Opposition benches fear is that he is too often only consulted and then the advice is not taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Institution, to whose words we must always listen to with care in this matter, has no doubt about the validity of Amendment No. 59. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We wish to repeat, with reference to Clause 5(1)(	<i>c</i>), the suggestion which we made in our interim memorandum…"—</p></blockquote>
so the Minister has had this on board for a long time—"
	<br><blockquote><p>"that the base figure for base (	<i>c</i>) should be 120 per cent., as it is for DGT. We see no reason for this difference…"</p></blockquote>
The Minister of State, in his initial remarks, did not advance any reason for the difference in respect of base C. The
	<span class='label label-info column'>364</span>
reasons he put forward largely attach to base B.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to complicate matters even further by going through all the calculations which are so difficult to explain in words. This is one of the occasions when a blackboard and chalk would be useful. But if we assume for the purposes of the argument that there will be occasions when base A is not the best value from the taxpayers' point of view and he prefers to look at base B or base C, the latter is
	<br><blockquote><p>"110 per cent. of the aggregate of the cost of the chargeable person's acquisition of the interest and of any expenditure on improvements."</p></blockquote>
If one looks at any normal commercial or industrial situation with base C in mind, in these unhappily inflationary days it is extremely unlikely that base C would be reasonable unless the acquisition had been fairly recent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the acquisition had been, say, five years ago for £100,000 and we have had an intervening aggregate rate of inflation of about 50 per cent.—which would be a great deal better in aggregate over that period than the Government's present target—unless that property has changed in value in a different way from the general level of inflation, it will be no consolation to the vendor, who in many cases will not be a willing seller—he will be being deprived of his interest by compulsory purchase by the exercise of the planning authority's powers under the Community Land Act—to be told that his cost of £100,000 plus 10 per cent., is £110,000, when inflation has already made his base rise to £150,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole question of base C is very unsatisfactory. The right answer would be to allow holding or inflation costs to be taken into account in base C.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It might be unfortunate that we have reached this point at this moment, because if we had waited another four or five hours perhaps the Chancellor would have had something to say about capital gains tax and how one should take into account the effects of inflation and time upon base values for capital gains tax. If he does, may I ask the Minister of State to return to this item, because anything that is applied to capital gains tax in this context should apply equally to base C?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would therefore say of base C that 120 per cent. is a minimum as a reasonable figure. It is supported by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. It is a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0765">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>365</span>
figure based on the development gains tax precedent, and even then it only to a limited extent takes account of the ravages of inflation on base values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument for Amendment No. 71 relating to case B is different. It was put very fairly by my hon. Friend the Member for Hitchen (Mr. Stewart). We are here concerned with the difficulty of determining accurately what a current use value is. One of the disadvantages of case A, and the reason many people will have to turn to case B, particularly after the special addition has expired, is the difficulty of determining current use value retrospectively.

Again, the tax experts assume that at any given moment everyone knows the current use value of something at any date. It is now well known that that is an extremely difficult thing to determine. It is a question of art rather than of science to have a valuation of property at any time if a transaction is not taking place. If one tries to value property a long time ago, it becomes much more arguable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In case A, which requires a current use value at an earlier date, it would be diffiuclt, and we are therefore likely to be looking at case B where we have a current use value at the time of disposal. This is not an exact figure. I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with the number of occasions when widely differing figures may be brought in by a number of experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ten per cent. is a very small margin. There are many cases which go as far as the Lands Tribunal with much wider differences of opinion among experts than a modest 10 per cent. We are not dealing with an exact science.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another complication which should be taken into account, namely, goodwill. It is very difficult in the retail scene—and I am sure the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Roper) is familiar with this—to separate goodwill from current use value when a major trader is established in a position for a long time. The property may be a large department store in a town. There may be a problem of determining the value of the property separately from the value of the goodwill which has been accumulated by the trader in that property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is only one of the many factors which can confuse the valuers and complicate the situation. It can lead to
	<span class='label label-info column'>366</span>
arguments and disagreements between experts as to what exact values are, but it is nonsense to suggest that one can determine current use value within an accuracy of 10 per cent. It is a theoretical figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is therefore ill-advised to resist this amendment so strongly. It is a very modest and reasonable amendment. He referred to the transaction being "free of tax". I am sure we would all be delighted to hear that all property transactions of whatever kind would be exempt from capital gains tax—I do not think that he was revealing Budget secrets, it would not be in his nature to do so—but non-development part of property transaction is still as I understand it liable to normal forms of taxation, so we are not talking about anything being free of tax. We are talking of being free of a special additional tax that applies to development only. Therefore I put it to the Minister that the nature of valuation is such that to try to squeeze the base value down to 110 per cent. of a theoretical figure is far too restrictive and that a very modest increase to 120 per cent. is entirely justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) and the Minister of State were outside the room during our discussion on Amendment No. 48 to which the Financial Secretary replied. Had they been here they would have heard me argue in exactly the contrary sense on the point of valuation to which the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend have just argued, which is that it is possible to establish valuation dates at any point of time and that is why Amendment No. 48 should have been accepted. However, we did not prevail in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also took the opportunity to read into the record only two or three lines of calculation No. 2 of the development land tax calculations by Johnson and Westlake, to which my hon. Friend referred, I thought that to give more than two lines would be an unreasonable burden on both the time and patience of the Committee and the comprehension of HANSARD. After the calculations had gone on for two pages, we are still not told at the end what the tax payable is. We are told what the chargeable gain is but the actual calculation of tax is not given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0766">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>367</span>
As the hon. Gentleman has already said that he is prepared to accept the amendments, I suppose that the purpose of the exercise is for us to get him to think again. I can think of only one way of doing that, and that is by suggesting that the loss to the Revenue might be minimal if this amendment were accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a number of calculations worked out. I hasten to say that they are much simpler than those of Johnson and Westlake, and they deal with the sort of case which is likely to arise more frequently in housebuilding than those that they were considering, such as warehouse development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider first the case of base A in which 10 acres of land were purchased in July 1973, without planning consent, but with a considerable degree of hope value, planning consent being obtained after 12th September, 1974, and in which the development is eventually commenced—that is, deemed development, or, alternatively, the land is sold and therefore is an actual disposal in August 1976.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The market value at the commencement of the development is, say £200,000. Now we have the offsets under base A. First, there is the purchase price of £5,000 per acre—I said it had a good deal of hope value—so it is £50,000. The increase in current use value 1973–1976 is, say, £200 an acre, making £2,000. There is no expenditure on improvements. There is a special addition under Clause 6 to base value A at 15 per cent. for four years which works out at £30,000. That all comes to £82,000. To that we have to add the £10,000 first-slice exemption, making £92,000 altogether in what one may call disregards, which have to be set against the £200,000 purchase price. We thus have a taxable figure of £108,000. Since it is under £150,000 it is taxed at 66⅔ per cent., and so the total tax in this example under base A would be £72,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bases B and C, which I shall give in a moment, would both show a higher figure, and therefore obviously the taxpayer would not accept them. But, of course, that higher figure depends to a considerable extent on the existence of the 15 per cent. for four years' special value, and whereas even after the calculation is completed in fact the taxpayer would still choose base A in this particular example, it would have been easy to alter the example in such a way as to make B or C more interesting. Let us do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>368</span>
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us take, for example, base B. Again the market value is £200,000, In this case, the current use value in 1976 was £12,000. We add 10 per cent. as in the Bill at present—£1,200—and let us say £1,000 for improvements, which makes £14,200. We then add the £10,000 exemption, thus making £24,200 in disregards. We thus have a taxable figure of £175,800, of which £150,000 would be taxed at 66⅔ per cent., making £100,000, and £25,800 at 80 per cent., making £20,640—a total tax, payable on a 110 per cent. basis as in the Bill at present, of £120,640.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the 120 per cent. basis, which we commend in the example of base B, the taxable figure would be £174,600 which, after the split between the £150,000 and the rest of it, would mean a tax burden of £119,680 compared with £120,640 under the Bill as it stands, so the difference is very small and the Revenue is hardly disadvantaged.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under case C, again the market value is £200,000. This time we are assuming that the land was acquired in 1960 for £8,000 but that in 1964 £5,000 was spent on drainage and in 1972 £1,000 was spent on clearing trees and hedgerows from the sites. The cost of improvements and acquisition is £14,000. We add 10 per cent.—£1,400—making £15,400. With £10,000 exemption, the total disregard is £25,400. The taxable figure, therefore, is £174,600. Under the Bill at present, £119,680 will actually be payable and, under our amendment, at 120 per cent. the total tax would be £118,560.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In both examples of the use of base B and C, the amount of difference to the Revenue of making the concession which we propose would be very small.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may say that these examples on the basis of £200,000 are subject to a whole series of assumptions. But these are fairly typical examples. They are not complex like those of Johnson and Westlake concerning the warehouse, and so on. They are simple examples which have been worked out by people concerned with these practical problems near to their work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point I was trying to make in each case was that, although, as it happens in the examples which I gave, even after taking account of the Clause 6 special addition base A would probably still be the most advantageous for the taxpayer, nevertheless it would have been possible
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0767">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>369</span>
to complicate the examples so as to make B or C more desirable to him. In those cases, acceptance of the amendment moved by my hon. Friend for Hitchin (Mr. Stewart) would not only bring the Bill into line with development gains tax which, as he said, was a very reasonable suggestion, but would also involve a minimal loss to the Revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree to think about this matter again. The whole purpose of our debates here is to try to bring to bear upon the Government the feelings of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. We feel strongly on this matter and it is one that we hope the Minister will look at again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nick Budgen</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have one question to pose to the Minister on the first part of the clause, where it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"one of the following which gives the highest figure."</p></blockquote>
Are we to understand from that that the Revenue would be under a duty to make estimates upon all three bases and then to advise the taxpayer as to which it regarded as the most favourable to him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can try to deal with the many points that have been raised on the amendment and deal with the last point first. The hon. Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) dealt at considerable length with the poor taxpayer who is not well advised and who does not know whether to choose between base A, B and C, and who, when he has chosen, does not know whether he has made the right choice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answer is that the taxpayer will get the best tax advice in the United Kingdom—namely, the Inland Revenue. He will get it free, as well, which is an added bonus. He will not have to use some of these expensive accountants who do not always get it right either. The Inland Revenue will do it for him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Though the Inland Revenue may have excellent qualifications, I am sure the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that it is necessarily impartial or unbiased towards the taxpayer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my experience, the Revenue is very fair to the taxpayer. It is extremely good and courteous at the work carried out. Of course, it is possible for
	<span class='label label-info column'>370</span>
the vendor to use professional advisers. My experience of poor vendors who sell large chunks of land is that they are not backward in getting the very best professional advice. Therefore, it is not a question of electing between bases. It is a question of getting one's entitlement. The Revenue will provide its figures to show which is the most favourable to the taxpayer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) raised a number of queries. At the end of his speech I was left wondering why we give 10 per cent. at all to base C. I had accepted this before as being the way these matters should be dealt with. The only reason the hon. Gentleman gave for giving 10 per cent. to base C was inflation. Base B is different. We can accept that income has current use value and that surveying is an art and not a science, therefore it might be difficult to arrive at current use value. We say that a 10 per cent. uplift is sufficient to take account of that problem. Some hon. Gentlemen will say 20 per cent. We can argue about the figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we come to base C, my eyes have been opened in this Committee. Base C merely refers to the cost of acquisition. So there is no reason why we should give 10 per cent. extra on the cost of acquisition, because there is no problem here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This approach by the Inland Revenue will be alarming to anybody who has anything to do with industry and commerce. The Minister of State appears to be suggesting that money is interest-free. If that is the approach, no wonder industrialists and others are discouraged from investing. Not only are they told that they will not be allowed to make any profit on it by the arbitrary and restrictive nature of the Price Code, but if the approach is that the investment is to be regarded as entirely interest-free when it comes to tax purposes I would have thought it has the most alarming consequences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman misses the point. I know of no other tax provision where costs can be uplifted by 10 per cent. It would be very nice in income tax if one could add 10 per cent. to one's costs in producing goods. I know of no provision in the tax legislation which allows an extra 10 per cent. I know of no provision zin capital gains tax legislation which allows an uplift over the cost. It is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0768">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>371</span>
very nice to have it and we do not propose to withdraw it. The only reason the hon. Gentleman could give was interst rate charges, and I quite understand his point. But the point he was making was about inflation and indexation. Of course that could apply to the whole of taxation, and there are important arguments for and against that concept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards base C, the 10 per cent. is a gratuitous increase. It is not related to the difficulty of assessing the base cost, because the base cost is the cost of acquisition. Nevertheless, I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we have no intention of withdrawing the 10 per cent. and it will be left as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to base C. I accept that there are arguments, which the hon. Gentleman has deployed, whereby the increase should be more than 10 per cent.—some people say because of the problems of valuation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Sainsbury</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Base B?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I meant base B. We say that 10 per cent. is a sufficient tolerance to take these matters into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the problems of local authorities. He drew a picture of local authority committees having to work out bases A, B and C and the difficulties of doing so. I assure him again that local authorities will not have, and do not have, to do the computations on that basis. Local authorities must operate only the net-of-tax provisions which, if he reads my speech on Second Reading, as I am sure that he has done on several occasions, he will see apply in relation to 110 per cent. current use value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only problem—and in some cases there may be a problem to a local authority—is to agree a current use value. Then an uplift of 110 per cent. of the net of tax deduction is done on that basis. The Revenue, as I have said, will make all the other complicated calculations for the poor, unfortunate taxpayer. So there is no need to worry on that score.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Melton (Mr. Latham) read out an interesting calculation and came to an answer to which he no doubt wished to come. He pointed out that there was little tax lost in the calculation. One could, of course, draw up different calculations. The Inland Revenue could provide a large number of
	<span class='label label-info column'>372</span>
calculations which would compete with the computations of Messrs. Johnson and Westlake and which might conclude that a lot of tax is lost to the Revenue. So there is little to gain in pursuing such an argument. As I have said on base C, 10 per cent. is fair and reasonable in relation to an uplift on cost of acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On base B, 10 per cent. is sufficient to provide for the difficulties of valuation which may occur in some cases. In other cases it will not be difficult to value. Few cases, in fact, go to the Lands Tribunal The cases that do go there are normally the most difficult ones. Most cases are not that difficult in relation to current use value. We think that 10 per cent. is a sufficient ulpift and I cannot recommend acceptance of these amendments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister in his first speech in reply to these amendments said that these percentages were not intended as a further relief from taxation. But in relation to base C, the decrease from 20 per cent., which was recognised for capital gains tax, to the 10 per cent. on base C in the Bill, is an increase in taxation, because it is being taxed now on the basis of development land tax rates instead of on capital gainst tax rates. So merely by change of mind—that now we will have 10 per cent. and not 20 per cent., for which the Minister has given no reason, except that it will bring in extra taxation—we are asked to accept that increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that at times he is asked "Why do you follow the 1974 Act on development gainst tax?" or "Why do you not follow it?" I take the point. In Amendment No. 71 we are trying to follow the development gains tax. In Amendment No. 59 we go against it. We do so because the Government accepted that 20 per cent. was the right figure in the case of what was base A in the development gains tax and is now base C in the development land tax. But they recognised that 20 per cent. was the right addition. The Minister has given no reason why we should now abandon that figure. If that was right for base C, I see no reason why it should not be right for base B. That is why we have these two amendments on the Amendment Paper. The Minister said that the 10 per cent., in both base B and base C, although I think he mainly applied it to base C, was a gratuitous increase on the acquisition figure. But this has been recognised in previous
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0769">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>373</span>
legislation. Now the 20 per cent. is for some reason cut down to 10 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned about the point which deals with base B—Amendment No. 71—and the point which deals with base C—Amendment No. 59, and so I ask you, Mr. Bonner Pink, to be good enough to let us have a division on both those</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Graham Page</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To permit the Minister to find his brief, may I assist the Committee? Undoubtedly we consider, that these words arc tautologous. It is quite obvious that they are. The clause says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purpose of this Act, the cost of a person's acquisition of an interest in land, means…the amount or value of the consideration given by him or on his behalf…for the acquisition of that interest."</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<i>Question put,</i> That the amendment be made:—</p>
	<p>	<i>The Committee divided:</i> Ayes 9, Noes 9.</p>
	<p>It is either given or not given to the acquisition.</p>
	<p>Suppose the person is buying other land, and a sum of money is given for the relevant interest and some other interest, then if that money is given for two objects it may not be wholly or exclusively given for the one that we wish to be concerned with in the question of this tax. Is the whole of that consideration to be disregarded? Surely the clause is clear enough without these words. In fact, they only confuse the clause. Let the words be:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the consideration…for the acquisition of the interest,"</p></blockquote>
and just that. If a sum of money is paid at the same time for the acquisition of some other interest, surely we are not to say that that sum of money was not wholly and exclusively paid for the acquisition of the relevant interest and that, therefore, we cannot consider it at all; that it was a gift, that we have to turn to clause whatever it is and look at it as a part disposal or something of that sort.</p>
	<p>I am quite sure that these words only confuse the application of subsection (2).</p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1975-1976V009P0I0770">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Being even more simple than either my right hon. Friend or the Minister, I would like the Minister to tell us what he thinks it adds to the clause, or what he thinks it would subtract from it if we subtracted the words "wholly and exclusively".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These words are a term of art in law, usually used in other connections, but I would be interested to know what the Minister thinks they mean. He is saying that, if they are necessary, the words:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For the purposes of this Act, the cost of a person's acquisition of an interest in land means…the amount or value of the consideration given by him or on his behalf…for the acquisition of the interest"</p></blockquote>
must mean, that for the purposes of this Act, the cost of a person's acquisition of an interest in land means more or less than, but not
	<br><blockquote><p>"the amount or value of the consideration given by him''' for the acquisition of the interest".</p></blockquote>
In other words, English does not mean anything unless one says "wholly" or "exclusively".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I promise never again to move an amendment briefly. Clearly, one should move an amendment at length, in order to explain it, to give the Minister time to think about it, or to find his brief, or to give some reason to the Committee as to why he should read his brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I could have done what my right hon. Friend did, though not so eloquently, and explained the reasons why I think that these words add nothing to the subsection. Either the consideration is given, or it is not given. I suspect that the reality is that this is rather like the word "thereof", which I discussed on "Clause 3 stand part", when the Minister said that it was an example of words that the draftsman loves to include and that we must not take his sweets away from him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairbairn</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not wholly and exclusively an example.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Latham</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend, as usual, has put his finger firmly on the point. Now, perhaps, after a more lengthy diversion, the Minister will read his brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Denzil Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. and learned Gentleman said, these words are very common in other contexts. They are
	<span class='label label-info column'>376</span>
very common in taxation contexts, and consideration and expenses are deducted where they are falling exclusively for certain purchases or for such expenditures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The learned Gentleman will find, if he reads through the taxation cases, even the Court of Session cases, that there have been arguments in the past which have led draftsmen to put in words of this kind in order to prevent arguments from arising before the courts as to whether a certain consideration was for an acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept entirely that on the face of it, it looks as if almost all considerations for the acquisition of an asset must be wholly and exclusively. But I dare say there have been situations in the past when consideration has been split: where payments have been made separately from, perhaps, a contract or a conveyance, where it could be argued on a fairly loose interpretation of language. The kind of rough justice which the hon. and learned Gentleman wants us to adopt in taxation legislation—that it was for the acquisition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But the words "wholly and exclusively" make it more precise. It is, I believe, necessary to be precise in taxation legislation for the benefit of both parties—for the benefit, not only of the Revenue, but of the taxpayers' advisers. They prefer precision in taxation legislation because it makes it easier for everybody to advise with a certain amount of certainty.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I will go back and we will ask the parliamentary draftsman whether he thinks it is absolutely necessary to have these words. If he say that he thinks that it is, we must bow to the advice of the parliamentary draftsman. But if he says, like the hon. Gentleman, that he has come to the conclusion that it is tautologous we will ask him whether we can take the words out. I cannot give a better assurance than that to the Committee. I think the words are probably necessary. Personally, I prefer to see them in because it gives greater certainty. However, if on consideration the parliamentary draftsman says that they are not necessary we shall consider taking them out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move Amendment No. 41, in page 6, line 20, leave out from 'effect' to end of line 29 and insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>'as if the chargeable person and the person from whom he acquired his interest ("the connected person") were a single person so that—
	<ol>
	<li>the references to cost and expenditure in that subsection shall be taken to mean the aggregate of the cost or other expenditure as the case may be, incurred by both the chargeable person and the connected person and</li>
	<li>the tax payable by the connected person as a result of his disposal shall be treated as a payment on account of the tax payable on the disposal by the chargeable person.</li>
</ol></p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>(6) Where subsection (5) above applies the connected person shall be liable for so much of the tax as would have arisen on his disposal if subsection (5) above had not been enacted and the chargeable person shall be liable for the amount by which the tax payable on his disposal exceeds that amount referred to above '.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->: With this we shall take Government Amendment No. 58.</p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>378</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Stewart</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As drafted, subsection (5) relates to the case of a person acquiring an interest in land from another person who is connected with him as defined in the capital gains tax legislation. If such is the case, and if the person who makes the acquisition disposes of that interest within a year of the acquisition, the special addition under base A, the 10 per cent. addition of current use value in base B, and the 10 per cent. additional cost for base C are disallowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has indicated that he will speak to Amendment No. 58, which seeks to leave out lines 24 and 25 on page 6. That means that the part relating to base B and the 110 per cent. of current use value is allowed to stand in these cases. We are therefore dealing with a clause which, if Amendment No. 58 is carried, relates only to base A and the special additions, and base C with the 10 per cent. addition to acquisition costs.
