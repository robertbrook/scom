	<div class='legislation'>Draft Rates (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998</div> <!-- legislation -->

	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Rates (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
This could be the last Northern Ireland rating legislation made under the Order-in-Council procedure. As the Committee will know, rates will be a transferred function. The new Assembly will be responsible for all future initiatives in the Province that relate to rating and valuation. In the meantime, however, it is important that the legislation is kept fully up to date. The order is intended to do just that. I am sure that members of the Committee have read the order and recognise the great similarity between the changes that have recently been made in Great Britain and those which the order will make in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 removes an entitlement to a reduction in the amount of rates that are chargeable following a revaluation during any period in which an increased valuation is under appeal. At present, the maximum rate that is recoverable during the appeal period is restricted to the sum of the previous year's rate bill and to 75 per cent. of any increase due to the revaluation. The change removes from Northern Ireland legislation a provision that has no equivalent in Great Britain rates or council tax law. Should a new valuation be reduced on appeal, any overpaid rates will be refunded in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where the owner of—or, more usually, the rental agent for—a property rather than the occupier has agreed in writing to pay the rates, article 4 reduces the different allowances or discounts that are available from three to one. At present, a 7.5 per cent, allowance is available where an owner or agent agrees to pay the rates only in relation to periods of occupancy. In certain circumstances, that enables owners to claim rate refunds for past periods of vacancy, long after tenants have reoccupied the property. Because of the many properties involved, the facts relating to alleged earlier vacant periods might be difficult or, sometimes, impossible to establish. The system is open to abuse and requires further regulation. That is why the order deals with the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 7.5 per cent. allowance will be discontinued along with an obsolete 5 per cent. allowance, which no agent has claimed in 25 years. Agents who agree to pay the full year's rates—whether or not a property is continuously occupied throughout the year—will continue to qualify for a 10 per cent. allowance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Articles 5, 6 and 9 mirror changes that were introduced in Great Britain by the Local Government and Rating Act 1997, which the previous Government introduced and with which the Labour party agreed. It deals particularly with rural areas, where it is important to establish and maintain post offices or general stores to ensure that the community and the community spirit are kept alive. Consequently, following representations to us from political parties and others in Northern Ireland, we believe that it is a good idea for the relevant legislation in Great Britain to be extended to Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 should be read in conjunction with schedule 1. They provide for a scheme of rate relief in rural settlements. Schedule 1 requires the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland to maintain a list of rural settlements. It provides for the only general store or post office in such settlements to benefit from a 50 per cent. reduction in rates. It also enables the Department of the Environment, in certain circumstances, to grant relief, at its discretion, of the full amount of the rates on such properties. The same is true for properties whose use is considered to benefit the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 is in line with changes that are to be introduced in Great Britain. It provides for all Crown property in Northern Ireland, which consists mainly of Government offices, to be subject to rates. The practice whereby the Government make contributions in lieu of rates will be discontinued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 exempts from rate liability buildings used for the scientific testing of live stock and poultry for the purpose of identifying top breeders. That will especially assist the pig industry at a very difficult time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 will enable the parts of prisons used primarily by prisoners to be valued and rated as being used for domestic purposes and will be subject, therefore, to domestic rates. Such areas include cells, libraries and kitchens. The rest of a prison, used for security and administration, will be liable for non-domestic rates. This change is intended to bring Northern Ireland legislation into line with that of Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 9 removes the liability of sporting rights to rates. Sporting rights that are separate from the occupation of land and which are valued in their own right will be removed from the valuation list. Rights that are currently valued with the land will no longer be reflected in its rateable value.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 10 and schedule 2 make minor technical and consequential changes, none of which affect ratepayers directly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 11 is necessary to enable the Foyle Fisheries Commission to continue to levy its fisheries rate after the general exemption of sporting rights under article 9. Otherwise, the commission would have to forgo a small but important source of revenue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order brings Northern Ireland into line with changes in the rating system that have occurred in the rest of the United Kingdom. As I said, the order may be the last rating order to be considered by the House before devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before we proceed, I should like to remind the Committee that although the Chairman always appreciates that hon. Members find it convenient to open their morning post specifically to determine whether they have received letters relating directly to the matters before them, it would be helpful if they could do so quietly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.37 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order is not terribly important in the usual run of things in Northern Ireland. It will, however, affect many people, and, as the Minister said, it may be the last order relating to rates to go through the Order-in-Council procedure, because it deals with a transferred matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the Assembly will be—we hope—up and running in the new year, why could not the matter have been allowed to remain for the Assembly to deal with at its convenience? The order seems to contain nothing to necessitate its being rushed through at the eleventh hour before the Assembly is set up. Will the Minister explain why he deems it important for the order to be considered now?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask some specific questions. Article 3 refers to article 12 of the principal order. Does it remove a form of capping—a limit on the extra rates that would be payable when a revaluation had occurred? That leads to the question whether revaluation of businesses or of domestic premises is likely to occur in Northern Ireland in the near future. Are the Government seeking to make substantial increases in the rate payable because of such revaluation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Specific aspects of Government expenditure are relevant. I refer especially to the water services, which are under tremendous pressure because of the capital programme to bring in and to improve water quality and sewerage facilities. It is well known that the Government are in danger of incurring infraction proceedings through the European courts because they are not meeting European standards. Do the Government need to increase rates—the general rate, in particular—to help pay for some of the very expensive capital projects that are necessary? Is the change to ensure that when revaluation is introduced—if it is introduced—the increased rates payable will flow into the Government's coffers while those who have been revalued appeal but in the interim do not pay the increased rates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4(a)(i) refers to rates being charged on a property
	<br><blockquote><p>"whether it is occupied or not".</p></blockquote>
Is that an attempt to bring into use many of the empty and often derelict properties in rural Northern Ireland by forcing the owners either to cough up rates or to improve them and let them out for rent, which would help pay the rates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That raises the question of who is technically the owner of a property. The Housing Executive, which runs the social housing in Northern Ireland, has many empty properties in certain areas. As the owner of such
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
properties, would the Housing Executive be liable for the rates on unoccupied housing stock? That raises questions regarding the amount payable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are happy to go along with the relief on rates for certain hereditaments in rural settlements, particularly for general stores; the previous Government introduced that provision for England and Wales. But in respect of schedule 1, how will the Government define a settlement with a population of not more than 3,000? Is a settlement just the built-up area comprising the housing and the village? Is it the parish area? Is it a nominated part of the district council area? I envisage considerable problems with such a definition. Obviously, every small settlement and hamlet will want its general store to benefit from the rate relief, but there will be problems in terms of which settlements are entitled to it. Will the Minister give us some clarification on the matter?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 is headed "Pig testing station". That puzzles me, because neither paragraphs (a) or (b) contain a reference to pigs. The article refers to poultry and to the scientific testing of livestock or poultry. Will the Minister enlighten us as to the reason for that title? It would be more sensible to have a title such as "livestock testing stations", as that would embrace pigs, cattle and any other livestock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, article 8 is about the rating of prisons. The Minister said that the provision would bring matters in Northern Ireland into line with those pertaining in England and Wales. Given the current situation in Northern Ireland, where the prisons are emptying at a rate of knots, why are we bothering to do this? Some of the prisons will be empty in the near future, and will probably close. Does the Minister have any idea of what sort of revenue is likely to be raised as a result of the change to rating those parts of prisons that are occupied by the inmates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should be grateful if the Minister would either answer my questions today or write to me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.45 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the order, but I am always surprised that when the Government introduce orders covering Northern Ireland, they argue for parity with the rest of the United Kingdom. Many of their policies are designed to take Northern Ireland out of the United Kingdom and not to maintain parity with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Articles 3 and 4 are welcome, as is article 6 on Crown property, and I presume that there will be a revaluation for general rates in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 refers to living accommodation in prisons, which, presumably, are not covered at the moment because they are Crown property. The order removes Crown property status and prisons will become liable to rates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 covers general stores. Schedule 1 of the order requires the Department to compile and maintain a list of rural settlements. Will the Minister tell us in which year the list will be introduced, what preparations have been made for its compilation and whether there will be consultation before the lists are accepted?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0009">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
Schedule 1 refers to rural settlements in which there is only one general store. Many small settlements have only a post office and a few houses, but they are likely to have more than one general store and perhaps the Minister will clarify that. Perhaps he will also clarify the description of a general store.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is welcome. It is likely to increase valuations in Northern Ireland and allow more expenditure by local government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.48 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Jonathan Sayeed 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Bedfordshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 9 of the order deals with sporting rights and is limited to
	<br><blockquote><p>"fowling, shooting, taking or killing game or rabbits, or"</p></blockquote>
fishing. Do those sporting rights extend to hunting with dogs and why are they so limited? Why should not golf and other sporting activities be included?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.49 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank hon. Members for generally supporting the order and specifically the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss). He asked why the order was being introduced now when the Assembly may be sitting by February. Some of the measures result directly from representations made by political parties in Northern Ireland, especially the Ulster Unionists, on rural areas. I am sure that the hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) was right to welcome the order because the measures will have a good effect in Great Britain and we believe that they should be repeated in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want measures such as the ending of contributions in lieu of the rating of Crown buildings to be on approximately the same timetable as the rest of Britain. It is administratively convenient for such changes to take place at the same time. There is nothing sinister in that. I believe that the Assembly would welcome the measures contained in the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to article 3 and capping. Article 3 contains no form of cap. He also referred to article 12 of the principal rates legislation, which article 3 of the order repeals. Article 12 provides that, where rates have increased because of a new valuation list, and where a valuation in that list has been appealed, a ratepayer may withhold 25 per cent. of the difference between a new rate bill and the last bill received before the enforcement of the new list, until that appeal and any subsequent appeals have been disposed of.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The points that the hon. Gentleman made about revaluation are valid. He knowns that the long wait for revaluation—some 20 years—has caused considerable dismay in Northern Ireland. Because of that long wait, small businesses in particular faced considerable increases. I have said publicly in Northern Ireland that I would ensure that ratepayers would not face such dramatic rises in future by greatly reducing the length of time between revaluations. I hope that my successor in the Assembly, whoever that might be, will make a similar assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
The hon. Gentleman also made reference—again, rightly—to water and sewerage. Certainly, the proposals for an increase in the regional rate in Northern Ireland that the Government are making for next year's Budget, which I presented to the Assembly some weeks ago, and with which the Northern Ireland Grand Committee will deal next week, seek to use some of that rating revenue to tackle the water and sewerage problem in Northern Ireland. Although revaluation will not itself solve the problem, rating revenue must be used to help to overcome it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for dealing with that matter in so much detail, but I should like him to clarify certain points. He has proposed that the regional rate should pay for important and necessary capital works, particularly in the water industry. If there is to be no revaluation, from where will the extra money come? Is he suggesting that we rob Peter to pay Paul—that we redistribute the rate, and give more to water and less to other areas? Or is the rate poundage to be increased to yield the extra money for water?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Paul Murphy</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense, as time goes by, both. Clearly, when the revaluation is made, the amount brought in by way of rate poundage will increase. It is then for the Assembly to decide whether it wishes to raise the regional rate, which is the only means by which it can generate its own income. More income would therefore be available from the rates to spend on the important problem of water and sewage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Revaluation distributes money in a different way, but it does not necessarily produce more money. Decisions on how much money to raise—and, indeed, on whether rate revenue should be used, as far as the law permits, to tackle the water and sewerage problem—are therefore political ones for the Assembly to take.

The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire raised some matters regarding article 4, and the removal of the 7.5 per cent. allowance. As I think I said, too many properties are involved, and tenants change too often. Some 350 owners claim the 7.5 per cent. allowance on more than 9,000 properties. An owner may claim the allowance up to the end of September, and declare any number of vacant periods for the preceding six months. As the hon. Gentleman will understand, the rating authorities have insufficient resources to conduct detailed investigations into such matters. Such a procedure could in any case be open to abuse.

The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire rightly raised the further issue of defining a settlement. There is no precise definition of rural settlement, but the Department of the Environment is required to publish a list of proposed settlements, identifying in each case the boundaries. The population of the rural settlement must not exceed 3,000. Such a list, if published, will be open for all to see.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As for pig testing stations, the type of pig testing carried out in Antrim is widely carried out in Great Britain. However, in Great Britain the testing is done on selected farms. The procedure is therefore not rated in Great Britain because the farms themselves are exempt. It is because Northern Ireland has the only purpose-built testing station on a fixed site in the United Kingdom that the problems arises.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to the rating of prisons. The annual saving for the Northern Ireland Prison Service is estimated to be about £250,000. It is not possible to be precise because the valuation exercise has not taken place. I take his more general point about business, which doubtless we will be able to debate in a wider context at another time. As for the Housing Executive, an arrangement exists for it to pay rates whether properties are occupied or not. I can tell him that it qualifies for a 10 per cent. allowance, so I need not write to him on that matter.

I am grateful for the welcome that the hon. Member for West Tyrone gave to the changes introduced by the order. It will benefit areas such as his constituency, which is large and rural. In my response to the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, I briefly mentioned the list that will be published. The hon. Member for West Tyrone asked what will happen if there is more than one store. We have again followed legislation that applies in Britain. It is not possible for two stores or two post offices in the same rural
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
settlement each to get mandatory relief, the purpose of which is to ensure that a sparsely populated rural area has either a post office or a general store. If a second store opens part of the way through a financial year, the store already in receipt of mandatory relief will lose the relief but no change will be made until the end of that financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Tyrone asked when that will take place. There is a great deal of work to be done in identifying the settlements. A scheme cannot commence until at least three months after the proposed rural settlement list has been published and it will be difficult administratively to commence a scheme in the middle of a financial year. It is unlikely therefore that a scheme will come into effect until 1 April 2000.

The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed) asked about hunting with dogs. The order does not apply to that but specifically to other sports. It brings Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the country. We want to ensure that there is no difference between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I shall write to him with the reasons for our decision in respect of sports, including golf.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
