	<div class='title'>DUTY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO SURVEY WATERCOURSES</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Chisholm 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, Leith)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 22, in page 1, line 10, after 'area', insert
	<br><blockquote><p>'with a known risk of flooding'.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this we may discuss Government amendments Nos. 11 and 12.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said in the Scottish Grand Committee in Edinburgh, we welcome the clause, which is about turning "can" into "must" for local authorities. We welcome also the Government amendments which will replace surveys with assessments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main issues discussed in Edinburgh was how much money would be available for the work related to clauses 1 and 2. We were told by the Minister that £3 million would be available. My concern, and the aim of the amendment, is that that money should properly be targeted and that we should have regard to cost benefit in using that money. It would not be an efficient or effective use of resources to survey all watercourses in any one local authority area. In an area such as the highlands, it would probably be impossible to survey—or, as we now saying, assess—all the watercourses. The amendment contains a solution to that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I emphasise the point about money because it was one of the main aspects of the debate on Second Reading. Some £3 million has been given and should be used in the most sensible way possible. I will not digress at length about whether that £3 million is real money—that transgresses on to the general local government finance debates which we have had and which we will have more of in the next two weeks. In a sense that money is notional money because there will be a cash cut in local authority budgets next year
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
and local authorities may struggle even to spend £3 million. Assuming that they will spend that amount, we must make sure that they use the money in the most effective way possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various solutions to the problem have been suggested. For example, the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency—SEPA—suggests that the duty should be limited to surveying watercourses where
	<br><blockquote><p>"cleansing, repairing and otherwise maintaining"</p></blockquote>
activities might be effective. That suggestion is even more restrictive than the one that I am putting forward. Another solution, suggested by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, is that there should be surveys only of built-up areas. There are problems in defining a built-up area. I am mindful of the amendments in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Mr. Galbraith), in which he points out problems that might arise in agricultural areas and have knock-on effects in built-up areas. There are problems with that formulation, although I understand the point that COSLA is trying to make. Perhaps the Minister can clarify exactly where he wants activities to be targeted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The formulation that I have put forward relates to areas
	<br><blockquote><p>"with a known risk of flooding"</p></blockquote>
because it is well known which watercourses and which parts of particular watercourses are most likely to cause trouble. The most effective use of resources would be to target the survey or assessment on those watercourses. The clause says that that is to be done "from time to time." Perhaps the Minister can clarify exactly what that means—it could mean an abundance of things. If we properly target watercourses with a known risk of flooding, we could carry out far more frequent inspections. It may well be difficult, however, regularly to inspect every watercourse in the highlands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that activities should be concentrated so that the formulation "from time to time" would mean frequent assessments in critical areas. That would be the most effective way to reduce the risk of flooding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill Walker 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Tayside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The subject of the amendments and the clause is important. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will know of my interest in the Tay flooding problem. The Committee has many interesting items before it, including delightful maps, sketches and other helpful things, but there is nothing about the Tay. The flooding problems there are probably some of the greatest in Scotland. Houses the length of the Tay are liable to flooding, and have recently been flooded. I want to be sure, therefore, that the clause and the amendments catch the Tay.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. George Kynoch)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, may I welcome you, Mrs. Winterton, as the Chairman of what I hope will be the brief Committee stage of a largely uncontroversial Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Sam Galbraith 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strathkelvin and Bearsden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good. The Minister has said enough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I note that the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden says that I have said enough, but I think that he will be interested in the Government's response to one or two of the points that were raised on Second Reading and in consultation thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall speak as briefly as I can on the amendments. The Committee will have seen that the Government propose to change the term "surveyed" to "assessed". Before dealing with that, I shall deal with amendment No. 22, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amendment would limit the amount of work that councils will have to do in "assessing" watercourses—if that term is agreed—by allowing them to assess only those with a known history of flooding. While, on the face of it, that may seem acceptable, flooding is unpredictable. It is not always those watercourses with a known history of flooding which flood. The condition of a watercourse is not static. Among other things, trees can fall into channels, debris can build up, vegetation and tree growth can occur, and screens can become blocked, all of which can result in restrictions of channel capacity and thereby increase the risk of flooding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there are concerns that councils face the prospect of litigation if a comprehensive assessment is not carried out on a watercourse, or part of one, and flooding occurs in that area. The Government's view is that that would hinge on a test of reasonableness. Councils that act reasonably in the light of information available to determine their priorities and the period between, and the extent of, each assessment will not be likely to be successfully sued. The extent of an assessment and prioritising watercourses to be assessed will depend on local circumstances. Local councils are best placed to make such decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the nature of the work to be done, it was never the Government's intention that duty should be an onerous or necessarily technical task. Following receipt of representations on that point, we propose to clarify the provision by replacing the term "surveyed" with "assessed" in clause 1 and "a survey" with "an assessment" in clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith referred to the £3 million allocation to assist in assessments, and I am sure that he will return to the matter, as is his wont because he has an obsession with local government funding. He referred once again to cuts in local government expenditure and funding this year—this is not directly relevant to our proceedings, although it is relevant if the hon. Gentleman says something that is not strictly correct. I am sure, however, that he in fact accepts that we have increased funding for local government. Indeed, his party—or at least the right hon. Member for Dunfermline, East (Mr. Brown)—has suggested that should a Labour Government come to power they would not increase the funding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Port Glasgow)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that many of my constituents are from time to time inconvenienced, although not perhaps as severely as other citizens, by burns running
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
too heavily after rain, what is the Minister's definition of the phrase "from time to time" contained in clause 1? Is not that a little woolly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Local authorities must make their own assessment of what is most practical in their particular areas. The Bill is about trying to ensure that local authorities carry out what they had powers to do in the past but will have duties to do in future. That came about because it was apparent in some of the flooded areas that I visited—certainly those in Kilmarnock to which the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. McKelvey) took me 18 months ago and for which Strathclyde regional council was responsible—that some councils had not done as much work as others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leads me to the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for North Tayside (Mr. Walker). He will be aware that in Perth and Kinross the flooding problem has been addressed. I understand that applications have been made under the challenge fund for capital for a flooding prevention scheme. That will be assessed in due course. The provisions apply to all local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To complete my response to the hon. Member for Leith, I have made available to the Committee the figures on the distribution of grant-aided expenditure for flood prevention and coast protection. They may be of interest to him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have clarified the Government's intentions. We do not intend that all watercourses with the potential to flood non-agricultural land must be visited in any one year. That leads on from the points made by the hon. Member for Leith about frequency. It is intended, however, that they should all be assessed "from time to time". In that respect, it will be for councils to determine their priorities and the way in which they undertake assessments in the light of local circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already spoken about amendments Nos. 11 and 12—but the Government never intended that the duty to survey should be onerous or necessarily technical. I ask the hon. Member for Leith to withdraw amendment No. 22.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to the test of reasonableness when considering such matters. As money is relevant to the Bill, the same test should be applied to his remarks about local government finance. He said that I am obsessed with it. I am proud to be so and my obsession will continue next week in Montrose at the Scottish Grand Committee, and whenever we are allowed to debate the matter on the Floor of the House—either next week or the week after.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister keeps repeating his piece of fiction about increased funding, but there has been a cash reduction. He gets rid of that by adding money from disappearing old burdens—£26 million for nursery education, which I accept, and £60 million for local government reorganisation savings, which I do not accept.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My simple point about adding money from disappearing old burdens is that new burdens must be subtracted from the sum available. If he is saying that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
the cash cut disappears because money does not have to be spent on nursery education, he must appreciate that, in the opposite direction, he must take account of the new expenditure burdens relating to flooding, school security, community care and the police. That is why there is an inconsistency in the logic of the Government's approach. It fails the test of reasonableness.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will withdraw the amendment if the Minister assures me that the Government will, first, write to local authorities setting out what he said about the threat of litigation and, secondly, give guidance to local authorities about what "from time to time" means. The Minister said that there would be no obligation to assess rivers every year, but that must be clarified—local authorities are concerned that they may face litigation. If the Minister is willing to issue guidance to local authorities, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not be persuaded to carry on the dabate about local government funding, which the hon. Member for Leith has been trying to pursue. We must agree to differ. The difference between us is that the Government believe in prioritisation, while the hon. Gentleman believes in giving in and giving increased funding, regardless.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, the phrase "from time to time" is woolly. Why not prescribe an annual survey?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman must appreciate that a balance needs to be struck. Conditions in some areas may well necessitate an annual assessment, whereas it may not be necessary in other areas. It is therefore best left to local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the final point of the hon. Member for Leith, once the Bill is on the statute book I will be happy to write to local authorities outlining what I have said today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 1 deals with the problem of riparian owners' responsibility for maintaining watercourses. It was not clear from the original Bill
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
what would happen—it seemed that the local authority would take over the statutory duty to maintain watercourses even when they fell within private land. We thought that that was unacceptable. The Minister has conceded that point and has introduced amendment No. 13 to deal with the matter. The first part of my amendment has therefore been adequately dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part is directed at another problem, that of riparian owners not maintaining their watercourses and defences, thus causing agricultural land to flood, as a result of which the water spreads to urban land. I wanted to ensure that if the riparian owners were not maintaining their watercourses, the local authority could instruct them so to do. What recourse is there in dealing with riparian owners who do not maintain watercourses or defences, leading to flooding of the urban land? That is the case in Kirkintilloch, where the Kelvin floods over Caledonian estate's land into either local authority or private urban land. We must know whether there are powers to deal with that problem. I have tried to deal with it on numerous occasions in the past, but it gets bandied around various Departments, with no one accepting responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed section 4D in amendment No. 2 would prevent riparian owners from carrying out any work without the permission of the local authority. I raise this issue partly in relation to my area. The Park burn is a minor tributary of the River Kelvin, and the riparian owner, Caledonian estate, has built up a bund on its side of the burn to prevent flooding of the agricultural land. As a result of the bund, which I understand has been built up without planning permission, the water is pushed across into the urban area, going into people's gardens, houses and kitchens. It regularly floods houses, but not the agricultural land, because the bund is small and does not require planning permission. No one should be able to develop flood defences without considering the effect on others. I should be grateful if the Minister would consider that proposal; I do not need an answer now, but perhaps he could let me know at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I see that with clause 2, we are also taking amendment No. 3, which deals with consultation with SEPA and Scottish Natural Heritage. Consultation with SEPA is necessary, because of its involvement with pollution problems, and with Scottish Natural Heritage, because the rivers drain marsh lands with effects on wildlife and conservation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry, Mrs. Winterton. With that, I conclude my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Connarty 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Falkirk, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I find the amendments attractive, considering the situation in my constituency, which may be relevant in many other constituencies. We do not have a major flood problem as is the case in Perthshire, Kilmarnock and even Bearsden and the surrounding areas, where there is constant flooding. I recall from previous work as
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
leader of the council that the Blane valley, for example, in Stirling district would flood regularly and the Blane would sometimes be a torrent, whereas most of the time it was mild.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am attracted to the idea that people cannot alter the flow of waters because it protects their own property. There is such a situation in my constituency, as the Minister will know. He has been corresponding with me about Mr. and Mrs. Blackstock of Rivendell, Avon Bridge Road, Slamannan, in Falkirk. The surrounding farm land has been drained at different times and the piping of the water coming out of the fields runs across a road and takes a 90 degree turn right in front of the cottage in which those people live. Every time there is a major downpour, the water gets into the cottage. It is quite severe, to the point where the lower part of the house is flooded on a regular basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would appear from my investigations that that drainage took place some time ago and that the farmers have in the past diverted the water away from their land in such a way that the cottage has been a regular point of flooding. That drainage system has been created for the farmers' protection and, no doubt, profit, but it has also been to the detriment of anyone living in the cottage. When the cottage was sold, the Blackstocks were not told that the diversions had taken place. They were subsequently flooded on a regular basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a letter to me of 4 December 1996, the Minister will recall—lucidly without having to refer to his notes—saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The effect of this legislation, if enacted, on the situation at Rivendell would be for the Council to determine."</p></blockquote>
In other words, the legislation will provide no protection at all unless the council—or other riparian owner—decides that it must accept some responsibility in the matter and takes steps to reimburse the Blackstock family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill is inadequate, so the amendment is necessary to protect people from the consequences of other people's diversions. In this particular case, I am not sure that it would affect riparian owners since it would apply to people who are trying to take water out of their agricultural land by a drainage system which, instead of going straight into the burn nearby, sometimes runs straight through this couple's property. It caused serious damage and they have spent a fortune trying to remedy the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The couple went public because they were so angered, but it means that their house is probably unsellable. I have been corresponding with them on this matter since 1993 and the Minister, as I said, has corresponded with me since the latter part of 1996. They are no further forward, having boldly gone public with an exposé of what had been done to con them into buying a house that everyone knew had a history of flooding. The Minister should seriously consider the amendments, which might help to prevent such diversionary work from taking place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have two other cases relating to the Thistle avenue area of Grangemouth. Everyone recognised that the burn running down from east Stirlingshire—from
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
what is known as the Braes area—would eventually flow into the River Forth via various other burns in and around Grangemouth. The regional council at the time—and the county council before it—built a flood drain to take away large amounts of water.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sadly, though, other diversionary works have taken place—sometimes quite rightly—on behalf of residents in the Thistle avenue area. Water is now diverted away into the flood trough, but large amounts now run down from the Braes area from the Slamannan plateau, where I live. A great deal of building is going on and the farmers have done much drainage, but with the diversion of water from Thistle avenue and from other areas into the flood trough, it now overflows. Pumps have been installed but they cannot pump into the Westquarter burn to take it into the River Forth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two particular properties are affected, one owned by an elderly lady in her 80s, who is reluctant to leave it. Last year, her house in Primrose avenue was flooded right up to the top of the first floor. The other property is a mill in Wholeflats road which has also been flooded regularly. The amendments would prevent the diversionary work from being carried out without consideration of its impact on others. The floods that occur are not the same as the massive widescale floodings that are written about in the national press. I am not talking about acres and acres of flooded land comparable to those in the constituency of the hon. Member for North Tayside, who made a good case on behalf of his constituents, so many of whom were affected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am talking about one or two isolated individuals whose lives are an absolute misery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The old lady about whom I am talking has twice been flooded so severely that she has lost everything in her possession and is now unable to get insurance. No one seems to want to do anything about the problem. Diversionary works such as the flood trough at Grangemouth and the bunds to prevent flooding at Thistle avenue have been put in place. I would not want those projects removed if that would cause public flooding, but at key times high rainfall and flood water running off the farm lands and uplands of the Braes area causes people to suffer massively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would appear that the amendments would impose a duty to deal with the knock-on effects of bunds and diversionary works. Local authorities should be given responsibility to effect changes in watercourses to protect large, built-up areas, but they must also alleviate the effects of such work on individuals, either through compensation or through undertaking additional diversionary works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a matter for the Government. According to one table of figures, my council area of Falkirk is to be given a mythical £90,000 to deal with problems of flooding. I can assure the Minister that it cost a lot more than £90,000 to deal with the problems caused in one incident, when the lower half of Westquarter village was flooded by the Westquarter burn. It is a
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
nonsense to pretend that any extra or new money is available. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leith often says, the Government are up to a sleight of hand, not providing new funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any case, the sum of £90,000 is derisory: how much would it cost to convince the old lady in Grangemouth to move into other accommodation, and to compensate her for the loss of her home? She should not suffer the consequences of diversionary works put in place to prevent constant flooding of large parts of Grangemouth. The Minister appears to want to kick the ball into the councils' court, but councils will not be given enough money to deal with even the small problems that may arise, such as those that were encountered in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the Bill does not give clear direction about what should happen when diversionary works to protect one person's property cause knock-on effects on other properties. The Minister said that such problems were for councils to solve. I say that they are for the Government: unless the Bill is amended, strengthened and properly financed it will be of no use in dealing even with the small amount of flooding that occurs in my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have tabled three of the amendments in this group, but amendment No. 23 is consequential so I shall confine my remarks to amendment No. 234 and new clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 24 is covered by Government amendment No. 13—one of the rare occasions when the Minister and I say the same thing, albeit in slightly different language. As drafted, the Bill would transfer all responsibility to maintain watercourses to councils and away from riparian owners. That was a serious problem, but the amendments—both mine and the Government's—would mean that flood problems should be dealt with by the sole owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also support amendment No. 2, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. Some local authorities have said that they would prefer the word "may" rather than "shall" to be used in proposed new section 4C(2), on the grounds that it may not always be worth their while to recover small amounts through the small claims court. However, that is a minor matter and I support the substance of the amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New clause 2 deals with emergency powers of entry and raises an important matter. Section 8 of the Flood Prevention Act 1961 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Admission to any land shall not be demanded as of right"</p></blockquote>
by councils
	<br><blockquote><p>"unless fourteen days notice of intended entry has been given to the occupier of the land."</p></blockquote>
If, however, application is made to the sheriff and he is satisfied that there is a case of urgency, he may warrant the council to enter on the land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill places a new duty to act to clear watercourses if that
	<br><blockquote><p>"would substantially reduce the likelihood of … flooding".</p></blockquote>
Blockages, particularly of culverts, can occur quickly as a result of natural debris or irresponsible dumping in watercourses. There can be no guarantee that a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
regular maintenance programme would necessarily pick up those hazards prior to any storm or flash flood. There have been occasions when blocked culverts have quickly caused significant flooding of property. Therefore, if councils are to carry out their duties effectively, it is essential that they can access blockages in an emergency before floods rise to dangerous levels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are further amendments, one in the name of the Minister and one in my name, urging the inclusion in the measure of justices of the peace in addition to sheriffs, but in some circumstances even their actions may be too slow to prevent flooding. For example, in Paisley during the December 1994 floods, Tercet, which is a light engineering company making high-quality products for the electronics industry, was badly flooded. The flooding arose from a blocked culvert on an adjoining vacant site, which was in the ownership of a private development company, the whereabouts of which were not known at that time. Ownership had changed hands and was, in fact, initially denied. The flooding rose to a depth of 0.5 metres within two hours and the company was closed for approximately six weeks, with damage of £1.5 million to repair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While it is not normal to allow emergency access without warrant, the speed and gravity of the consequences of flooding make this an exceptional case. The amendment would allow emergency access without warrant only if, in the view of the responsible officers, waiting for a warrant would result in significant flooding of property. In the circumstances, that would be reasonable and necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It should be noted that in paragraph 18 of the original consultation paper, the Government suggested that
	<br><blockquote><p>"Authorities would be able to carry out work at their own expense with similar access arrangements as obtained in the 1961 Act with the addition of a power to act in an emergency without service of notice."</p></blockquote>
Without the emergency access power there would be a risk of unnecessary flooding continuing to occur in certain areas, and I hope, therefore, that the Government will accept new clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make a brief contribution. I put my name to the amendments in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden. Riparian owners have a responsibility in this case. Some of them neglect their communal responsibility to others who may be affected by their carelessness or negligence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister a couple of questions concerning the clause, the amendments in the name of the Minister and those in the name of my hon. Friend and myself. I was interested in the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk, East (Mr. Connarty). We suffer similar problems with water running off the hills into the burns that run through Gourock, Greenock and Port Glasgow. After a heavy downpour, they cannot cope with the excess flow. That leads to flooding in Greenock and Port Glasgow, not to the severe extent suffered by some people in Glasgow or Bearsden, but it is nevertheless more than a mild inconvenience. There are serious traffic hazards
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
in Port Glasgow after heavy rainfall. There are problems in areas such as mine, not so much with riparian owners, but with those who own properties, estates and farms uphill above our towns. Those problems need to be addressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the clause and the amendments allow councils such as Inverclyde to take action against those upland owners who, because of their negligence or agricultural or forestry activities, cause so much inconvenience and distress to many people living in Greenock and Port Glasgow? Forgive my parochialism, Mrs. Winterton. I believe that this is a general problem where towns are perched on the sides of hills. A number of constituents come to my surgeries to complain about the problems caused by excessive water running through the streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the Minister's view on those home owners who have underground culverts running through their gardens below their houses? Will they be able to act under the clause against persons who they and their legal advisers believe have not conducted their affairs reasonably?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock and Loudoun)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, will be brief. The amendment, which I most certainly support, brings us to the crux of the matter and part of the problem which caused some of the flood damage in my constituency. Riparian owners along the watercourse build bunds to protect their properties and do not give a damn what happens to the water. If it is pushed off their properties and goes downstream, it will find another course—and other victims, who have had nothing to do with the building of the bunds nor, indeed, in some cases, their removal. Those people have no recourse—councils wash their hands of negligence claims thoughout the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was kind enough to visit another area where we saw people who had been flooded for the second time. Their houses had just been repaired only to be under three feet of water again. The main cause of that, apart from the fact that no work had been carried out on the river for several years by Strathclyde regional council, was that planning permission had been given for a housing development to be built at the end of the street on what was known locally as the flooding field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people who were building the houses knew that they would have difficulty in selling in an area known by such a name. They took the precaution of lifting the field five metres, so that when the river burst its banks and the water moved towards the flooding field it was repelled up the street. The flooding, which usually occurred in the field to a depth of two to three feet, was in the back and front gardens—indeed, in the interiors—of the houses along the street. At a stroke, the price of the properties was reduced. At the same time, havoc and misery was created for people who should not have had to suffer, but there was a lack of consideration by the local authority in giving planning permission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I give credit to my local authority, East Ayrshire council. It has already carried out an extensive survey of the areas which are likely to be flooded and has a plan, which will take up to three years to complete, to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
prevent future flooding. However, local authorities must be given, after consultation, the power to stop any movement or building of bunds thoughout the watercourse in their areas or in those adjoining.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effect of the planning permission in the area to which I have referred was the uplifting of a field by five metres and the creation of havoc in other areas. The responsibility for that goes back to those who gave the planning permission. Therefore, the authorities might be liable to litigation. The people in the area of flooding knew that there would be difficulties because of the lifting of the field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The responsibility cannot simply land with riparian owners. The authorities must have the powers to deal with the activities of riparian owners and others, and should bear the responsibility if they are found to be guilty of allowing planning permission without considering what flood action might occur because of developments that they have allowed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful short debate. I shall deal first with some of the points that were raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Falkirk, East talked about flooding in general and mentioned the specific case of his constitutents Mr. and Mrs. Blackstock, if I remember correctly—I am not referring to notes. As a result of the Bill, councils will now have a duty, rather than merely a power, to carry out maintenance work. Councils have existing powers to prevent flooding from agricultural land and I understand that the council is investigating that very point with regard to the case of Mr. and Mrs. Blackstock. I hope that action is being taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith referred to flooding in Paisley in 1994. This is perhaps an opportune moment to say that I will today be announcing a further payment of nearly £160,000 in special financial assistance under the Bellwin scheme to Renfrewshire council. The payment relates to costs that were incurred during the Paisley flooding in December 1994 as a result of the cleaning and clearing of houses and of making temporary accommodation habitable for decanted families.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow mentioned home owners with culverts. Home owners can take action for neglect, and the Bill does not change the law in that respect. It is about new duties for councils and does not change the law concerning actions between neighbouring proprietors. The hon. Gentleman also mentioned drainage from upstream landowners. That is outwith the scope of the Bill, but we plan to consider consultation on river catchment area issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun referred to planning. In September, we issued new planning guidance, NPPG7, which advised councils of the need to take flood risk into account in the location of new developments. I hope that they have done that, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
I intend to address all the issues that have been raised in this group of amendments, some of which are simply of a drafting nature. The substantive issues are in amendment No. 2, new clause 2 and government amendments Nos. 13 and 14. I shall be as brief as I can.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the motivation behind the proposal in amendment No. 2 to compel riparian owners to act to prevent flooding in built-up areas. I am aware of the situation in the area of the hon, Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and that flooding on the River Kelvin could well affect a large agricultural area before reaching houses in an urban area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office consultation paper that we issued just over a year ago posed the possibility of making it an obligation on riparian owners to maintain watercourses, failing which councils would be given powers to carry out the work and recover the costs. That was just one of a range of options that we suggested for consideration and debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following receipt of all the responses to the exercise, we concluded that the issue would be likely to be contentious and difficult to enforce. Indeed, members of the Committee may find it interesting if I quote from COSLA's response to this particular point. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal that authorities could serve notice on owners to carry out maintenance and to give authorities default powers to carry out the work may be superficially attractive but, in practice, is likely to cause difficulty, especially where owners do not have the resources to pay their costs and charging orders have to be placed to provide for eventual recovery."</p></blockquote>
I should make it clear to the hon. Gentleman and the Committee that the Government do not consider that clause 2, as drafted, would transfer all maintenance responsibilities to councils. We remain of the view that the primary responsibility for protecting property from flooding rests with the owner. What we are trying to achieve—and what we consider that clause 2 does—is to provide for a situation in which councils will be required to act for the common good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We felt that we could not make it an obligation on individual owners to fund maintenance work, the main beneficiaries of which would be not themselves, but the community as a whole. As I have said, COSLA stated in its response that such an approach would cause difficulty. I agree with that. It would be impracticable because private owners are, in general, under no obligation to maintain watercourses or flood defences.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that Clydeport plc could be defined as a riparian owner?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow will be understanding if I say that I suspect that that is a litigation matter about which I cannot provide a direct answer today. However, I am more than happy to write to him about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
The hon. Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow intervened as I was saying that the primary responsibility for protecting property still rests with the owner. As I said, we felt that we could not make it an obligation on individual owners to fund maintenance work. Government amendment No. 13 therefore delineates a set of circumstances in which the duty that is imposed by clause 2 would not apply. The hon. Member for Leith also raised that point during the debate on the principle of the Bill. I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify that landowners will still have a responsibility for the maintenance and repair of their watercourses and surrounding works and apparatuses. As I said, we want to create a situation where the council will have to act for the common good but will not have to take over the responsibility for that maintenance or repair work which would benefit only those who were legally entitled to do such work themselves. Amendment No. 13 achieves that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second part of amendment No. 2 would compel riparian owners to seek planning permission before carrying out any works to prevent the flooding of their land. That would be unnecessarily restrictive and, in the light of what the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden has said today about the position in his area—he also referred to it at the Scottish Grand Committee—it would be unwelcome. The hon. Gentleman talked about the danger of the River Kelvin flooding agricultural land before reaching houses in an urban area. Given that the amendment would prevent landowners from carrying out any works, which includes repair and maintenance, without seeking planning permission, it would increase the risk that such work would not be done and consequently increase the danger of flooding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under current policy, various types of development qualify for what are known as permitted development rights. That means that certain types of development are allowed without express planning permission, including the carrying out of works that are required in connection with the improvement or maintenance of watercourse or land drainage works. That is not to say that drainage work is uncontrolled. In areas with an identified flood risk, it remains open to councils to make a direction under article 4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1996 to bring drainage schemes within planning control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 4 directions are subject to the approval of the Secretary of State and he expects councils to oppose such directions only if SEPA is in support. I have not heard any compelling arguments for changing that policy. Indeed, it could reasonably be argued that to do so would make flooding more likely, as I said. I am sure that that is not what the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden intended.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly not going to comment on that, Mrs. Winterton. It is a matter of opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Government amendment No. 14 we want to make it a requirement for councils to notify other councils when they consider it likely, from information available to them, that flooding will occur in other councils' areas. Councils will be exempt from that requirement when it appears to them that the other council is already aware of the position. That provision arose from our consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to say a few words on new clause 2. I can understand the principle behind the proposal of the hon. Member for Leith. We, too, want to allow for quicker access to land but we do not consider that access without a warrant is necessary or appropriate. We will consider Government amendment No. 1 7 later today. As the hon. Gentleman said, it provides for a justice of the peace to sign warrants for access. The Government consider that appropriate and sufficient in the circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for showing his characteristic courtesy to me. What measures could be taken under this clause if Clydeport plc, for example, gave up its dredging operations, thereby causing flooding and serious problems for the riverbank?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That question is supplementary to the point raised by the hon. Gentleman earlier. Rather than offer an answer that may not be what he seeks, I should prefer to consider the matter properly and at some length. With his permission, therefore, I shall write to him about that matter and about the point that he raised earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given those remarks, I hope that Opposition Members will withdraw their amendments and new clause 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I feel that the Minister has treated the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden too lightly, and that he has ignored the point made by hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is well known in Scotland that for a long time planning permissions have been granted that have not allowed the water and drainage authorities, or those charged under previous legislation with preventing floods, to avert the consequences of flooding caused when vast areas of trees on hillsides are felled and replaced by houses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give the Minister an example from the attractive spa town of Bridge of Allan in Stirling district. That is not in my constituency but I know the case in detail. For many years, people—including former Rangers football players—have wanted to live in or build large houses in the upper part of the town, which is known as Mine Woods. Only a small part of that wood remains. When there are heavy rains, the water is supposed to run down the road drains and then flow into Allan water. However, when Allan water is in high spate, the rainwater in fact emerges in nearby Fountain road and floods houses to a depth of two or three feet.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun spoke about raising land to be used for house building, thereby putting the water in another area. However, the problem that arises all over Scotland is well illustrated by the difficulties that have been encountered in Bridge of Allan. When trees are replaced by houses and roads, water is not soaked up and is forced to emerge in the road. When there is a heavy spate and high water in the burns or rivers that are supposed to take up the rain water, that water causes floods in houses. Often the innocent people who suffer have lived through the building of the new houses on the hill nearby.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is what happened in Grangemouth, where the burns join together in Westquarter burn and other burns and then flow into the River Forth. A lot of money was spent by the regional and district councils in Bridge of Allan when I was leader of the council there. The aim was to try to raise the banks, but the fundamental problem is that a planning authority is under no proper duty to take account of the long-term problem caused by excess water flooding a watercourse somewhere else. The Minister has not dealt with that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nor does the Minister appear to take seriously the problems caused by farmers and agricultural landowners who do not worry about the long-term consequences of land drainage. The diversions that they put in have an eventual impact both on new housing and on housing already in situ. If such drainage is not done properly, the water usually passes through those houses.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I point out to my hon. Friend that in some cases tenant farmers fully accept their responsibilities but often have difficulties persuading the estates' owners to take effective measures?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Connarty</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I readily accept that good point. The owners of the land are unlikely to be local farmers. For example, the owners of the Mine Woods in the upper parts of Bridge of Allan are large estate owners who own most of the county of Stirling. Many of the areas that I represent are owned by the Duke of Hamilton—I do not know whether he is a distant relative of the Minister of State. Property is held in the ownership of very large estates. When planning permission is granted to someone who has made an application, the person who makes the money from the sale of the land tends to be a large landowner. Nothing in the Bill or in any of the Government's other proposals deals with the problem of who makes the profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun—if an error has been made or lack of foresight shown by councils, some responsibility should fall on them. However, those who make the profits when agricultural land or forested areas are used to build houses should bear some of the responsibility for making up for the losses when people's homes get flooded. When planning permission is granted, the consequences never seem to
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
fall on those who make a profit from it. Part of the responsibility falls to the council—though it is not laid on them properly in the Bill—but part of the responsibility should fall on those who make the profit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As so often, it is the poor individual householder or ordinary members of the public—as in the cases mentioned by my hon. Friends the Members for Paisley, North (Mrs. Adams) and for Kilmarnock and Loudon—who suffer as a result of bad planning permission. Despoliation of forested or agricultural areas is the result of people seeking a quick profit in house building.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, his amendment No. 13 deals with the first part of my amendment No. 2, and I am grateful to him for his amendment. However, his response is not adequate to proposed section 4C(2) of my amendment. I was not entirely clear about what he said. Is it the case that a riparian owner need not maintain the watercourse within his land and that if it subsequently floods and reaches an urban area, it will still not affect his position? It would be unacceptable if the only way in which a local authority could deal with that situation would be to go in and clear the watercourse without any recourse to financial compensation from the riparian owner. That must be changed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand how difficult it is to secure moneys. Local authorities are always chasing others for works carried out and often face financial problems. However, a riparian owner cannot be allowed to neglect the watercourse, with the result that flooding occurs, which adversely affects others. It cannot be right in that situation for there to be no recourse to the courts when the local authority has the duty to maintain the watercourse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a particular problem with the Land Drainage (Scotland) Acts in relation to the Kelvin. We shall deal with that later, but it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the current position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister also failed to deal with proposed section 4D of my amendment. He spoke about various powers and responsibility for land drainage, but I am not referring to land drainage when I talk about seeking planning permission. When he mentioned a bund in a watercourse that is broken in one area he said that planning permission should be required to fill it in, but that it is not required at the moment. That is correct and applies to the Kelvin. I am sure that we could improve the drafting by using a term such as "new" to cover the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main problem bears repeating. A small burn drains past an urban area with houses on one side and agricultural land on the other. It drains down to the Kelvin. The riparian owner has built a very small bund down one side. As a result, when the water level rises, water floods into the houses. The bund was placed there without planning permission. Once, when there was flooding, we threatened to knock it down and threats of legal action against us were made. The next time there was flooding, the chief executive had it pulled down and alleviated the flooding, and so far nothing has happened.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0287">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
There is a major problem with such bunds. They are not big developments or major drainage prevention schemes. They stretch for no more than 200–300 yards and are no more than 2 metres high, yet they cause great devastation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister clarify those issues? I would be grateful if he could at least consider them, particularly proposed section 4D in amendment No. 2.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Falkirk, East mentioned a number of issues. He referred to planning, which was also mentioned by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun. I fully accept that in the past one could argue that in some cases authorities did not pay enough attention to planning risk. That is why in the on-going process of planning reviews we instituted NPPG 7, recognising that fact and ensuring that in future local authority planning departments would take adequate cognisance of planning risk. That has been recognised and addressed in the light of experience.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Catchment management is dealt with in the next group of amendments, so I will defer making comments on that until we come to that group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden raised matters relating to his area in particular. I understood his points and will consider them, but we have drafted the Bill, tabled amendments and done everything that we can to deal with the situation he mentioned. He referred to the issue of whether there was an obligation on proprietors to maintain watercourses. Under existing law there is no obligation, but clearly it is in the interests of proprietors to do so. By tabling the amendments, we are dealing with the points that concern him and, with the planning points that I mentioned earlier, trying to ensure that there is speedy action to minimise the chance of flooding in his area in future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's position on the second part of amendment No. 2. However, I am still concerned about the third part because he has not dealt with that.

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments reflect the many concerns expressed by hon. Members on Second Reading and by outside organisations that the Bill fails to adopt a catchment area approach or to deal with the wider ecological implications of flood prevention work. There are various ways to tackle the problem, and flood appraisal groups, which are now being set up, are one example of a more holistic approach. It is, however, important to get environmental organisations on board, which is why the amendments propose a role for SEPA and Scottish Natural Heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of SEPA's functions, which are set out in sections 24 and 25 of the Environment Act 1995, already relate to the issue. Section 24 says that those carrying out drainage work should consult SEPA.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Drainage work is broadly defined in section 24(3). Section 25 says that SEPA has a role in assessing flood risk, which is perhaps more relevant to clause 1, so I shall not deal with those aspects of section 25. Section 24 sets down consultation duties; and the amendments build on existing requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
SEPA has raised concerns about the issue, and amendment No. 25 builds on them. It asks that SEPA be consulted before work is done on watercourses. In its submission, SEPA says:
	<br><blockquote><p>The powers given to local authorities under Section 2(1)(a) of the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 are expanded under Section 3 of the same Act and allow various activities both within and on the banks of a watercourse (removal and deposit of mud, gravel, bush and timber) which might lead to serious pollution of a watercourse or damage to conservation, or other wider, interests both within the watercourse and on associated land. We are particularly concerned, for example, about increased aquatic and riverbank herbicide spraying.</p></blockquote>
It goes on to say that it supports statutory consultation on such matters. Riverbanks are an important conservation area, although I am no expert in such matters and would have to consult with SEPA. To take one example of a possible problem, however, the dredging of sediment could create a suspended solid load, which might be deposited on vegetation. If the load was polluted, it would cause additional problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking only about de minimis action on watercourses, but the principle remains that SEPA and SNA should be consulted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New Clause 3 also takes up a point that was made in SEPA's submission, which stated:
	<br><blockquote><p>It would be appropriate for SEPA and SNH jointly to develop and make available guidance on best management practice relating to any works within and alongside watercourses.</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden will build on that point in regard to clause 3, which discusses management plans. It is even more important that such plans are subject to consultation with SEPA and SNH.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point is that any proposals from an individual authority will have knock-on effects on other authorities and on the wider ecology. There must be mechanisms to bring about a more holistic approach. There are various ways of introducing that strategic overview, but the proposals in the amendment to give a role to SEPA and SNH is one satisfactory way of dealing with the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief. The amendments and the new clause make good sense. I have every confidence in the local elected representatives in Inverclyde and their officials. However, I suspect that in matters of this sort—the maintenance of watercourses to prevent flooding—they are not expert. I am sure that they will forgive me for saying that in this illustrious place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Being parochial again, flooding has been a major irritant for many decades on the lower Clyde. Indeed, even the local football ground—the illustrious Cappielow where Greenock Morton has played for
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
many years, starting, I think, in 1874—has been affected. My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. McLeish) recalled that when he was a professional player he shared a belief common to all Scottish footballers that it was the worst ground in Scotland to play on because of its heaviness. That heaviness was caused by the periodic flooding which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden knows, was dealt with by raising the pitch by 3 or 3·5 ft.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The floods have been a problem, but they are usually a minor irritant. However, on occasion they are bad enough to cause serious traffic hazards. A small council such as Inverclyde should not be expected to carry out assessments competently and efficiently without being given guidelines and advice from the Scottish Office or, as new clause 3 provides, from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we have been here before. The right hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and I discussed many of those issues at length during the passage of the Environment Act 1995 which set up SEPA. There is no need to go into them again at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have received numerous representations from environmental groups, and I am grateful to them. The matter could easily be dealt with by amendments to clause 3 for the simple reason that it deals with plans for trying to alleviate flooding. However, it would be more appropriate to have dealt with the consultation—SEPA and SNH would be involved at that stage—before those plans became a reality and before considering the reports and entering into the formal planning procedures. That would be quicker and more effective and the best way to encapsulate our concerns for the environment and the land drainage areas, which are the statutory responsibilities of either SEPA or SNH. They could give their best advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can well understand the thinking behind amendment No. 25, which was spoken to by the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Chisholm) and, indeed, behind amendment No. 3, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and for Greenock and Port Glasgow. The Committee may be aware that it is already a requirement for sites of special scientific interest that landowners must consult SNH if they intend to undertake drainage or other works listed as potentially damaging operations which might affect the special scientific interest within the SSSI. Thus, the Government have already sought to ensure that important environmental areas are not compromised by such work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I would not want to give the impression, however, that the Government are not interested in reviewing from time to time whether new developments are reflected in existing policies and objectives. In that regard, we should like to look again at the regulations that cover the protection of sites of special scientific interest and other areas designated for their natural heritage importance. With agreement, we shall do that outwith consideration of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Following the publication last year of the communication on European Community water policy, we expect the Commission to publish soon a proposal for a water resources framework directive. The communication indicated that consideration should be given to adopting catchment management practices within river basins. It would be premature to anticipate the content of the framework directive but, in this context, we plan to consider the implications for flood prevention activities, including the whole question of consultation between interested parties. I hope that members of the Committee accept that we are prepared to keep the matter under review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Committee members may also be interested to know that the Scottish Office plans to commission research in the non too distant future to study what has been done in relation to catchment planning in Scotland and elsewhere. These things require time. In the meantime, there is the continuing possibility of voluntary arrangements and I feel confident that councils, along with SEPA and Scottish National Heritage, will approach these matters in a spirit of cooperation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
[MR. JOHN MAXTON 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Members for Leith, for Strathkelvin and Bearsden and for Greenock and Port Glasgow for tabling the proposals. I hope that they accept that I do not oppose the principle of effective, wider communication on this subject, but in the context of the on-going discussions on this and other related matters, it would be premature to act at this stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to new clause 3, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Leith. Although I understand the motive behind it, I am afraid that I cannot accept that such a duty should be imposed on SEPA. The way in which maintenance work should be undertaken is a matter for council themselves. That has been the case since the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961 came into force and we believe that that is how it should remain. What will change, of course, is that the power to maintain watercourses will become a duty. SEPA has no responsibility for, or specialised knowledge of, watercourse maintenance. Its role is distinct: it deals with pollution matters and advice on flooding risk. We would not want to impose a further duty on it at this time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith referred to section 24 of the Environment Act 1995. I acknowledge that it requires any person carrying out drainage work to consult SEPA about the precautions to be taken to prevent pollution of controlled waters as a result of such work. That section, however, is still to commence, and before it is implemented, full consultation on its extent will take place. At the moment, the Government consider it inappropriate to place a duty on SEPA to produce guidelines on the maintenance of watercourses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, with an assurance that the Government are prepared to consider the principle of amendments Nos. 25 and 3 in future legislation, I ask the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I welcome the fact that the Minister has generally taken on board our points, we would prefer to have something more specific in the Bill.

	<div class='title'>DUTY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO PUBLISH REPORTS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 26, in page 2, line 5, leave out "six" and insert "twelve".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple amendment which would change six months to a year. As with many pieces of legislation, it is better to do something properly rather than quickly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first report will be particularly important and will be more difficult for councils than future reports—that stands to reason. If reports are to be properly researched and if the community is to be involved in the consultation process prior to publication, it may be that some councils will require more than six months. Many will be ready in six months, but large rural councils such as Highland council may need more than six months to do the job properly. That is why this amendment to clause 3 is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A fundamental question in connection with the clause concerns how much will have to be taken on board by the reports. I asked that question on Second Reading. The key words in clause 3 relate to local authorities specifying the measures that they
	<br><blockquote><p>"consider that they require to take".</p></blockquote>
I hope that the Minister will make it clear that councils will have some discretion and that they will have to make reports only on actions that they consider to be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is meant by the word "specify" in the context of the clause? As was the case in relation to the word "survey" in clause 1, there is a fear that detailed technical studies may be implied. Clearly, the length of time required will depend on the amount of detail in the plans, and on how large an area is to be covered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, clause 3 has its own funding problems. The Committee has discussed the £3 million incurred as a result of clauses 1 and 2, but the plans in clause 3 involve major capital works and so will require even larger sums of money. The objection has been made that plans for six months or a year do not amount to much when there is no money to implement them. There is £15 million of challenge funding money available for next year, but applications for many times that amount have already been made. Those applications cover not only flood work but many other types of capital work. I hope that the Minister will consider that problem.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment would extend the period of time within which councils must prepare and publish initial reports specifying the measures that councils consider necessary to prevent or mitigate the flooding of non-agricultural land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith mentioned the words "specify" and "consider". The meaning of the word "consider" is clear: it is up to councils to decide what they consider they require, and how they specify that depends on that decision. The hon. Gentleman made slightly heavy weather of the words used in the Bill. I expect responsible councils—and most are responsible—to have much of the information already to hand or to have sought to secure it. In any event, it should not take a great deal of work to compile the initial reports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government consider it important that we do not have to go through another winter before initial reports are prepared. Amendment No. 26 would result in an unacceptable delay that would not be good for anyone. I hope that the hon. Member for Leith will withdraw the amendment, given that councils should have most of the work under way already.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was looking in the clause for the word "initial", but to no avail. However, I do not want to be accused of quibbling again.

Some of the fears felt by councils would be allayed if they were given guidance about the level of detail required, but the principle remains that it is better for the plans to be done properly rather than quickly. However, if the Minister undertakes to give guidelines on the amount of detail required, I shall not press the matter.

	<i>Increase in certain fines.</i></p>
</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Chisholm</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Once again, the Minister and I are in agreement, at least about two of the changes to proposed fines. I want to press amendment No. 27 because that is where there is a difference between the Government's position and mine. I accept the Minister's proposed changes to the fine levels for wilful obstruction and false information, but there is still a problem in relation to dumping. The maximum fine under byelaws for dumping remains the same—£1,000. Amendment No. 27 proposes that that should be increased to £2,500. If the other maximum fines are being inceased, why should not that fine also be increased, especially as dumping is becoming far more common and, therefore, a more serious problem than wilful obstruction or giving false information?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change would help to get across to members of the public the message that they have a role and a duty to assist in the prevention of flooding. It would also get across to the judiciary the message that Parliament takes the matter seriously. Flood prevention is the responsibility of all who can play a part. Councils are being given additional duties and it is important that we should make it clear that members of the public also have a responsibility. I do not need to elaborate on the serious consequences that could arise from dumping in or near rivers. It is appropriate that the maximum available fine should be increased from £1,000 to £2,500, as amendment No. 27 seeks to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise, Mr. Maxton, for rising so slowly. I looked around because I thought that my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Gallie) was on his feet, but he was not. He is remarkably quiet today. I know that he sees the Bill as non-controversial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Leith said that he was surprised to find himself in agreement with me on these issues, but the Bill is non-controversial. As I said on Second Reading, we have tried to improve matters and to prevent future suffering because of flooding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am fully aware that there is support for an increase in the level of fines for contravening byelaws made to prevent the obstruction of any watercourse and the dumping of rubbish in watercourses. In some circumstances councils will as a result of the Bill have to remove any rubbish that is dumped in watercourses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While any obstruction or dumping is a serious matter, as it could increase the risk of flooding or worsen the consequences of a flood, the level of fine has already been substantially increased since the time of the original Act. I am not convinced that the changes in the Bill warrant a further increase in the level of fine. I believe the present level 3 fine is adequate.

	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Following representations received, the Government decided to table amendment No. 17, which would provide for quicker access to land in an emergency. During her speech at the Scottish Grand Committee, the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) also referred to the problems councils can have when trying to access land. It is fair to say that the amendment does not go as far as some councils had hoped, in as much as we are not proposing to provide the power of access without a warrant. We do not consider that the circumstances merit such a wide-ranging power. We do, however, agree that there is scope for enhancing the councils' ability to act quickly when the need arises. By extending the authority to sign warrants to justices of the peace as well as sheriffs, we believe that the process of obtaining a warrant for access will be made easier and speedier. Consequential on that are amendments Nos. 15 and 16, which are purely of a drafting nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment No. 28, the Government's amendment No. 17 did indeed extend the authority to sign warrants to justices of the peace, as the hon. Member for Leith suggested.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government new Clause 1, which the Committee will consider shortly, will also seek substantially to increase the level of fines. As the hon. Gentleman and I are obviously thinking along the same lines, that amendment is now not required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendments Nos. 29 and 30 suggest making a small change to the existing Act by altering clause 9(1) to clause 9 subsection (1). These are consequential to amendment No. 31 proposed by the hon. Member for Leith which will be covered by the Government's new clause. The hon. Gentleman's intentions will be addressed by the new clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 31 seeks to increase the level of fines for contravening the Act. As already mentioned, I am in favour of increasing the level of fines in some instances and would like to deal with that next in the context of the Government's new clause 1.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are tabling new clause 1 following representations received. Action was sought to upgrade the seriousness with which breaches of the 1961 Act were treated. The hon. Member for Leith referred also to the need for stiffer penalties in his speech at the Scottish Grand Committee on 13 January.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are happy to make it clear in the Bill how serious we consider any breaches of the provisions of the 1961 Act. The maximum penalty for any offence will now be level 3 on the standard scale—presently £1,000—compared with £5 and £20, depending on the circumstances, when the 1961 Act was put on the statute book.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already referred to dumping, for which fines were uprated to level 3 in 1983. We consider that an appropriate level of fine for the gravity of such offences. With those comments, I ask the hon. Gentleman to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Clearly, I regret the fact that the Government have not taken on board the proposal to increase the maximum fine for dumping, which is the most serious of the three offences that relate to flooding. It is regrettable that it is once again left to the Opposition to be tough on antisocial behaviour.

	<div class='member'>Sir Hector Monro</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have moved amendment No. 4 so that we can debate an important subject, which affects my constituency and that of the President of the Board of Trade, my right hon. Friend the Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Lang). The subject raised in the amendment is important for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
Members of Parliament throughout Scotland, whose constituencies are affected by rivers such as the Clyde, the Devon, the Dean and the Kelvin. The amendments are important and, given the selection before us, I am sure that we shall reach a satisfactory compromise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 4 begins to remove the Annan and the Nith from clause 5. Government amendment No. 18 rights a wrong, but that right is then repealed in Government amendment No. 19. My other amendments all tend to leave out the Annan and the Nith and, later on, to postpone the introduction of clause 5 and to exclude it from the schedule. I am sure that everything will be covered in our debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been overwhelming opposition to new clause 5 in my constituency. I have received more than 100 letters and there has been substantial comment in the newspapers, including editorials.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I briefly explained the position at the Scottish Grand Committee in Edinburgh, although the debate had to be curtailed. In the 1930 Act and particularly the 1941 Act, special assistance was given to owners of agricultural land to bring it into production during the war and to create employment—much river work was done by hand, as we did not have mechanical diggers then. The thirteen schemes were in Scotland. Over the years, they have been of great benefit, costing the Scottish Office about £120,000 per annum and half of that to the constituencies of Dumfries and Galloway and Upper Nithsdale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there is an anomaly, as the schemes give preferential treatment to those areas in the scheme. Even so, more than 200 people are affected. However, under the Bill, that will end in April this year—a little more than a month's time—if a statutory instrument is introduced. That is an impossible timetable for riparian owners and tenant and other farmers to meet. I tabled the amendments because I believed the consultation period to be unfair to them, and that is why they did not have time for preparation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The White Paper last spring did not mention the effect of clause 5. The press release issued on 26 September simply said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In addition, there are proposals to terminate the Secretary of State's responsibility for statutory drainage schemes."</p></blockquote>
Again, that did not give us much time before the draft Bill in November said that the Land Drainage (Scotland) Acts of 1930 and 1941 were to be repealed. So there has been very little time to consult and prepare a defence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second point deals with the concurrent condition of the floodbanks of the river, while the third deals with the responsibilities of the situation if the Acts are repealed. I have mentioned the consultation period. In November and December, the local authority, community councils, the National Farmers Union and the Scottish Landowners Federation began to be extremely critical of the proposals. That is why I opposed clause 5 when it was debated in the Scottish Grand Committee, although otherwise I accepted the Bill as beneficial to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
I have not given my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary notice of this, but I believe that there has been a report—so my constituents tell me—of the condition of the riverbank by one of his officials over the past year or so. Perhaps that could be made available later to the voluntary committee that I propose we set up if we have time. There are substantial repercussions—we are talking about 19.2 miles of the Annan and 12.7 miles of the Nith. It is a large area of the two constituencies, which is why we are so concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been greatly helped by the map that the Scottish Office has provided the Committee. A copied map is not terribly clear to read, but it shows the extent of the two rivers and the amount of ground where there is help with flood prevention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Secretary of State's letter to me of 18 November last year, following my expression of concern to him, he said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"it is our intention to complete the 1996–97 programme of maintenance works on 1930 and 1941 Act drainage schemes to ensure that riparian owners will assume maintenance responsibilities for drainage schemes which are in excellent condition."</p></blockquote>
That is a pretty categorical statement, and we know what categorical statements mean in the press these days. That would mean that at the time of handover, those who were affected by the two rivers would have floodbanks and drainage schemes in first-class order. That is good news. Even so, in a letter that the prospective parliamentary candidate Struan Stevenson sent to the Secretary of State last week, he said that when he had walked schemes 1 and 2 with a large number of riparian owners, they estimated that there could be £200,000 worth of work to be done before the floodbanks and the gravel that needs dredging out and so forth could be considered to be in good condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that, whatever the result of the debate on the amendment, the riverbanks, the flap valves, the culverts and the gravel will all be cleared in first-class condition before the Scottish Office gives up its responsibility. I want an assurance from my hon. Friend the Minister about that. In the light of constructive discussions that I have had with him and with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I am sure that that will be the case and that it will apply to other Scottish rivers too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential for the long-term benefit of the communities affected that voluntary organisations are in place to take over the responsibilities of the Secretary of State. That cannot be done overnight. We need time—two or three years, if possible—to clear the way, bring in schemes and develop proper river management for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased with the Minister's amendment, which offers some breathing space. It has been a rough period for those living near the Annan over the past two or three years as a result of the development of the M74. The river appears to have been in flood half the time, with much mud and silt coming down from the road
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
works. It has seriously affected fishing and represents a long-term worry over the breeding stocks of salmon, trout and other fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Forestry has also changed over the years. We are now much more subjected to flash floods which come up and go down quickly rather than the more gradual increases that were more common many years ago. As I said, it has been a rough time, so we should not impose additional problems on riparian owners who are doing their best to re-establish the Annan as a first-class river for fishing, as it has been for many years. Relative to forestry, it applies to the same extent to the River Nith. Severe flooding from the Nith is almost an annual event in the Whitesands in the town of Dumfries. It can be particularly severe there at high water, since it lies in the tidal area of the Nith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made many points and I know that the Minister has listened to me personally in his own room, as has the Secretary of State in his. I hope that I have brought him to accept that passing the Bill as it stands today would have placed an impossible handicap on those two rivers and indeed on other Scottish rivers. The requisite consultation to make such a massive change has not been taken. More time is required to set up alternatives and to bring the rivers into first-class order, as promised by the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall gladly listen to the debate if other hon. Members want to speak about their own particular areas. We can then decided the best way to proceed regarding the various constructive amendments on the amendment paper. I am sure that we can come to a satisfactory conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Galbraith</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessary to say much more following the right hon. Member for Dumfries who has explained the issues behind the amendments quite well. The Minister has gone a long way to respond to our requests, for which I am grateful. As he will appreciate, there is currently a statutory duty to maintain these waterways and its rests with the Secretary of State. When that changes, there will no longer be a statutory duty to maintain them over agricultural lands. As was said when we were discussing amendment No. 2, it will be up to the riparian owners to deal with the matter, but if they do not do so there is little we can do, as the Minister explained. He should consider the regulations in the light of his comments on the second part of amendment No. 2. The statutory duty which maintains the River Kelvin in my area and keeps it well drained is being lost—responsibility is being handed back to the riparian owners who have no statutory duties in the matter and whose actions can result in extensive flooding beyond their own lands, which can cause great expense to others. Unless we can implement a system which guarantees us the powers and obligations that we have at the moment, the current flooding legislation will have been demeaned and watered down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I am grateful that you, Mr. Maxton, have selected Government amendment No. 32. It is uncontroversial and will, I hope, be seen as a
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
gesture of reassurance to my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, who have expressed concerns about the clause. I have tried to take on board the concerns that they discussed on Second Reading and thereafter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my right hon. Friend and to the hon. Gentleman for tabling amendments which reflect the concerns about the clause. I gave an assurance that we would consider their comments carefully, particularly their representations that the statutory drainage schemes created under the Land Drainage (Scotland) Acts 1930 and 1941 should be extended to give beneficiaries more time to prepare for the assumption of maintenance responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend suggested that there had not been consultation on the subject. However, we consulted and clause 5 produced only 12 or so objections out of, I think, 300 beneficiaries. The response may not have been quite as strong as he suggested, but I sympathise with his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendments Nos. 18, 19, 20 and 32 represent our positive and constructive response to the representations which have been made. They will enable us to put the three schemes created under the 1930 Act back on a firm legal footing immediately, but will also allow us to create a legal framework which will enable us to extend the lifetime of the statutory drainage schemes. We intend to extend the schemes for a further two years, until 1 April 1999, to give beneficiaries time to plan ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Government amendment No. 32 specifies a termination date of 1 April 1999 for the final repeal of the 1930 and 1941 Acts. I hope that the amendments will be welcomed by the Committee and, in particular, by my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the Government amendments to the clause, I hope that my right hon. Friend and the hon. Gentleman will reconsider their amendments. For the record, however, amendment No. 4 would thwart an essential objective—the restoration of full legal authority for maintenance works on the three 1930 Act schemes. If it was accepted we would have no legal authority to continue maintenance works on those schemes, including what is known as the Annan 1 scheme in my right hon. Friend's constituency. I am sure that he would not want that to happen. Subsection (1) of the clause must therefore remain in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 5 would render the Bill hybrid as it would localise what is otherwise a Scottish Bill. Hybrid Bills require different and potentially time-consuming handling arrangements—they go in Committee on the Floor of the House. While I respect my right hon. Friend's concern about protecting the interests of his constituents on the Annan and the Nith, I am sure that a hybrid Bill is not what he had in mind. The Government amendments to the clause will enable us to extend all 13 statutory drainage schemes until 1 April 1999. I hope that my right hon. Friend will therefore accept that our proposals are reasonable for all concerned, including his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
Amendment No. 6 would allow the eventual repeal of the 1941 Act by way of a statutory instrument. Government amendment No. 32 goes a stage further by specifying the termination date of 1 April 1999 in the Bill. I hope that that gives my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries greater reassurance that the Government have given sympathetic consideration to his desire for more time for his constituents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 7 seems to be intended to cancel the proposed repeal of the 1941 Act. The two-year extension to the lifetime of the 13 statutory drainage schemes should be sufficient reassurance for my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries to withdraw his amendment. However, amendment No. 8 would, like amendment No. 5, render the Bill hybrid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 9, tabled by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, would delay the implementation of clause 5 for at least three years. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that our proposal to extend the schemes for two years is a fair and reasonable compromise for his constituents. The Committee must bear it in mind that extending the schemes even by two years will cost around £400,000 when Scottish Office running costs are included. My right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden both acknowledged at the Scottish Grand Committee on 13 January that the schemes could not continue in perpetuity, I hope that the two-year compromise we are offering strikes a reasonable balance between their constituency needs and our policy objective of removing those obsolete pieces of legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 10 is consequential upon the other amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries. In view of our proposals in the Government amendments to clause 5, I hope that my right hon. Friend will reconsider this amendment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and to the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden for tabling these amendments to a clause which clearly gave them difficulties. I can confirm to my right hon. Friend that the comments in the letters sent to him by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State about leaving the schemes in good working order are a commitment. In the light of all that I have said, I hope that the amendments are not pressed further.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister. He was slightly critical of the amendments, but they were drafted with the greatest skill by a person of the highest authority, whose name I shall not mention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I withdraw the amendments, will the Minister go a little further on the point raised by the hon. Member for Strathkelvin and Bearsden? The Scottish Landowners Federation is unhappy about the question of liability. Federation members still feel that, because the Secretary of State took over responsibility for flood banks and river works, that liability cannot just disappear by Act of Parliament. Were a riparian owner to be challenged, almost certainly he would have to bring the Scottish Office into any action
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
brought against him. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would say a little more about the matter of liability, and explain exactly where the Scottish Office stands on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kynoch</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped that the letter written by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to my right hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries on 30 January would have given comfort, as it covered that point fully. However, I shall recap what the letter said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State does not own flood banks: his statutory responsibilities relate to maintenance only. The flood banks are owned by the landowners, and it is important that rebuilding or the replacement that is sometimes necessary after floods are not confused with the initial construction of flood banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legal advisers have examined the issue of liability closely, but there is no doubt that a landowner who impounds water on his land owes a duty of care to those who might be affected by its release. That duty of care is no different for the beneficiaries of the statutory drainage schemes compared to their flood prevention and land drainage counterparts on the Annan and Nith and elsewhere on Scottish rivers where manmade floodbanks exist.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No special factors and circumstances have been identified which would convince us that beneficiaries of the statutory drainage schemes face any new liability that their neighbours outwith the schemes have not faced for many years. We hold to our view that clause 5 does no more than place all riparian owners on the same footing in terms of responsibility for maintaining floodbanks. Indeed, our legal advisers have undertaken a scrutiny of UK case law over the past 50 years and have failed to uncover any reported cases which involve the breach of a floodbank where liability arising from such a breach fell on the shoulders of the owner of the floodbank. I hope that that will give my right hon. Friend the reassurance that he seeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister for that detailed assurance. Now it will be in

I am also extremely grateful to him for the discussions we have had and the conclusions he has reached, in that we will now have two years or more in which to prepare our voluntary scheme and everyone will have time to consider and discuss the matters in detail. I am also glad to know that as far as drainage and flooding are concerned, the floodbanks and the river itself will be left in first-class condition by the Scottish Office. I greatly appreciate what my hon. Friend the Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have done, and I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
