	<i>(Morning)</i></p>

	<p>[MR. HARRY GOURLAY 
	<i>in the Chair</i>]</p>

	<div class='debates'>

	<section>

	<div class='bill'>Education (Scotland) (No. 2) Bill</div> <!-- bill -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. John Maxton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Cathcart)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Only Part I of the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of Tuesday afternoon's proceedings is available. The second part, covering the latter part of our proceedings, is not. It is therefore immensely difficult for members of the Committee to follow what is going on or to be sure what was and was not said. I should be grateful if you could make sure that in future the most up-to-date part of the 
	<i>Official Report</i> is available when the morning sitting begins.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon Gentleman for raising that point of order. The Committee has certainly been placed in some difficulty. I know that the authorities try their best to see that the 
	<i>Official Report</i> is produced timeously, but its absence puts the Chair in a very difficult position this morning, because I was not in the Chair at the end of the last sitting of the Committee, on Tuesday night. Accordingly, I am in some difficulty in deciding whether there should be a debate on clause 4 stand part. As I do not have the evidence before me, I am obliged to have a clause stand part debate, but I hope that the Committee will not take undue advantage of the Chair in that respect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr William Hamilton 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fife, Central)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I understand your difficulties and those of the printers, but we find ourselves in a considerable difficulty. Some of the amendments to clause 4 were more important than others, but the ministerial statements were certainly important, and without a written record of them it will be difficult to follow the Minister's arguments in the clause stand part debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I respectfully draw your attention, Mr. Gourlay, to the fact that clauses 3 and 4 refer specifically to the Warnock report. We had no clause stand part debate on clause 3.1 make no complaint about that— it may have been our own fault—'but it is therefore much more important that the Committee should have a fairly long clause stand part debate on clause 4, which concerns the principles enshrined 'in the Warnock report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can you, Mr. Gourlay, try to find out when the last part of the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of Tuesday afternoon's sitting will be available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been in touch with the 
	<i>Hansard</i> authorities, who are doing their best to make copies available to the Committee as soon as possible. However, we shall have to proceed on the basis—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Martin J. O'Neill 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Do we have to proceed on the basis of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>410</span>
absence of the 
	<i>Official Report!</i> Would it not be in order for us to adjourn until it is available? As you yourself have said, Mr. Gourlay, you do not know what happened on Tuesday night. Undertakings were given by the Minister, but we cannot see exactly what was said. I sat through the whole of the proceedings, as did the Minister, and we would be obliged if we could have the 
	<i>Official Report</i> this morning, before we proceed with the stand part debate. If we cannot have the 
	<i>Official Report,</i> will you consider adjourning the Committee until it is available?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. There are precedents for Committees carrying on in the absence of the 
	<i>Official Report</i> of their previous debates. I am sure, however, that the Government will understand the urgency of the request that has been made and will take the appropriate action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the point raised by the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), I suggest that we proceed with the clause stand part debate. We are not discussing the Warnock report; we are discussing clause 4. Clearly, reference to the report would be in order, but it would not be in order to refer to it at great length, particularly as we have had a fairly extensive debate on various amendments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should have preferred to be able to read the 
	<i>Official Report</i> before I made my judgment on a clause 4 stand part debate. That is why I have appealed to hon Members not to take advantage of the Chair. However, to adjourn the Committee until the 
	<i>Official Report</i> is available is not permissible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='clause'>Clause 4</div> <!-- clause -->

	<section>

	<div class='title'>CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS WITH CERTAIN SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS</div> <!-- title -->

	<p>
	<i>Question proposed,</i> That the clause, as amended, stand part of the Bill.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am opposed to clause 4 standing part of the Bill. I do not intend to go into any great detail about the recommendations in the Warnock report at this stage, but we should consider clause 4 in the context of the report, because, those important recommendations were made after a lengthy examination of the circumstances surrounding young people with special educational needs. The recommendations have been the subject of considerable interest and debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we could have spent more time discussing the report, but perhaps by Report stage the pressure groups will have had an opportunity to consider the Government's justification of their positron on Warnock. I am certain that such groups would like to see changes made to the Bill. Therefore, we shall want to consider this part of the Bill once again on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our basic reason (for not wanting clause 4 to stand part of the Bill is that no financial provisions have been made to back its proposals. Without financial support, the provisions are virtually meaningless, so the Bill is not even necessary. Most of the Warnock recommendations could have been dealt with by
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0233">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>411</span>
administrative circular or by other means. It is simply an attempt by the Government to salve their consciences by putting these proposals in the Bill. The absence of any financial support for this group is evidence of the Government's distorted sense of priorities in respect of the needs of young people, and especially those with special educational needs. The Government should impose a duty on local authorities to provide not only for children of school age, but for younger children. We have discussed at some length various schemes which have been considered in different parts of the world which would be of benefit to certain parts of Scotland. The Minister has made no attempt to deny the benefit of those schemes, but has simply whittered on about there not being enough money or resources, saying that these deserving causes will have to wait until funds become available or until local authorities are allowed to increase their rates to a level which will enable them to finance these activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision for under-fives is sketchy at best, but provision should be greatly expanded for those with special educational needs. The Government have missed a tremendous opportunity to provide for that part of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parents of youngsters with special educational needs require considerable assistance. It need not necessarily be provided through the school or the nursery system. We recognise that this is a concession, but the provision about a named person will not solve overnight the problems of parents of young people with special educational needs—"recorded children", as I suppose they will have to be called. These parents will need more assistance than the Minister's minor concession in accepting the principle of a named person, who would have the responsibility to liaise with the parents and the agencies which can assist the parents and the child. These agencies are now severely constrained by the financial burden of increased VAT.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not see the legislation as even a starting point for improvement in the care of the handicapped and the disabled. At best it is a cruel deception by a Government who are cynically manipulating these children as a justification for their inaction in the International Year of Disabled People. Many of my hon Friends will wish to return to this theme, that in this international year the Government should not impose such low priority on care and assistance for such people. I ask the Minister to tell us in his reply how much will be spent on young people with special educational needs in this International Year of Disabled People. Will it be significantly more in real terms than was spent in 1980? Will more money be available for these young people per head, and in the form of new buildings and new resources, or will they be treated equally with the rest of the community in having to share the burden of Tory economic policies and failures?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One remembers the particularly offensive reply of the Prime Minister some months ago at Question Time. Answering a question from the Opposition Benches, she said that the disabled and handicapped
	<span class='label label-info column'>412</span>
must help themselves, like the rest of us. We consider that that, apart from being offensive, showed a great lack of sympathy for the disabled and handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In fairness, we do not lay at the Minister's door the same lack of sympathy. I should be happy to attack the Under-Secretary with responsibility for education if he were here, but I shall not do so in his absence. When he returns we will have a go at him. The Under-Secretary with responsibility for health and social services has a deserved reputation for being a caring man, but if he cares but is not prepared to do anything practical about it, we are forced to the belief that he, along with the others, is not prepared to stand up and fight in the Government for those who cannot fight for themselves. To talk about sharing the burden across the community is a cynical and hollow approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that the Minister will look again at some of the points that we have made about the manner in which children will be treated. We still have nagging doubts about whether children in special schools will be subject to corporal punishment. We have heard that it does not happen often, but we are not convinced that, until legislation bans corporal punishment in these institutions, corporal punishment may not be inflicted. We regard corporal punishment as inappropriate not only for young people with special educational needs, but for all young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had a debate on whether there should be statements or records. Various views have been expressed, and we know that the Minister is to look through the list of synonyms for "record" and "statement" to see whether he can find a form acceptable to the parliamentary draftsmen and ultimately to the House. I know that he is endeavouring to establish a kind of political thesaurus for expressions about public expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We could probably draw up a political thesaurus this morning of expressions of sympathy which fail to line up to the financial responsibilities that the sympathy would require. But I do not propose that we do that this morning, because I think that there would be a recurrent theme, which lies at the very heart of our opposition to this part of the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Government who can find between £3i million and £5 million for an assisted places scheme for those who are clearly capable of looking after themselves in regard to education, are yet unable to find anything like that amount of extra money for those with special educational needs. One can always spend more money on education. It is a desirable area in which to expand public expenditure. But, when the money spent on education is taxpayers' money, in a compassionate society some of those who may perhaps never be in a position to pay tax should be given privileged consideration and assistance over and above the call of the Government's monetarist philosophy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are groups in our society which require special assistance. If the Government wish to carry through public expenditure cuts, those groups should
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0234">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>413</span>
not only be protected against the cuts, but should be given even more assistance. If the Government want to take a hardfaced, accountants' approach, a bottom-line approach, towards the treatment of the disabled and handicapped, they deserve all the moral criticism and opprobrium which our society can pour upon them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of my hon Friends will wish to take part in the debate. Some Conservative Members may even wish to speak to seek to justify the lack of finance to be spent in this area. I want to give my hon Friends as much opportunity as possible to speak, because the Opposition feel that this is a very important area. As I have said, we shall wish to reexamine on Report some of the areas which we have considered only sketchily in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The needs of the disabled and handicapped, especially those under 5 and those between 16 and 19, are almost completely ignored by this legislation. They are not to be given anything like the priority that they deserve. Through no fault of their own, they require special treatment. If the Government can find money for the assisted places scheme and for expensive defence systems which it has yet to be proved will have any strategic, diplomatic or political effectiveness, at a time when we are in grave danger of creating a nuclear armoury in this country—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman is moving away from the clause. The financial resolution in connection with the Bill is very wide, and therefore the money will be available provided the authorities wish to use it. I shall restrict the argument on the financial aspect in this clause stand part debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay, but our understanding of the financial provisions and of what the Government suggest in that they do not have the money. Without that money many of the provisions in this part of the Bill are virtually meaningless. That is why we do not want the clause to stand part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am trying to respond to the Government's challenge. They have repeatedly told us that they would not be prepared to provide the money, because the public purse could not afford it. At the same time, they have challenged us to suggest alternative sources of finance. I was merely trying to say that there were spheres within the Government's ambit—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I appreciate what the hon Gentleman has said. Perhaps the Chair was at fault in not pulling up the Minister when he issued the challenge. But it is not the Committee's duty to debate where the money will come from. According to the money resolution, money is provided to cover the powers contained in the Bill. Sufficient money may not be provided to cover the amendments which the hon Gentleman suggested—that is, to impose a duty rather than a power. But we are now debating the clause as it stands. Enough argument has taken
	<span class='label label-info column'>414</span>
place on the financial aspect of the various amendments, and it would be repetitive to pursue them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay. I had nearly concluded, and I do not wish to take up any more of the Committee's time. I hope to speak again when the Minister has replied to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that this clause should not stand part, because it contains nothing that requires major legislation. Most of its provisions could have been achieved by administrative circular, and the clause merely serves to build up the hopes of those who are desperate and who will clutch at virtually any straw. Many of those people will be the parents of young people who have special educational needs. We believe that this part of a thoroughly dishonest Bill is perhaps the most offensive of all, because it seeks to make political capital out of a group who are not capable of defending themselves and who look to Governments and Ministers for assistance which is not forthcoming in the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An opportunity has been missed, and large sections of the community will consider that to be most unfortunate. At the time of the next election, that will be one of the least attractive parts of the Government's record. We shall seek to hammer them about it when we are able to overturn the legislation once and for all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to take part in the debate because the clause is, I believe, the most important in the Bill. It deals with a specific problem and is perhaps the only clause that may achieve some immediate educational benefit for the Scottish education system. However, like my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), I have grave reservations about whether the way in which the clause has been tackled and the omissions from it—I accept your ruling on omissions, Mr. Gourlay—will weaken its impact or even make it useless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, Mr. Gourlay, that you will not mind if I refer briefly to the explanatory and financial memorandum, which says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The special educational needs provisions (clauses 3 and 4) will be carried out within existing resources."</p></blockquote>
That is clear. In a sense, the clause attempts to implement chapter 4 of Warnock, and not much more than that. Its essence—the first recommendations of Warnock—is that the first job is to find out which children require special education, or education specific to them because of their special needs. That is what chapter 4 and the clause are about. The Minister said during our debates on the amendments that the general framework had to be set up first, before starting to build on that and going on to the next phase of Warnock—how to do something about the children once they have been recognised, recorded, and properly assessed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to consider whether what the Minister seeks in the clause can be achieved within the existing resources, because that is a very important point. Essentially, the clause seeks to recognise and record those who are in need of some form of special education. I think that that is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0235">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>415</span>
a much wider group than most people generally appreciate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Bill refers to children who have special educational needs, and not to the disabled child or the mentally handicapped child, because it goes much wider than those two groups. One small example of what I mean by that is the child who in the first two or three years of his life—perhaps because of premature birth, an accident or illness— does not develop normally. There is nothing wrong with the child; he is neither physically disabled nor mentally handicapped, but his development has been retarded. In the first years of his life, or even at some point once he has started school, the child may have been in a car accident and left unconscious, or incapable of taking part in education for six months or a year. In terms of his age, that child has special educational needs, because he requires to be taken through the work that he has missed more rapidly than other children, so that he catches up with his peer group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a special educational need, as is that of those whose development has been retarded at an early age because of an illness or something else that has happened to them. Sometimes the cause may be emotional. There are children who, for some reason, have been disturbed at a very early age. They have to be taken through that by psychological means. The retardation of their development is not mental disability in the sense that is normally meant, but the children have to be force fed a little in order to push them through and bring them up to the same level as their peers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When such children start school, or during their first two or three years at school, they can be given more care and attention at a special school, or through remedial education or attendance at special units for some of their educational time. They can be brought up to the same level, so that when they reach, perhaps, the end of the infants' stage of the primary school, at the age of 7 or 8, they are on the same level. They have caught up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those children, too, have special educational needs. It is not only those with physical or mental handicaps who have such needs, but a much wider group. That is why most of us welcome the use in the Warnock report of the term "special educational needs".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must see whether the existing provisions in local education authorities are sufficient to carry out the task that would be set them by the clause. They would first have to identify the children who required this education. Secondly, they would have to assess them across a wide area—it is a matter not just of a medical assessment, but of a psychological and an educational assessment. The assessment must be multi-purpose. Thirdly, they would have to follow that up throughout the children's early years, their school years, and even after school years, to assess the provision made, whether the children had changed and whether they should be taken off the record because their special educational needs had,
	<span class='label label-info column'>416</span>
been met and they were capable of continuing their education normally through the school system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There must be a continuous assessment. So a lengthy process must be gone through. I can speak only from limited experience of this area, but I have grave reservations about whether local education authorities have the abilities to carry out their work under the clause with their existing resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am loath to say this, because it is very personal to me, but I have a child who, although he has not been assessed as mentally defective—if anything, he has been assessed as above average intelligence— is having extreme learning difficulties. He finds it difficult to keep up—and he is only in his second year at primary school—with the rest of his class. The level of IQ at the school is quite high. He has difficulty keeping up in 'both reading and numbers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, the school wished him to be assessed, and he has been assessed twice. There are great problems in getting an appointment with a child psychologist in the Lanarkshire area, because there are comparatively few of them. The Strathclyde regional authority, with some justification, because of pressure from the Government on education expenditure, has tried to cut back on recruitment of child psychologists when posts become vacant, and therefore the work load of those in the posts is increasing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think it immodest of me to say that the fact that I am a Member of Parliament means that I probably get appointments more quickly than others, without exerting pressure. Yet we still had to wait three or four weeks for the second assessment by a child psychologist. For others, the wait would probably be considerably longer. Therefore, a child deemed by the school to need assessment, has to wait a considerable time before that assessment can be made. For a period of weeks or months he has to plough on with the same sort of educational provision as Re has had, and therefore may be falling further and further behind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Anyone who knows anything at all about education—I know that you do, Mr. Gourlay—will know that the first two years in a school, or perhaps the first three years, are absolutely vital to a child's education, especially in terms of reading and numbers. Once a child starts to fall behind, he will fall further and further behind, because the learning difficulty is compounded at each stage. The fewer words he knows, the more difficult it is for him to learn. Each time the class moves on, he finds it more difficult to keep up, and he drops further behind. He then begins to feel that he is a failure, and once that happens he begins to lose his desire to learn. He may become a nuisance in the classroom and cause disruption. Therefore, the longer the delay in assessing a child, the greater will be his problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can speak only for Strathclyde, and I may be speaking only for one area of Strathclyde, but it is a multi-deprived area where there are probably many children with learning difficulties, as multi-deprivation and learning difficulties go hand in hand. But it seems to me that, at any rate in Lanarkshire, however hard people try—and they are very willing to try—the assessment is often too long delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that, under the financial pressures
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0236">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

the Government are placing on them, the education authorities will be able to employ extra child psychologists or the Health Service will be able to employ extra health visitors. It is the view of Warnock that health visitors will have to play a bigger role in assessing children and in spotting early those who will require special treatment. At present, the authorities do not have the means to assess the children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hamilton is extremely lucky. There is a unit there —it is not a special education unit—where children with learning difficulties can be sent for an hour a day for, perhaps, three or four months. During that time they work in small groups. There may be only two or three children to a teacher, and that teacher is therefore able to give those children concentrated attention and, in most cases, to bring them up to the standard that they should have attained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the sort of unit that education authorities should be running, but it is only a single unit and at any one time it can take in only about 20 children from the whole of Lanarkshire In the present circumstances it is not possible for the education authority to increase the number of places in that unit, and children are already being turned away because there are not enough places.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing provisions that the education authorities can make are not sufficient to enable them to carry out even the very limited application of the Warnock report's recommendations that is required in the Bill. I have spoken mainly about the assessment that needs to be made at the early stages, but the problem is a continuing one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to re-emphasise my point about the health visitors. What we are discussing falls mainly within the education service, but the health visitors and those who work at the clinics to which parents take their babies to be weighed and assessed are employed in the Health Service. Health visitors will need more training if they are to carry out the assessments required under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The clause deals with the need to assess and record children.

	<span class='label label-info column'>418</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The clause provides only for the machinery to deal with the assessment of children and young persons with special educational needs. It does not deal with how the assessment should be made, which is what the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) is considering. How assessments are made and the quality of assessments is not in dispute in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In that case, Mr. Gourlay, I hope that you will not mind if I read the proposed section 61 (1), which says
	<br><blockquote><p>"It shall not be lawful for an education authority to establish, under section 60 of this Act, that a child has pronounced, specific or complex special educational needs such as require continuing review and to record him unless he has undergone a process of assessment including a medical examination and a psychological examination for the purpose of affording to the authority advice as to his special educational needs".</p></blockquote>
I agree that the clause mainly deals with the machinery of recording, but a local authority cannot record a child unless it has carried out that medical examination and psychological examination.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local authorities cannot even start the machinery with which the clause is concerned until they have done the assessment. They cannot prove to a parent or, presumably, the Scottish Education Department that they wish a child to be recorded, until the assessment has been done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reply to the hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) is that of course local authorities and schools do everything they can on assessments, but I suggest that the clause will widen the process of assessment. It will mean that more children will have to be assessed and that many will have to be assessed more carefully than they have been in the past. I suggest that they will find it difficult to expand their existing resources to do so. There are too many gaps now, and local authorities are already under pressure in making the present assessments. Most of (them work hard at it. Many child psychologists are grossly overworked. If we add this burden without adding extra staff and resources, it will be extremely difficult for those people to carry out that task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessment has to be a continuous process. That is certainly proposed throughout the clause. It will not be a one-off assessment. In order to continue recording, assessments must be made on a continuous basis to ascertain any further needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.15 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local education authorities will not find the process of assessment easy, or may not be able to carry it out at all, in view of the present pressures of educational provision. Therefore, I have some reservations about the clause. I should like to consult my hon Friend the Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) before we decide whether to vote against the clause, because there are some parts of it that we should like to see implemented.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried that if the clause were implemented as it stands—I am not talking about whether we ought to implement the rest of Wamock—we would raise false hopes in parents who think that their
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0237">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>419</span>
child has certain needs. We would raise their hopes, first, that an assessment would be made quickly, that the child would then be recorded, and things would happen quickly as a result. Having raised those false hopes, we would then not be able to give those children the help that they genuinely needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, I shall have reservations until I have heard the whole debate, when I shall decide whether we should support the clause. I wish to listen to the Minister's argument. Is he satisfied that there are enough child psychologists to ensure that the proposals are carried out? Are there sufficient health visitors to ensure that every child is checked on during the first two years of his life? Are there sufficient parents attending clinics so that their child can have one-year and two-year assessments? Many parents are invited to attend a clinic, but many do not take up that opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What are the figures? The Warnock report recommended that in England and Wales there should be one child psychologist for 5,000 children and young people up to the age of 19. Does Scotland have that ratio? If so, is the Minister satisfied that that is sufficient for that area? In the Highland region in particular, the distance that a child psychologist would have to travel is such that more would be required for fewer children, because much time would be spent travelling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to give some facts and figures. All of us have spoken a great deal about what ought to be done. I should have liked to argue at greater length, but I appreciate that I may even at present be beginning to stretch your patience, Mr. Gourlay. Will the Minister say whether the proposals could be carried out properly with existing resources, even in the limited terms of the clause?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William McKelvey 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Kilmarnock)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am opposed to the clause, because it has been deliberately drawn up to exclude any provision that might require additional expenditure. If it were enacted in its present form, local education authorities would not be obliged to extend their special educational services to cover the large percentage of children who have been identified by Warnook as needing help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all favour value for money, but every time we raise the question of finance, the Minister asks us where the money will come from. I am concerned about the clause, because the explanatory and financial memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The special educational needs provisions (clauses 3 and 4) will be carried out within existing resources."</p></blockquote>
I find it difficult to understand how that can be achieved. If it were merely a matter of recognising and recording those children who were in need of special education, that could be achieved without much extra cost. We could certainly record them. But surely we shall not leave the matter there. It is therefore a question of the necessary provisions that would cost money. We cannot even transfer finance from one part of the Bill to another. Indeed, the moneys involved—£100,000 in 1981-82 and £300,000
	<span class='label label-info column'>420</span>
in subsequent years—would not even cover the special requirements that I am talking about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Three priorities are identified on page 336 of the Warnock report. Although it is almost impossible to estimate the cost if Warnock were fully implemented, it has been suggested that it might have been about £200 million for England and Wales. On that basis, about £20 million would be needed for Scotland. I do not know where the authorities will find that additional £20 million—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are not discussing the financial provision for clause 4. That is made under the financial resolution passed by the House, which has accepted the principle. We are discussing how the operation of clause 4 wall affect authorities—that is, how they will implement such matters. That is what is relevant in this debate. Too many repetitions are occurring in respect of the financial aspect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. My hon Friend was right to quote from the explanatory and financial memorandum, which specifically refers to the financial implications of clauses 3 and 4. It says that everything must be done within existing resources. That includes the carrying out of assessments and the appeal procedure which come under clause 4. My hon Friend was probably right to say that authorities did not have the resources to carry out the assessments and the appeal procedure, and that the government would not allow them to have those resources. Surely we are entitled to make those criticisms in relation to clause 4.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I must draw the hon Gentleman's attention to the financial resolution, which makes provision for additional expenditure arising from appeals. With regard to the rest of the clause, it is not in order in a clause stand part debate to attempt to change the provision which says that the clause must be operated within existing resources.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was trying to say, Mr. Gourlay, that I found it difficult to imagine how authorities would be able to carry out the sentiments expressed in the clause under the existing financial arrangements. It is fair to say that that will create great difficulties for them unless the sole purpose of the clause is merely to perpetrate a cruel deception. In other words, the Government have paid lip service to the recommendations in Warnock. They have been sympathetic towards them, but being sympathetic is not good enough. We can all be sympathetic and we can all say what ought to be done, but if the Government are saying that it must be done within the present financial constraints, that is impossible. That is why I question the validity of the clause. There is no question about authorities being able to record children who are in need of extra educational facilities, but there is no point in keeping a record if nothing is to be done with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps more should have been said in the clause about the involvement of parents at a much earlier stage. I have experience of a case in which a child definitely had additional needs. The case was brought to my attention by the parent. The child had been
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0238">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>421</span>
reported and the education authority had decided, after consultation with the parent, to remove the child to a special school. The difficulty was that the father did not believe that the child was in need of additional educational facilities. He thought that she should have been kept in the class that she was in. The problem arose with the difference of opinion between him and the education authority.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having listened to the father, talked to the girl concerned, and received the somewhat restricted evidence of the education authority, I felt that the authority perhaps had a case. But what struck me was that it had failed to get the father to understand the difficulties. He would not give his permission for the child to be removed to another school and he made it plain to me that if the authorities were determined to carry out that course of action, he would uplift the child and if necessary move to a different part of the country. I understood that he could appeal to the Secretary of State and he did that. I am happy to say that after lengthy discussion with me—I was to act as his counsel at the appeal to the Secretary of State—he was successful in his appeal, so at least the appeal mechanism works.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, I think that that was merely a stay of execution. The girl is integrated into her present environment, and will possibly improve, but I am still concerned that perhaps she should have been placed in a school with special educational facilities. But the father was put off when he went to visit the school in which his daughter was to be placed and he saw children with varying degrees of need. There should be more facilities at an earlier stage to involve parents in a full discussion of their children's needs and how the children should be placed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether the appeals procedure set out in this clause will assist that. I hope that it will, but an appeal to a sheriff is not one which I should favour. I know the difficulties when I hark back to the question of finance. But if these facilities are to be provided and are to be meaningful, the education authorities will be left with the problem of their priorities. As we have already heard that their cash priorities lie in other areas, such as the provision of books, I cannot see that the clause will have any real meaning for education authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.30 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What the clause does not state—and what it should perhaps have stated—is that there will be a requirement to appoint teachers with special responsibility for these children once they have been recognised and recorded. There would need to be appropriate improvements in the overall level of teaching, ancillary, and nursing staff to ensure that the schools were adapted to cope with the problem, but there is no way in which that will be done under clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to a point that we discussed on Tuesday —the fact that no regard is taken in the clause to the question of stopping corporal punishment at schools for the handicapped. I have some information on that subject which the Committee may find useful. The newspaper article in question does not refer specifically to schools for the handicapped but refers to a school at which there were more beatings, according to the Society of Teachers Opposed to Physical Punishment,
	<span class='label label-info column'>422</span>
than at any other British school. During 10]days, it says,
	<br><blockquote><p>"there were 89 cases of corporal punishment. One boy was beaten on seven occasions, another on five.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Offences included 'out of bounds … nuisance in class… no equipment… smoking … jeans and still no note … fooling on sports … bullying … vandalism.'"</p></blockquote>
STOPP is demanding that such corporal punishment should be ended. The point that I want to make is that not only is corporal punishment, in STOPP's words, "an affront to the standards of a civilised society", but that the article states that
	<br><blockquote><p>"A boy aged ten who had suffered from a stroke in infancy, leaving the right side of his body paralysed, was 'slippered.'"</p></blockquote>
Reports such as that indicate that there is much more beating than people are prepared to admit or to recognise. I do not say that beating is standard procedure in any of the special schools—far from it. The hon Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) made the point that a great deal of love and affection was shown to the children in those schools, and I readily agree. Nevertheless, it is a great pity that we have wasted an opportunity to protect those children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the financial point has been covered, and I know that I would strain your patience, Mr. Gourlay, if I returned to that matter. It is not my intention to consider where the money could come from. But unless the authorities can find the money, the clause will be meaningless. It will be a mere catalogue of platitudes. I shall be interested to hear the Minister's defence of the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 is very long, covering more than 13 pages of the Bill. It is almost farcical for a Committee of this size and this nature to pretend to discuss it in the detail that it merits. A few speeches have been made from the Labour Benches, but there has not been one speech from the Conservative Benches. The Minister has been given a well prepared brief by his civil servants. He probably does not understand it, but he will read it out, and then the clause will be passed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to start by making this protest. In the future, we should consider adopting the same procedure as was adopted in the case of the English Bill, when a pre-legislative Special Standing Committee took evidence from all the organisations and individuals that might be concerned, directly or indirectly, with the implementation of the legislation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>[Mr. ALBERT MCQUARRIE 
	<i>in the Chair]</i></p>

	<p>Incidentally, the Chair at one point gave an undertaking that copies of that evidence would be made available to us. They have never been made available, and we have been left to get copies from the Vote Office. I have a copy of the evidence here, and it is extremely valuable. The Committee took evidence during three sittings from many people, including Mrs. Warnock, but not from parents. Evidence was also taken from organisations such as Dr. Barnado's and The Spastics Society. In each sensitive matters evidence should be given by parents, not only in collective organisations, but as individuals, because they would be very much affected if the Bill were enacted.</p>

	<p>I draw the Minister's attention to an unsolicited letter that I received from the chairman of the education Committee in Fife. He is a coal miner and is a highly dedicated and compassionate person who is also a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0239">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>423</span>
parent. I do not know whether he gives the view of his committee, but I suspect that it is his own reaction to the appeals procedure proposed in the clause. He writes:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The proposal that in future parents of handicapped youngsters would be able to appeal to the sheriff I regard as being callous and without regard for the circumstances under which these parents are trying to cope with their handicapped child. We believe that these parents should not be required to resort to the courts on appeal but that the Secretary of State should retain his powers to give a finding on an appeal using the resources available to him and which we believe would be regarded as a more compassionate and sensitive method of dealing with parents' wishes in placing handicapped pupils."</p></blockquote>
I cannot put myself into the position of parents with a child labouring under this kind of handicap. But I talked to some of them, and it is very difficult to hold a conversation with them without being highly emotionally involved. To suggest that such parents should in the final analysis have to resort to a sheriff court seems to be blatantly insensitive. It is inhuman to a degree. The cost, which the Government say is negligible, is irrelevant in this context. It does not matter whether it costs anything. It is abhorrent that an ordinary citizen in Glenrothes or in any mining village in my constituency should have to resort to the sheriff. The Minister should understand that.</p>

	<p>When Mr. Gourlay was in the Chair, Mr. McQuarrie, he was seeking, I thought unfairly, narrowly to restrict us in our references to resources, but the whole crux of the Bill is the resources available. I quote from the Government White Paper, "Special Educational Needs in Scotland," Cmnd 7991, paragraph 4:
	<br><blockquote><p>"While the need for financial restraints precludes early progress towards the development of new educational provision on the lines of the detailed recommendations in the Report"</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>—the Warnock report—
	<br><blockquote><p>"many of which have substantial implications for central and local government expenditure, the Government are satisfied that much can be done within existing resources, given the widespread good will and concern which already exists both among those directly involved and in society as a whole".</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>In other words, the Government were saying "We will go through the motions of setting up machinery, hanging up the stockings for these handicapped children, but tomorrow morning they will be empty— and the next morning they will be empty, but the gesture is hanging up the stockings. We are making a declaration of intent."</p>

	<p>I believe that that is worthless—and Warnock says so, too. It is not only worthless, but the end could be worse than the beginning. I quote from what Mrs. Warnock writes in 
	<i>The Times Educational Supplement</i> on 13 March 1981:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I said, in evidence to the Standing Committee"</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>—this was on the English Bill, but it applies equally to the Scottish Bill—
	<br><blockquote><p>"(and I am prepared to go on saying this till I lose my voice), that without some special fundings, the 1981 Education Bill will not only do no good; it will do positive harm. More important, I believe that without specific grants for teacher training our whole educational provision, not 
	<i>only</i> that for children with special needs, will fairly soon be seen to be hopelessly ineffective and inadequate."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>In clauses 3 and 4 local authorities are specifically prevented from spending any extra resources on these
	<span class='label label-info column'>424</span>
children. I know that the Minister will reply "Oh well, within their existing resources they can change their priorities." But even within that, if one looks at the White Paper on public expenditure over the next three or four years, one sees that there is to be a slashing of the education provision, particularly for teachers' salaries. There will be enormous reductions in the quality of education in the round that can be provided by the education authorities. The clause and the Bill must be considered in that context.</p>

	<p>I have quotations from the 
	<i>Glasgow Herald</i> and 
	<i>The Scotsman</i> on the overall effects of the Government's White Paper. With regard to clauses 3 and 4 it is worth quoting again what COSLA says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The omissions which concern the Convention are that resources are not to be made available for the expansion of nursery education and assessment of the pre-school handicapped or for the extension of educational facilities for the post-school-aged population. The omission of any reference to the Special Education Research Group as recommended by Warnock is also to be regretted since much work requires to be done in the preparation of suitable materials and programmes for the handicapped."</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>It continues in that vein, and if one looks at all the evidence given by every specialised group to the Standing Committee on the English Bill, one sees that every one of them criticises the Government for willing the end without willing the means. That is a callous confidence trick.</p>

	<p>11.45 am</p>

	<p>Parents will have their hopes raised by this legislation. If they want to buy a copy of the Bill, it will cost four quid, so they would be able to buy a copy only with great difficulty. But their hopes are being raised that something will be done for their children. When parents find that a bit of machinery is to be created in St. Andrew's House, and local authorities are told " Right, get on with it. But your resources will not be kept stable; they will be reduced ", they will ask " How the blazes can we do it?" I object very much to that approach by the Government.</p>

	<p>I had prepared a long speech, Mr. McQuarrie, but I expected that Mr. Gourlay would be in the Chair—as I suspect he may be later—and he would have ruled much of it out of order, although I think that that would have been done mistakenly. I think that we may need to consider taking some action in due course on this kind of ruling, because it is highly restrictive and unnecessary.</p>

	<p>The Government have not heard the last of this. The next clause to be discussed deals with the assisted places scheme, and the Government can find money for that. The Minister knows well that I produced in the Committee the Defence Blue Paper. The Government say that the estimated cost of the total implementation of Warnock is about £250 million for England and Wales, and I suppose that it would cost about £20 million for Scotland. That is the cost of two Tornado aircraft. The Government can find the money, but the will is not there.</p>

The clauses involve in large measure the lengths to which we can go in implementing the Warnock recommendations. I repeat that unless and until there is a Government willing to reassess their priorities and willing to give resources to local authorities, so that they can carry out their obligations to handicapped children, the whole of the Bill is a massive confidence trick on the parents of those handicapped children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

May I just mention some of the points brought up by Opposition Members, which may satisfy the hon Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) that I am not reading out a prepared brief, but am trying to answer the debate. We have had an interesting debate, with speeches from four Opposition Members, which is a fair number.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a theme running through all the speeches of Opposition Members, I hope that they will forgive me if I do not mention them all by name, because the points that they made were raised by more than one hon Member. I will do him the courtesy of mentioning first the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill), who is leading for the Opposition at present. He said that the clause was not required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must tell the hon Gentleman that the Bill introduces several features not capable of being effected by administrative action only. One is the ending of the distinction between handicapped children and others. Another is that the essential feature of the Warnock report is the formal protection of the rights of parents in the extended assessment recording process. Thirdly, there is the extension of special education measures to the over-16s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall come later to the question of resources, which comes into every speech from the Opposition. The hon Member asked a question on one particular aspect of this. The deployment of available resources in education has to be a matter for education authorities. Naturally, we regret that funds for education generally have to take account of the national economic situation, but that will be relieved by the current demographic trends, as the hon Gentleman knows. I completely disagree with the idea that every provision in the Bill needs money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are beginning to get a wee bit tired of hearing such things from Ministers with responsibility for education matters. Will the Minister tell
	<span class='label label-info column'>426</span>
us at what point, with falling school rolls, the fall in resources has to be compensated for? At what point do diseconomies of scale start to come in to play? It is not enough to say that more money will be spent per capita, if provision for the number of heads does not meet the overall financial requirements of the operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a very dangerous argument. The fact that falling school rolls afford the opportunity for more money to be spent per pupil can on occasion mean that, if there are diseconomies of scale, the operation of schools becomes very difficult because there is not enough money to pay overheads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The change is already taking place and has happened. Although less money is being spent on education, the amount per pupil is higher. I disagree altogether with the idea that every provision in the Bill needs money. It is essential to make what progress we can now to provide the foundation for early development, particularly the enactment of the Warnock principles designed to remove the apparent stigma of the label of "handicapped", which will be welcomed by parents.

Nearly all education authorities in Scotland are trying to carry out their commitments and duties to the best of their ability, within the resources available. Those referred to in chapters 3 and 4 of Warnock amount to about 2 per cent, of the school population. Therefore, there is nothing to stop an authority, if it wishes, concentrating a little more on that 2 per cent, than on the other 98 per cent. I think that that point has been taken by such authorities as were mentioned by my hon Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie), in regard to what is happening in Grampian and in Strathclyde.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister remind the Committee of what happened just a few months after the Government came to power? Will he tell us by how much he cut—in the summer budget of 1979—the amount of money going to special education?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not in a position to answer that, but I shall get the answer for the hon Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Opposition Members keep referring to cuts in education. I shall not go on to talk about the International Year of Disabled People, Mr. Gourlay, because you will rule me out of order, and I shall be speaking about that in another place. But I remind the Opposition that there is another aspect of this matter, and it concerns what is happening in areas of health and social work, for which I have responsibility. In those areas, year by year and in the last two years, the amount of money spent in real terms has been increased.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the point is that the needs of the community for health care are increasing. More and more people are living longer and therefore require more public expenditure. In making those unqualified assertions, the Minister is doing a disservice to the Health Service. He is imposing upon it burdens which it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0241">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>427</span>
cannot carry, given the change in the population profile of the country.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was making the point that was being studiously ignored by Labour Members. In real terms we are spending more money on health, social work and the caring professions than was ever spent by a Labour Government. That is my point, and it is the one that is being studiously ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) raised another point about the under-fives and over-16s, who are certainly not ignored. We should be glad to do more. As I said, we could spend twice the amount of money on health, and we shall spend more as soon as economic circumstances permit. But power is given to local education authorities to assess, record and provide education for under-fives, which means that the authorities can use all the available resources to meet the greatest need according to their judgment of priorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards the over-16s, the Bill first extends the recording procedure to that group, which was previously excluded from special education. Secondly, it says that provision for the needs of a young person at school must be maintained while he is there. Thirdly, we have provided for a pre-leaving-age assessment to identify future needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon Members continually raised the matter of what they felt to be the lack of resources. I shall have to be careful, Mr. Gourlay, not to stray into those spheres where you have pulled up hon Members, although there has been a lot of talk about that. Mr. McQuarrie, who followed you in the Chair, spoke of "drifting away". Throughout the Committee proceedings we have heard synonyms—I have counted about 12—for taxing people more, for asking people to pay—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Switching.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to switching in a minute, so the hon Member should remain patient.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards raising taxes or rents, the phrase used, instead of "making us pay more", are "cash commitment", "will the means", "financial injection", "make funds available"—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it not tedious and repetitious for the Minister, in every speech he makes, to read out a list of synonyms for words for public expenditure? Every time he gets up to reply, that is all he does. It is offensive to us because he does not attempt to answer our arguments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am listening to the Minister's speech. Whenever he is out of order, I shall make the necessary ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to tell the hon Member that the list is not much longer, so that to give it will take only about 30 seconds. The other phrases are "monetary support", "cash underpinning", "put one's money where one's mouth is", "resource provision", "extra resources", "provide finance", "money in the kitty"—in other words, "increase taxation."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When I asked what would be cut, supposing the
	<span class='label label-info column'>428</span>
resources for a Labour or Conservative Government were the same, the hon Member for Fife, Central said that he would cut defence. Therefore, I suggest to him that we spend the same proportion of GNP on defence as Russia. Would that satisfy him?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. I am interested in what the Minister is saying. Presumably we shall be able to reply to his arguments in due course.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I allowed a sentence or so from the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. O'Neill) about defence before I stopped him. I presume that the Minister is merely replying to that, because I shall not allow him to develop the argument any further than I allowed the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12 noon</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. Gourlay. The Minister criticised us when we referred to additional resources. He criticised me specifically when I said that all requirements in health, education, and so on could be met by switching resources from defence. I can produce many figures. If the Minister is allowed to put that on record, we should be entitled to reply in kind, because that is the crux of the argument.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The effectiveness of the Bill depends on resources. Our argument is directed to that—namely, where they will be coming from. The Minister said that the Government could not provide them or that they were unwilling to do so. Therefore, the Opposition should have an automatic right of reply in relation to where resources can be made available, not only for the implementation of clauses 3 and 4, but for other parts of the Bill. If the Minister is allowed to widen the argument, as he has in the last 10 minutes, we ought to have the right to reply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: So far, the Minister has not widened the argument of resources further than the hon Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire. I am allowing him to reply briefly to the hon Gentleman's point, but that will not widen the debate. I have already ruled, and will continue to rule, that the argument about resources and where the money will be found is not relevant to the clause stand part debate. The financial position has been clarified twice by me and it is also mentioned in the financial memorandum and the money resolution. I have given my ruling.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept your ruling, Mr. Gourlay, although I have been heavily provoked on the subject of expenditure and particularly the subject of cutting defence spending. I will confine myself to one last sentence on this matter. I remind the hon Member for Fife, Central that Britain spends 4.9 per cent, of the gross national product on defence, whereas Russia spends between 11 per cent, and—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I said that I would allow the Minister to reply, but he has already given certain figures, and since there were no figures in the original point—it was merely a general principle that was
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0242">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>429</span>
referred to—he should restrict himself to replying in general terms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I. accept that, Mr. Gourlay, but the point I was trying to make was that if the United Kingdom spent the same proportion of GNP on defence as Russia, we would have money for nothing else. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is difficult for the Chairman to hear and for 
	<i>Hansard</i> to produce an accurate transcript when there is so much noise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I turn now to the remarks of the hon Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton). I had some difficulty in following some of his arguments. You intervened two or three times during the course of his speech, Mr. Gourlay. If you could not always follow the hon Gentleman's arguments, you will understand that it was even more difficult for someone like me with limited intelligence. The hon Gentleman delivered his usual tirade about resources and how there were never enough. I have admitted throughout this debate that there are never enough resources for everything that we would like to do in this area. We know that that is so. It is no good blaming the Government, or any Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I restricted my remarks specifically to the clause. The point that I was making was about the resources available for the provisions in the clause. I was talking not about extra resources for anything else but about whether the authorities would be able to fulfil the obligations that the Government are laying on them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon Gentleman had only waited, I would have taken up the points that he made during his long speech. He made two points. He asked whether the provisions of clause 4 could be carried out within the resources available. The answer to that is "Yes". The numbers likely to be recorded should not differ from those now being ascertained for special education. Both the Bill and the Warnock report recognise the extent of good practice among education authorities carrying out assessments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is a major difference in the clause. The Minister has just referred to the designation for special education, but the clause refers to children with special educational needs. Those designated for special education and those recorded as having special educational needs are two different categories, and the second category is much wider than the category of those ascertained for special education.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I stick to the answer that I have given to the hon Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon Gentleman also asked whether assessment posed additional demands. The answer is "No". In most areas the proposed assessment procedures are those that already operate for ascertainment. The process will not be more careful or more extensive, but it will be recorded in more detail for the parents' benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to say that the numbers of psychologists—
	<span class='label label-info column'>430</span>
another point that Warnock noted—-produces a generous ratio, more favourable than in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Maxton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not like to keep interrupting the Minister, but the Warnock report was specific about England and Wales. It said that there should be one child psychologist to 5,000 children and young persons. The implication was that England and Wales did not achieve that. The Minister is now saying that the Scottish ratio is more favourable, but I should like him to tell us whether it reaches that figure. I suggested that it needed to be more favourable in Scotland, because child psychologists had to cover wider geographical distances in certain parts of Scotland than in England and Wales.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apparently the ratio does reach the figures mentioned by the hon Member. I had hoped that he would give some credit when we are doing better in Scotland than south of the border—but the point went completely ignored.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the third of the four Opposition speeches that we heard this morning—that of the hon Member for Kilmarnock (Mr. McKelvey). Again, there was the usual mention, I regret to say, of cash resources and corporal punishment. I have nothing specific to comment on which has not come up when dealing with the other speeches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting that the hon Member for Fife, Central and I have both been keeping an eye on the proceedings of a Committee sitting in another Room. I think that he knows that there is a technical difference. The equivalent English Bill last year contained no Warnock provisions, but we took the opportunity to include the Warnock provisions in this Bill. The Committee meeting along the Corridor is a different type of Committee hearing a lot of evidence. We took a lot of evidence in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As in England and Wales, extensive consultations were carried out on the Warnock report and on our White Paper. Since the Bill was published, discussions have taken place with bodies such as COSLA, the Scottish Consumer Council, the Scottish Parent Teacher Association, the Scottish Association for the Mentally Handicapped and the Educational Institute of Scotland. We look forward to further extensive discussion about all aspects of the Bill's detailed implementation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is different from having evidence taken in public and reported in full, as is happening with the English Bill. If we had had that, we, as ordinary Back-Bench Members, would have had more information available to us than we have had so far. Organisations can write to us and summarise their arguments, but that is not the same as getting detailed evidence in writing and orally, as is happening with the English Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This Bill was published last December, when the Warnock report was three years old.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

materially different, why was there not a Special Standing Committee set up to examine this Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. It is not in order for the Committee to discuss the setting up of Committees or any matters of that nature. 1 hope that the Minister will reply without referring much to that matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. To discuss this matter fully, it would have been helpful if we had had a Special Standing Committee along the lines of the English one.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon Gentleman cannot raise that matter in this Committee. This Committee was set up by the House to discuss the Bill, and that is what we must seek to do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fairgrieve</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I realise that I cannot reply in detail, because if you rule out part of the question, Mr. Gourlay, you rule out part of the answer. I can say that the equivalent English Bill was produced before ours.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other Committee is dealing with the completely different and non-controversial matter of Warnock only. I did not realise that Opposition Members were so keen on doing everything in exactly the same way as it is done in England and Wales. I thought that they would be glad to take a Scottish initiative and do it in a slightly different way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope to answer questions to some extent without using the brief that the hon Member for Fife, Central predicted that I would use. There are some matters about the clause which should be put in the 
	<i>Official Report</i> in the stand part debate. At times the debate became a little heated, but a useful discussion has taken place on the provisions of this clause, which is concerned with the arrangements to be made for children with severe and continuing disabilities, essentially for children like those now in special education—about 2 per cent, of the school population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be helpful to remind Members of the extent of these provisions and how they build on existing statute. We have retained the present requirement that authorities must try to make parents aware how important it is for special educational needs to be identified early, and how this can be done. Authorities will still have to respond to requests made by parents for assessment, unless a request is frivolous. Otherwise, they will themselves have power to assess with a view to recording both the under-fives and those over 16 receiving school education. In respect of over 16s this represents an extension of education authority powers made in the interests of the young people concerned. It may be a modest improvement seen against the range of Warnock recommendations for 16-19s, but I am disappointed that no one has given us even a little credit for it—or commenced the voluntary element which we have introduced into our provision for this age group by ensuring that their recording requires their consent and that they may at any time require it to be discontinued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For children of school age, an authority's function will in certain respects not differ materially from its present one; it will still be bound to identify children who need educational provision to meet their special needs. The approach to assessment and recording, whether of a child or a young person, will, however, be transformed, because it will be directed towards having
	<span class='label label-info column'>432</span>
as its end product a record. This subject was raised by my hon Friend the Member for Argyll (Mr. MacKay).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The record, if I may continue, at least for the present, to call it that, sets out in detail the impairments giving rise to special educational needs, the nature and extent of these needs and the measures intended to meet them. This will indeed be a running record, showing society's attempt, through an education authority, to make the best provision it can for those who are handicapped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Setting aside the question whether this focal document is to be a record, a statement or a log, or is to have some other and generally acceptable title that has so far eluded us, the provisions on recording brought into the debate the question of resources. Discussion ranged over the needs of the under-fives, the over-16s and the teachers seeking to meet special educational needs, which of course were priorities for Warnock.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our appeal provisions, which give the parents of handicapped children the same rights as others in respect of school placing and also an entitlement to the special consideration such children must receive, passed without comment. I hope that this means that they were found acceptable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have continued the provisions for regular review of the needs of children for whom special provision is made, and we have introduced a pre-leaving age assessment. This will not only help to determine what post-16 provision should be made for individual children, but will help the various agencies to build-up a picture of demand so that we can move towards the Warnock ideal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, we have provided that the Secretary of State can make regulations about the record, about the modifications of assessment procedures and about the conduct of schools and classes taking recorded children. These will all be the subject of consultation, as will questions of policy, such as assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise fully what has been said by Opposition hon Members about the question of resources. We know that in this area all of us would like to spend more money, and that will be done when the country can afford to spend more money. It is regrettable that countries in Western Europe which 20 years ago had a lower standard than ours now have a higher standard, because of their own efforts, and can spend more than us on such provisions. I hope that our people will put that matter right by becoming a wealthier nation and thus spending more money in these areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of all the reservations about resources, we have produced a workmanlike set of proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dennis Canavan 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Stirlingshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clause 4 is supposed to be one of the less controversial parts of the Bill. The Government claim that it implements the Warnock report. It does nothing of the kind, because, as several hon Members have said, no extra resources are being given; there are not even the necessary financial resources being given to implement the inadequate clause, such as it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is no use the Minister's claiming that his Department is so bankrupt that it cannot give local education authorities enough money to implement the provisions of clause 4, because he failed to respond to the point that I put to him earlier, that one of the first things that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0244">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>433</span>
the Government did was to shift money away from disadvantaged children—those suffering from mental or physical handicaps, or both—and at the same time put extra money into private fee-paying schools. The Government gave those schools a 40 per cent, increase.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is no use the Minister's saying that. What 1 said was based on a parliamentary reply which I received from him not long after he took office. I shall give him the appropriate 
	<i>Hansard</i> reference later. Not long after taking office, the Minister took money away from the children who are supposed to be catered for under this clause. [
	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Gourlay. Is it in order for a Minister to barrack a member of the Committee when he is speaking? We have had a stream of "Absolute nonsense" from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are occasions when remarks are made from a sedentary position, but the Chair does not condone them. Sometimes it does not hear them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate your difficult position, Mr. Gourlay. I am sure that if you were to use the method of punishment advocated by the Minister, he would get six of the best from you. But, unfortunately, I know that you, like me, are more civilised than that, so your chastisement of the Minister is of the nonviolent variety. Nevertheless, I still think that it is a sad day when a Minister responsible for education has to be rebuked by the Chair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My fear is that clause 4 will, without the back-up of financial and other resources, build up false expectations in the minds of many parents with a child or children suffering from physical or mental handicaps, or both. It is incumbent upon the Minister to give a better reply than those to which we have been treated so far. Later we shall discuss the provision of more resources for fee-paying schools. Surely the Government should cut that out altogether and give the money to the children whom we are dealing with under clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister at least proved one thing in his contribution to the debate—that he can read the Civil Service brief—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not very well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: —but not very well. He did not even sound as if he understood it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that clause 4 catered for only 2 per cent.—and I think that he said "possibly less"—of the school population. Warnock was charged with examining the educational needs of a much larger range of children than 2 per cent. At one stage, it was estimated that possibly 20 per cent, of the school population might have special educational needs of one sort or another. We are talking about children who may not suffer from severe handicaps, whether mental or physical. If we include children who at some stage in their school life require remedial education, we are talking about approximately 20 per cent, of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>434</span>
Will the Minister tell us what, if anything, the clause will do to help those children? If we are to change the whole method of assessment of children with special educational needs to a better form of assessment at an earlier—perhaps pre-school—age, and a continuous assessment throughout school life, the number of such children identified will possibly be much higher than the 2 per cent, that the Minister cited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister envisage that the number of recorded children will remain at a fairly stable 2 per cent., or will the multi-professional assessment proposed in the clause mean that a significantly higher percentage of children will be identified and possibly recorded? What will he do about catering for their special educational needs? I do not think that the Minister understood that at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Warnock report refers to the monitoring of whole age groups of children. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Close and continuous observation of pupils' progress by their teachers needs to be supplemented by procedures of various kinds which assist the identification of children with special educational needs … We therefore recommend that local education authorities should operate procedures for monitoring whole age groups of children at least three or four times during their school life."</p></blockquote>
Will clause 4 mean that whole age groups of the school population will be monitored in that way? If so, that again brings us back to resources. Virtually every clause of the Bill, and virtually every line of this clause, requires the provision of extra resources. If the Minister expects education authorities, in implementing clause 4, to have large-scale monitoring exercises of whole age groups of the school population—possibly three or four times in the life of each child—where will he find the extra resources? The Minister should tell us that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the multi-disciplinary assessment referred to in the proposed new section 61(1). It mentions
	<br><blockquote><p>"a process of assessment including a medical examination and a psychological examination for the purpose of affording to the authority advice as to his"—</p></blockquote>
the child's—
	<br><blockquote><p>"special educational needs and whether or not they ought to record him".</p></blockquote>
Again, I think that the Minister admitted that it might have been a mistake not to define the multi-professional team in more detail. I fully agree with the concept of multi-professional assessment. I think that it is much better than the previous rigid method of categorisation of special kinds of handicap and the attempt to lay down those different categories in statutes or regulations. One cannot pigeonhole children on the basis of strict categories of handicap. I therefore welcome that aspect of clause 4. Rather than the attempt to shove the handicapped child into one of a number of pre determined pigeonholes, there will be a more child- centred approach to the assessment, so that the individual needs of the child will be more closely identified. One hopes that those needs will also be more adequately catered for, although without the necessary resources I realise that that may not always be so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several members of the Committee, including me, pointed out how the important role of the teacher had been excluded. The Minister said that he would take that point on board and might consider it on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We can therefore pass on to some other aspect of the clause that has not been discussed on an amendment. That is the purpose of a clause stand part debate. This debate is not an opportunity to reiterate the arguments already adduced in support of amendments—particularly amendments that have been defeated. The hon Gentleman was not present during the earlier part of the sitting. Most of his remarks have been a repetition of what has already been discussed on clause stand part. I therefore hope that the hon Gentleman will make some new points on the clause.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am about to make a new point, Mr. Gourlay, about the multi-professional team by which, under clause 4, the child will be assessed. The Warnock report makes specific reference not only to the teacher—a reference that has been omitted from the Bill—but to other professionals such as a health visitor and social worker. That has not been discussed on an amendment. I hope that the points I made earlier—points put to us by teachers' organisations such as the Educational Institute of Scotland—about the exclusion of teachers from the team will also be adhered to with regard to the desirability of including social workers and health visitors in the team when appropriate. I hope that the Minister will put down an amendment on that matter on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although there is no specific reference in the Bill to the teacher, the health visitor or the social worker, there is a specific reference, strangely enough, to the role of the sheriff. I wonder whether the sheriff is the best person to make a judgment on this matter. I have here a letter from a convener of education in one of the Scottish education authorities. He refers to the role of the sheriff. I quote;
	<br><blockquote><p>"Another important change is that a Parent of a recorded child will require to appeal to the Sheriff if a request for placement at a school other than that provided by the Education Authority is refused by the appeals committee.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"I feel that this should be a responsibility still of the Secretary of State for the following reasons."</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>"He has the availability of resources to compile and consider all information relevant to the appeal."</p></blockquote>
The Secretary may have the resources, but, as we have seen, he is not using them very well to cater for the needs of the children. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State has statutory responsibility to provide adequate resources. Imperfect though he may be, he has at least one advantage over the sheriff, because he has access to educational advisers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sheriff may have no experience of the mainstream of Scottish education—never mind the special parts of the educational system which deal with these children. Too many Scottish sheriffs have been to private fee-paying schools and know next to nothing about ordinary Scottish schools, and even less about the special schools and classes in which some of these children are, or to which parents wish their children to be admitted—or perhaps to which they do not want them to be admitted. So although I am strongly opposed to many of the education policies of the present Secretary of State, I nevertheless think that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>436</span>
prime responsibility on this matter should rest with the Secretary of State rather than with the sheriff.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. McKelvey</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon Friend was perhaps temporarily absent from the Committee when I mentioned an appeal with which I was involved. The circumstances in which the appeal was heard by the Secretary of State for Scotland led me to believe that the parent in that case had had a fair and impartial hearing and under those circumstances he was successful. Having considered the aspects of that case, I doubt whether a sheriff would have found in his favour. I think that my hon Friend is correct in drawing the distinction between the way that a Secretary of State and a sheriff handle such an appeal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Canavan</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon Friend for his helpful intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second reason why I doubt that the sheriff is the best person for the job is illustrated by another quotation from the same education convener:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Parents who are already having to cope with a handicapped child should not be subjected to the trauma of a Sheriff's Court and all that is associated with that."</p></blockquote>
It is often a traumatic experience when a handicapped child arrives in a family. It often takes time for the rest of the family to adjust to the handicapped child. I have grave doubt about what clause 4 proposes, because if there is any disagreement between the education authority and the child's parents about the educational needs of the child and about the type of school that the child is to attend, the parents of the child will be virtually forced to drag through the whole judicial procedure of sheriff courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that that is wrong. I do not think that a court is the best place to deal with such a problem. It would cause great anxiety to the parents, because, rightly or wrongly, many parents think that a sheriff court is a place where criminals or alleged criminals appear. Parents may feel at a tremendous disadvantage if they have to appear before the sheriff and state their case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In some circumstances the child would be dragged in front of the sheriff too. What qualifications does he have to decide the degree of handicap of a child which will enable him to make a judgment on the type and quality of education that should be given to that child?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents do not comply with the requirements of clause 4, they can be fined up to £50. But the person who should be fined for not implementing the clause is the Secretary of State, because he is not providing the money. Under the clause, he will have statutory responsibilities, yet there is no provision under which he can be fined. Perhaps we can consider a suitable amendment along those lines on Report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If parents do not face up to their responsibilities in respect of their children, there must be an inbuilt incentive for them to do so. Therefore, as a last resort it may be appropriate in some circumstances to impose a fine if parents neglect their children's needs. But it is sheer hypocrisy for the Secretary of State to make his draftsmen include statutory provision for parents to be punished if they neglect their duties when he will be neglecting his. Nothing at all will happen to him by way of fine, censure or anything else. I go so far as to say that the Minister should be locked up because of the way in which he neglects his duties. Possibly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0246">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>437</span>
Scottish education and the Scottish Health Service would be better off without him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to my final point. Even I believe that clause 4 is an improvement on the status quo. It is one of the less contentious, less controversial parts of the Bill, although it is far from perfect; indeed, it is inadequate. Nevertheless, the legislative framework is an improvement on the status quo. However, during the course of the debate—we began to debate Warnock on Tuesday—we have had hardly any worthwhile contributions from Conservative Members, except when the Minister read his brief, which was written for him by civil servants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The purpose of amendment No. 115 is
	<span class='label label-info column'>438</span>
to narrow the category of education authority staff who are not eligible to serve on appeal committees. It will thus make it possible for a wide range of education authority employees, such as janitors and drivers, to serve on these committees. Representations were made to me by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities on this matter at my most recent meeting with it. On consideration, I think that the view it expressed was reasonable, and Amendment No. 115 gives effect to it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful that the Minister has taken the point made by COSLA. However, he has taken a long time to come round to that, because I think that those representations were made a considerable time ago. Nevertheless I am pleased that he has tabled those representations in the form of an amendment because we were intending to raise the matter with him at this stage. We were under the impression that there was, at one stage at least, a difference of legal opinion between COSLA advisers and his own. We are grateful that he has chosen this method of clarifying the position because certainly we would have questioned him on it. It is important that as many people as possible employed by education authorities have access to participation in the system, but certainly the director of education is one person about whom we would have reservations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that the Opposition have any hard-and-fast feelings about educational advisers. We realise that they are, in some respects, the lepers of the educational community and probably second only in the opprobrium stakes to college of education lecturers. However, we do not think that any group should necessarily be excluded, and we are grateful that the Minister is considering this in a less-restricted manner. We hope that the categories will become more flexible. If it is shown that there is no obstacle to others being involved in the procedure we hope that the Minister will keep the matter under review and that in subsequent legislation it will be reconsidered. We feel that the widest possible participation is desirable and we are grateful, for once, that the Minister has taken the advice of COSLA, even at this late stage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Amendment Nos. 115,116 and 117 broaden the scope from which people may be drawn to serve on appeal committees, but on the principle that clearly we want to disapply those persons whose particular role or job makes them a party to the actual case being discussed by the appeal committee. We are trying to make sure that no-one on an appeal committee will have been involved in the proceedings up to that stage.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 49, in page 50, line 35, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>"7. An appeal committee constituted in accordance with this Schedule shall be included in the bodies to which sections 45(4) and 46 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 (allowances) apply.".</p></blockquote>
The amendment is to permit members of appeal committees to be eligible for attendance allowance, financial-loss allowance and travel and subsistence expenses under the terms of sections 45 (1), 45 (4) and 46 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. I am sure that the amendment will therefore have the approval of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us how much money he will make available for allowances and whether it will be reflected in the rate support grant? If it will not be, will he discount this amount as one of the elements in the increase in the global sum which will be considered for unreasonable and excessive expenditure under clause 13 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill, which received its Third Reading last night?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have no major objections to allowances being provided for those participating in this sort of activity. We recognise that, although many of those on appeal committees will be involved primarily because of their interest in education and their desire to see justice being done, there is no reason why they should be penalised financially. For these reasons we welcome the amendment. But, at a time when the Government are seeking to impose controls and constraints on local authority expenditure, it would be unreasonable of the Minister to require local authorities to make these funds available unless some provision were made for this group within the rate support grant settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell us, first, how much he expects the amendment to cost in the first full year of operation and, secondly, whether he will make adequate provision under the rate support grant settlement to cover this expenditure?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The information which the hon Gentleman requests is in the explanatory and financial memorandum of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Fletcher</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not necessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Neill</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that it is not necessary. I know that he is an accountant, but he is not a lawyer, and we should prefer him to consult his officials before he gives assurances of that nature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go down the road of my hon Friend the Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. Canavan) and request that the Solicitor-General for Scotland be here. But it would be helpful if the Minister could give the matter some consideration, to make sure that the explanatory and financial memorandum relates not just to the setting up of appeal committees but to their maintenance and, if necessary, bring forward the necessary amendments on Report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Hamilton</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure whether my hon Friend has asked the question that I am about to put, but, if he has, I apologise for the tedious repetition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory and financial memorandum states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any extra expenditure by local authorities resulting from the appeals procedure would be negligible."</p></blockquote>
That was clearly written before the amendment was put down. It must be altered now. There will be several appeal committees in Scotland and they will involve some expense. I do not think that a figure for the estimated cost has yet been given or, more importantly, whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer is aware of it. It will affect the public sector borrowing requirement. We are all very concerned about resources and their correct application, and the Minister must have in mind some figure for the estimated cost of this matter over Scotland as a whole. As my hon Friend said, it would be unreasonable to ask local authorities to foot the bill. The Government must make provision from central sources if they want this amendment to be accepted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not prepared to find out the estimated cost, it is unreasonable for the Committee to be expected to accept an amendment with no price tag. I know that the Minister referred to the estimated additional expenditure of £100,000 in 1981-82 and of £300,000 in subsequent years, but this amendment has been tabled after that estimate was made. Therefore, that estimate is now irrelevant, unless the Government are hoping, expecting or insisting that the local authorities will cover this cost from their existing resources. If so, they are heaping additional burdens on the local education authorities, which is wholly unreasonable. I hope that the Minister will give us a specific answer to that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister presented the financial effects of the Bill in the resolution which we debated after Second Reading. He is now bringing out an amendment which would suggest an additional expenditure. We need to know whether this amendment requires additional expenditure or whether it is simply an attempt to make clearer the implications of the legislation.

My reply to both the hon Gentlemen who have been suggesting that this is a last-minute change of mind by the Government on expenses that in August 1980 the question was raised with me by COSLA. We have had ample time to consider the matter, including the figure that we have put in the financial memorandum.

I was on my feet, and that is where I intend to stay until I get a satisfactory answer to the question that I put. In the original Bill there is no provision such as is contained in the amendment.

We want, and we have a right to have, information on the estimated cost of the amendment and who is to foot the bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When COSLA was making representations the Government must have said who was to pay. Was the money to come out of the local authorities existing resources, or were the Government to foot the bill?
