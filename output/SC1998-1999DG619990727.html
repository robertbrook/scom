	<p>4.30 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(St. Ives)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the Food Safety (Fishery Products and Live Shellfish) (Hygiene) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1999 (S.I. 1999, No. 1585).</p></blockquote>
It is a great pleasure for me to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Wells.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have requested formal consideration of the instrument because the fishing industry is already so weighed down by red tape and regulation that it deserves to be taken into account before the regulations are approved. I want to speak about new schedule 4A, especially part II, in relation to hygiene inspection charges. The new schedule provides for the extension of a charge to the fishing industry for hygiene inspection in compliance with European Community directive 96/43.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following consultation by the joint food safety and standards group, the regulations implement the directive's provisions. On direct landings, the directive intends to make the first United Kingdom sale of directly landed fishery products a chargeable transaction and to require the vendor—a fishing vessel owner or agent—to submit written returns of landings for each accounting period for which the vendor will be charged. It is regrettable that the directive was not stopped in its tracks in Europe in 1996. The official Opposition will speak in the debate; perhaps they will explain why that did not happen. Apart from bivalve molluscs, fresh fish becomes objectionable before it becomes dangerous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not oppose appropriately recovering costs, but the directive adds bureaucracy, which is disproportionate to the charge that the Government seek to recover. Fishing vessel owners will have to provide evidence of their log book returns to local authorities as well as to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and producer organisations. Rather than employing existing industry structures, namely the Sea Fish Industry Authority, each vessel's owner or agent will be required to submit returns showing the total weight of landings to local authorities. The charge will be levied on that basis. The industry views that as farcical because the owner or agent can recover the charge from the first purchaser of the fish—the fish merchant or processor. Civil debt recovery is available to oblige recalcitrant purchasers to pay the charge, but fishermen believe that that means going along two sides of a triangle rather than directly approaching those required by the directive to pay the charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
The directive points out:
	<br><blockquote><p>"hygiene charges shall be collected at the time of first placing on the market unless already collected on landing and shall, in any event, be charged to the first purchaser."</p></blockquote>
The National Federation of Fishermen's Organisation believes that the Government have made the collection of the charge unnecessarily complicated and that it strays beyond the terms of the directive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Sea Fish Industry Authority levy is collected by people who purchase any fish on first-hand sale. It would have been far easier to have tacked the charges on to the system for collection of the sea fish levy, albeit that the levy and landing charges are payable to different authorities. The NFFO has told me—as well as the Minister and the Department of Health—that the Government could have used existing mechanisms and structures to make easier the administrative burden of the collection of the charge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of timing, I should tell the Committee that fishermen are also unhappy that the Government's detailed implementation legislation was promulgated only one week before the 1 July start date required by the directive. For vessel agents and owners, who will have to adapt software and invoicing procedures, that is a ridiculously short lead time, which has caused and will continue to cause disruption. The NFFO has written to the Minister, asking for the regulations to be introduced after a more reasonable period has elapsed. Will the Minister address the question of timing, and tell the Committee whether the introduction of the regulations could be delayed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Member states are obliged to collect the hygiene charge from the industry. The charge is set at 1 euro per tonne, which translates, according to the regulations, to 0.66p a tonne. However, a reducible element—fish that has been graded to EC size and freshness standards, as it usually is when landed at ports—is subject to a 55 per cent. rebate. That means that the charge for most white fish is about 31p per tonne. The issue is not so much the level of charge, which is currently moderate, as the cumbersome mechanism adopted for its collection and the fishing industry's concern that the charge will be increased at any time or ratcheted up in future years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The NFFO has stated that
	<br><blockquote><p>"what was proposed would apply another layer of unwelcome bureaucracy, was impracticable, inequitable in effect, and would generate the most strenuous resistance."</p></blockquote>
It went on to state that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"fundamental point was that many, perhaps the majority, of vessels will not pay this charge. Vessels of under 10 metres in length (68 per cent. of the fleet in number of vessels) have no legal obligation to complete or submit EC Logsheets. Government has only the most rudimentary means of checking landings from this class of vessel".</p></blockquote>
That approach involves a certain amount of fisherman-versus-fisherman activity, as fishermen with larger operations are concerned that they will feel no obligation or desire to meet the levy charge as it is not being imposed on smaller fishermen at the same rate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The NFFO has also stressed that the Department should consider closely experience of the recent extension of light dues and proposed changes in the under-12 m safety code, to judge the likely response of fishermen to a hygiene tax, albeit one that is set at 31p a tonne. The fishing industry put up a storm of protest about those two impositions, although the under-12 m safety code has been withdrawn and the Government are reflecting on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those examples give a flavour of the type of reception that hygiene charges might meet, even if such reactions are unprovoked. The NFFO claims that many vessels would simply choose not to submit returns unless they are forced to do so by court proceedings. Such an outcome would clearly be regrettable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not wish to get into the disagreement between fish merchants and fishing vessel owners about who is and who is not the first purchaser—there is some debate between the two about the interpretation of the regulations in that regard—but I urge the Minister to accept that the regulations as presently operated place a disproportionate burden on fishermen and that the lack of sufficient advance notice of their detailed content is unacceptable to the industry. It has suffered from a tremendous burden of red tape and regulation over recent years and, for many, this is the final straw.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is not persuaded by the weight of my arguments, I would urge her simply to withdraw the regulations to delay their implementation. In that way, she can at least allow fishermen an opportunity to establish proper software and invoicing mechanisms to cope with the regulations. Secondly, she could promise an early review of the bureaucratic impact of the charges and give a commitment to amend the regulations when she discovers their disproportionate impact on this country's fishermen.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.40 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mrs. Caroline Spelman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Meriden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Wells. I have every confidence that you will put me right. As the Member of Parliament for Meriden—the very middle of England—I am perhaps the least well placed geographically to speak about fishing. I shall perhaps need to prey in aid the help of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier), who, geographically speaking, is the nearest of my hon. Friends in Committee to the fishing industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative party is keen to place on record its concern about his measure, which is very unwelcome for the crisis-torn fish processing sector. It comes on top of other burdens that have been placed on the industry, such as cuts in quotas and water treatment charges. Those measures have brought many fishermen to a state of near despair. Indeed, Robert Milne, the secretary of the Scottish Fish Merchants Association Ltd. is on the record as saying that he sees in the Government
	<br><blockquote><p>"no willingness … to support the industry".</p></blockquote>
We want to emphasise the difficulties that that will cause the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
We understand that the purpose of the statutory instrument is to avoid the distortion of competition. Of course, we cannot, as the official Opposition, advocate a breach in compliance with the treaty of Rome. But—and there is a big but in practical terms—our experience of measures such as that before us is that other countries are less vigilant in applying them. Perhaps the Minister has evidence of the way in which other countries are approaching the enactment of this law, which technically came into force on 1 July. In particular, is there any evidence of how the Mediterranean fishing industry is applying the directive, given that there has been less willingness to obey the letter of the law in that part of the European Union than there has in our own waters? Is there any evidence of the practice, which is not unusual among our European partners, of bringing in compensatory measures when a common European directive forces additional charges on the industry? Is there any evidence of delays or reviews of the kind for which the hon. Member for St. Ives (Mr. George) called?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other cautionary tale that we have learned in dealing with such inspection measures is that we in this country are prone to a touch of gold-plating when it comes to their implementation. I urge the Minister to be on guard against that. Who will carry out the inspections, and what qualifications will the inspectors have? The Minister will recall that we recently debated the Food Standards Bill in Committee. One thing that the Minister of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said about people who were empowered to carry out inspections was that there was not always a level playing field in Europe. He said that the veterinary inspectors used for food standards inspections across the European Union were not always qualified vets. Will the relevant qualifications be uniform throughout the European Union?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also inconsistencies in the fish hygiene regulations when compared with the food hygiene regulations that we debated in the Food Standards Bill Committee. The Government decided not to place a food tax on the food processors in that case, whereas under these regulations a hygiene tax is clearly being placed on fish processors. What is the reason for such inconsistency?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One feature in the regulations that was absent, conversely, from the Food Standards Agency regulation, which provided for similar inspections, is the allowance for an appeals procedure. That is a welcome feature.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under part II of the regulations, the level of contribution towards the cost of hygiene inspection charges is set, as the hon. Member for St. Ives said, at 1 euro a tonne for the first 50 tonnes of fishery products. When I read that, I thought that the discretionary halving of the charges on more than 50 tonnes would put a disproportionate burden on smaller processors. Will the Minister clarify that point? We certainly do not want to enact a piece of legislation that pits one fisherman against another—that would be highly undesirable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall not oppose the regulations, because we cannot be seen to advocate something that would place us in breach of the treaty of Rome. However, we
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0281">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
draw the Minister's attention to the rather despairing cry of the Scottish fisherman who said of the introduction of these charges:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our politicians seem to be out of touch".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>4.46 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Public Health (Ms Tessa Jowell)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I join other Members in welcoming the opportunity to conduct this debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Wells.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I listened carefully to the speeches of the hon. Members for St. Ives and for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman). Like the constituents of the hon. Lady, my constituents in Dulwich and West Norwood buy fish rather than catch it. However, looking around the Committee, I see a number of hon. Members for whom the fishing industry is of enormous concern to the economic health of their constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall—I hope—deal with all the points that have been raised in this short debate. I should like to explain why the regulations are necessary and to highlight the careful attention that the Government have paid to the charges that this is an increased burden on an already stretched industry. I will speak about lead times and also about implementation by other countries. I assure the hon. Member for Meriden that the implementation of the directive in the United Kingdom does not in any way represent gold-plating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charges were introduced after careful consideration and full public consultation. The regulations came into force on 30 June. In summary, they implement charges for hygiene inspections of fishery products landed from European Union ships and hygiene inspections of fishery product establishments in Great Britain. Parallel regulations are to come into force in Northern Ireland on 9 August.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The charges for EU ships are similar to those which were implemented last year for hygiene inspections of fishery products landed by third country fishing, factory and freezer ships. As such, they serve to complete our obligations to implement the full set of charges relating to hygiene inspections on fishery products and fishery product establishments required under directive 96/43. The regulations also make some technical amendments to the Food Safety (Fishery Products and Live Shellfish) (Hygiene) Regulations 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should point out that fishery products are not being singled out when it comes to charging; hygiene inspections are already in place for food products of animal origin other than fish. For example, there are charges for hygiene inspection costs relating to the slaughter of beef, pigs, sheep and poultry, and for the cutting and storage of animal products.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the EU dimension and our legal responsibilities. These charges are required by European Council directive 96/43, which was agreed in June 1996 and introduced inspection charges for a range of food products of animal origin. Among other things, it requires standard charges to be collected to
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
contribute to the costs of carrying out hygiene inspections on fishery products and fishery products establishments. The underlying reason for the charges is to harmonise rules on charging for hygiene inspections, thus helping to provide a level playing field for the fish industry in different EU member states and to avoid any distortion of competition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the terms of the directive, all member states had a legal obligation to implement the charges by 1 July this year. As the hon. Member for Meriden made clear, had we not implemented the directive, the UK would have been in breach of its Community obligations and liable to legal challenge in the European Court. I understand that other member states are also proceeding to implement the provisions, according to their obligations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before drawing up the regulations, it was essential to consult interested parties on the arrangements for implementing the directive. I want to place on record the Government's thanks to the industry and the enforcement organisations, which made a constructive contribution to that process. I shall summarise the consultation. A letter was sent last summer to some 550 interested parties setting out the implementation timetable and explaining options for how the measures could be implemented. Meetings were held last autumn with representatives of trade bodies and enforcement authorities and a two-month formal consultation exercise followed between February and April this year. There were further meetings with the trade and enforcement bodies at the end of April to discuss responses to the consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, my officials attended a number of informal meetings with individual trade bodies, including the Sea Fish Industry Authority, the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, the UK Association of Frozen Food Producers, the British Frozen Food Federation and the Shellfish Association of Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main messages that we gleaned during that extensive consultation process were, first, that the industry was—not surprisingly—reluctant to pay the charges, although the legal obligation on the UK to introduce them was generally acknowledged. Secondly, different sectors of the industry had conflicting views on who should pay the charges at different stages. Thirdly, it was felt that there should be arrangements to help small businesses and food authorities, for whom there might have been a disproportionate administrative burden.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for St. Ives asked who should pay the charge. I am well aware that the fishermen's organisations feel that their members should not be required to pay a charge for the inspection of landed fish and that such a charge should instead be paid by the purchasers of the fish. We decided that fishermen or the agents who sell the fish on their behalf should pay the charge for several reasons. First, our legal advice was that that was the most appropriate way of implementing the directive's requirements. Secondly, the system that we have introduced allows for the collection and payment of charges by the smallest number of people, thereby minimising the administrative burden. Thirdly, a criterion for
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1998-1999V008P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
applying reductions to the charge is that the fish have been graded for freshness or size. That is the responsibility of the fishermen rather than the purchaser of the fish. The regulations provide that the charges that are paid by the fishermen should be included in the purchase price paid to them by the purchaser. In that way, the fishermen can recover the charges that they are required to pay.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The outcome of the consultation process is that the regulations are now in force. The charges that they introduce reflect the requirements of directive 96/43 and allow for: charges on landings of fresh fish and frozen and processed fishery products from EU fishing, factory and freezer vessels; a charge for fishery products entering establishments in which fishery products are processed; a charge for inspections of establishments in which fishery products are stored, chilled, frozen and/or packaged; and a charge for inspecting UK approved factory vessels that are inspected abroad.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that EU law made it impossible for us to do anything other than implement the charges, we have taken every available step to ensure that the charges are equitable and fairly spread across the industry. That means that fishermen, fish processors and those in the industry who prepare, freeze, chill, pack or simply store products will all make a contribution to the inspection costs. However, that contribution will be modest, as I shall explain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We took several important steps to reduce the costs and burdens on the industry, especially small businesses and food authorities. I shall give some examples of the provisions that we have made. First, landings of fishery products of less than 1 tonne—about 2,000 lbs, for hon. Members who are more familiar with that system—will not require a charge to be paid. That should mean that the majority of fishermen operating small fishing vessels will not have to pay charges. Secondly, charges can be paid in flexible account periods, to be agreed with local food authorities, of between one month and one year. That reflects our wish to minimise the administrative burden on fishermen. It will reduce the frequency of making returns and payments to local food authorities, thus minimising administrative costs. Thirdly, reductions to the standard charge will be applied to the majority of businesses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal briefly with the costs to the industry. The main charges are set at a level of 1 euro, or 67p, per tonne of fishery product landed, and 1 euro per tonne of fishery product entering processing establishments. Those charges can be reduced by 55 per cent. to about 30p per tonne if certain conditions are met. Our expectation—and, indeed, the official guidance from my Department to local food authorities—is that the reduced level of charge should apply in the majority of cases. Consequently, the typical charge for a tonne of landed fresh fish, which may have a commercial value of £1,500, would be about 30p.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Industry-wide, we estimate that the new charge will create recurring costs of approximately £650,000 per annum. That income will go to the inspecting local authorities. In response to the point that was raised by
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
the hon. Member for Meriden, the inspections will be carried out by environmental health officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A typical small processing business that was contacted as part of the regulatory impact assessment estimated that it would pay charges of between £75 and £165 a year—between approximately £1.50 and £3 a week. In taking forward our proposals to implement the charges, a full regulatory impact assessment was carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, for several reasons, that members of the Committee will accept the measure. First, the charges are unavoidable if we are to discharge our obligations under Community law. Secondly, we have carried out full consultation with interested parties and have taken many comments on board. Thirdly, fishing has not been singled out for hygiene inspection charges: the charges parallel those already in place for third country fishery products and other animal products. Fourthly, as with any new regulation, I expect that practical issues are likely to arise from making the charges work at a local level. I know that local authorities and the trade are already working together on the issue. The Department of Health is available to provide whatever further advice may be necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have approached the implementation of the regulations fairly and openly, and in a way that meets our EU obligations. I hope that, in the light of my detailed presentation of the background of the issue, hon. Members will feel able to support the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew George</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply certainly helps to clarify the matter and to confirm my interpretation of the purpose of the charge. There has been significant consultation with all aspects of the industry. I had not intended to imply that that had not occurred; I know that there was much consultation. I reassure the Minister that I did not wish to suggest that the fishing industry had been singled out for hygiene charges. I am aware that hygiene inspection charges apply equally to other industries. I also accept, as I noted clearly in my initial remarks, that the charges are modest relative to the value of the fish landed. My point, which the Minister perhaps did not consider, concerned not that value but the red tape and bureaucracy that must be put in place in order to collect the charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I dealt with that point. The proposal for a flexible period of returns—anything between one month and one year—was agreed specifically to minimise the administrative and bureaucratic costs, especially those on the fishing industry.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I heard the Minister; her comment was reassuring and I considered that point. However, fishermen must still recover those charges; they must institute their own computer systems and invoicing arrangements, and I shall come on to talk about them. They had a problem getting those charging and invoicing systems in place because of the length of notice that they received. A flexible accounting period, in which charges may be recovered by local authorities, will unquestionably be of benefit, and I am sure that the industry welcomes that.

	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
Many of the charges and regulations affecting the industry are justifiable in their own way. However, the Minister must recognise that, incrementally—as the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the European Commission pile one charge or regulation on top of another—an administrative burden is placed on small fishing boat owners and on the people working on those boats. When a further burden is placed on them, the problem is not so much the charge but the red tape that they face. With that new charge comes the implication not only of paying the local authority but of having to recover the charge from the first purchaser, which might be difficult. It would be helpful if the Minister recognised that that could be a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recognise that local authorities are engaged with the fishing industry in helping to iron out the teething problems of the charges as they are being implemented this month. Will the Minister respond to my request for an early review by her Department of the impact of the charges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Brand</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that we are not worried about the impact of the charges on boats of fewer than 34 ft long or which catch fewer than 2,000 lbs of fish, and that we are not worried about factory ships that carry out all their processing at sea? Our concern is with vessels in between, which, traditionally, have used wholesalers for much of their administrative work. Is my hon. Friend aware of negotiations in other European countries and whether the charges can be passed on to the purchaser of fish from smaller vessels? That would make more sense.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend; the Minister may wish to respond to his question because I am not aware of what arrangements have been made in other European Union countries for recovery of the charges. My hon. Friend is correct in saying that the issue is not from whom the charges will be recovered. The Minister said that there is some dispute between fish merchants and fishermen about who should be defined as the first purchaser under the regulations. Fishermen are making the case that they should not be considered to be the first purchaser. The issue is how the charges will be implemented. My hon. Friend is correct in saying that excessively large trawlers and small inshore vessels will be largely immune from the regulations, but that trawlers of more than 10 m will be disproportionately affected, I urge the Minister again to respond to my request for a promise that the Department will review the bureaucratic impact of the charges.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Ms Jowell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only way of responding to that point is to intervene, It is important to recognise that the regulations have been in the pipeline for two years since the directive was agreed and that the fishing industry was well aware of what would be needed as a result of the consultation. We have given clear encouragement to local authorities to be flexible and to enable businesses to get up to speed in completing returns. The evidence is that there appear to have been very few problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be unreasonable not to be prepared to keep the operation of the directive under review and to use the links between the Department and the industry to do so. If further guidance and/or advice is necessary, we shall provide it, and any intractable problems will be raised with the appropriate authorities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the right hon. Lady that interventions should be brief and to the point. The Minister and every other hon. Member has the opportunity to speak in the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the Minister's intervention and I welcome her Department's monitoring of the impact of the charges on fishing vessels. Although she reassured me that that there have been few teething problems, I know that many fishermen are anxious. A new administrative procedure has been established to collect from the industry what is, with regard to hygiene inspection charges, postage-stamp charge, even though charge recovery mechanisms are already in place. I appreciate that the fishing industry was consulted, but it was not fully aware of the contents of the regulations until one week before their implementation, which I thought was to be 1 July. I now realise that they came into force one day earlier on 30 June, which is even worse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations place a tremendous administrative burden on extremely small companies. Many fishing boats are owned by the skipper or a family. Few are part of very large fleets. I hope that the Minister will consider the impact of delaying the implementation of the regulations and of the short notice that was given. I also hope that she will guarantee that the effect of the bureaucratic burden will be reviewed and that, instead of inflicting an additional administrative burden on the industry, the use of existing charge-recovery mechanisms, such those administered by the Sea Fish Industry Authority, will be considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
