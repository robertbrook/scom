	<p>10.30 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Law Officers' Department (Mr. Arthur Davidson)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the Legal Aid (Financial Conditions) Regulations 1979.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be for the convenience of the Committee if we also take the following:
Legal Advice and Assistance (Financial Condition (No. 2) Regulations 1979.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is good to be able to come to a Committee with some good news, and I do have some good news today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The election date?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It is good news of a different sort.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These regulations are part of the package of improvements in the financial conditions for civil legal aid and advice and assistance generally which, as the Committee will know, were announced by my noble Friend, the Lord Chancellor, in November last year, and of which he gave details in another place when moving the Second Reading of the Legal Aid Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations increase the lower disposable income limit—that is, the limit above which legal aid ceases to be free— from a disposable income of £815, which it is now, to a disposable income of £1,500. The term "disposable" means the income which is left after deductions have been made for tax, rent or mortgage, other necessary expenses such as travelling to work, and allowances for dependants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regulations also increase the upper income limit, above which one ceases to be eligible for legal aid, from a disposable income of £2,600, which it is now, to £3,600. The lower capital limit—the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
amount an applicant is entitled to keep —is increased from the present limit of £365 to £1,200, and the upper limit, above which an applicant will not normally be entitled to legal aid, is increased from the present figure of £1,700 to £2,500.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Legal Advice and Assistance (Financial Conditions) (No. 2) Regulations relate to legal advice and assistance under what is commonly known as the green form scheme, and they increase the eligibility limits for legal advice and assistance from a disposable income of £52 a week, which it is now, to £75 a week, and from a disposable capital of £365 to £600. Other regulations, which do not require an affirmative resolution, increase the lower free disposable income limit from the present limit of £25 to £35 a week, and make consequential amendments to the scale of contributions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In assessing a person's disposable income, allowances are made for dependants, which for this purpose include a spouse. At present, these allowances correspond to supplementary benefit rates, but further regulations, which again do not require an affirmative resolution, will increase these allowances for legal aid and legal advice and assistance so that they will be 50 per cent, above the appropriate supplementary benefit rates for the particular dependant. This will be of considerable help to families. In fact, families will benefit most of all from this package.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The opportunity has also been taken to simplify the regulations relating to the assessment of resources by incorporating some allowances in the scale and adjusting others. The simplification should in many cases remove the necessity for interviews at legal aid assessment offices. Anyone who has dealt with legal aid will know that these interviews are long, laborious and costly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Time and again, in Committee and in debates on legal aid, estimates have been made about the proportion of the population that is at present eligible for legal aid. It is difficult to make accurate assessments because the limits relate to disposable income, which varies according to a person's commitments and family.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, one thing is clear—namely, that far fewer people are now within the scope of the scheme than when it was first introduced in 1950. The increases which are made by these regulations, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0376">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
the others to which I have referred, will, I am happy to say, recover that lost ground. As a result of the regulations, and of the Bill which is now before another place, to which I shall refer briefly later, it is hoped that over 70 per cent, of the population will be eligible for legal aid, and that over 30 per cent, of households consisting of two parents and two children will not be required to pay a contribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn briefly to contributions towards the cost of civil legal aid. As I said earlier, a Bill is at present before another place that will enable the Lord Chancellor to reduce the maximum contribution payable by persons whose disposable income is above the free limit. This is an important move because there is little point in granting people legal aid if they cannot afford to pay the contribution. It is hoped that the Bill will come before this House at the earliest possible opportunity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman is leaving the question of proportions, did I understand him to say that, after these changes are made, 70 per cent, of the population would be eligible for legal aid? If that is what he said, has that been worked out on a basis comparable to the previous estimates of proportion that we have had, or on some new basis? I do not remember at any time hearing that the proportion was as high as 70 per cent, or anything like it. I thought that 40 per cent, was the highest figure of which I had heard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How do the limits, about which he has already told the Committee, compare, after allowing for changes in the value of money, with the limits when the scheme was first introduced and with the limits that existed in 1974? We need those figures, as well as the proportions, to see what substantial difference the regulations are making. If the hon. Gentleman can give us those figures before he sits down, we can deal with them when we come to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister confirm that, when the legal aid scheme first began, more than 70 per cent, of the population were eligible, and not fewer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Southport
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
(Mr. Percival) for giving me a little notice so that I can give him the best answer available. I can assure him that the figures that I gave are accurate. Indeed, my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor quoted the same figure in the other place. Perhaps more than 70 per cent, of the population will be eligible for legal aid. Perhaps later I shall be able to give my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) an answer to his questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, I think the Committee will agree that these regulations, together with the others to which I have referred, and the Legal Aid Bill, constitute the most significant and important improvement in the legal aid scheme since it was introduced. I am sure that it will be welcomed by the Committee. For a long time it has been a source of irritation and concern that such a high percentage of people, many of whom are on fairly modest incomes, were ineligible for legal aid. These regulations will recitfy that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.42 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the Minister will be able to give the Committee those figures before we finish our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is one other matter. I am surprised that the Minister has given no estimate of the cost of these changes. The same reason has been given year in and year out by the Labour Government for not doing so. I should have thought that the first figure he would give us would be how much this scheme would cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figure is £6 million, but at an earlier discussion when we were considering the usual uprating of legal aid, I foreshadowed this vast improvement and quoted the figure of £6 million. That figure has been given by my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor. I apologise if I did not give that figure this morning. The hon. and learned Gentleman was right to ask for it as it is an important figure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very much obliged. Perhaps the Minister could later give the dates on which he and his colleagues referred to this figure. I can then see how it is composed. At present I find it a little difficult to add up the two figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understood that it was common ground that the proportion now entitled to legal aid was going down from the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0377">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
outset, and is now very low. I do not know whether the Minister can tell us what the proportion now eligible for legal aid is thought to be. The only way we can measure the effectiveness of this scheme is by having two figures—the proportion that is now thought to be eligible and the proportion that it is thought will be eligible after the changes are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that we are making changes that will be of advantage to people faced with litigation. I welcome those changes. The Opposition have been pressing for them for some time. I hope that we can get a little nearer to knowing exactly what the changes are. I do not necessarily want to know the figures this morning, but I hope that the Minister will let us have them as soon as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we also have the figures that I mentioned, having regard to the fall in the value of money between the time when the scheme was first introduced and now? Have we got back to the limits at which we started, or are we still below those limits? If we are still below them, while it is a matter for congratulation that after these come into operation there will be more legal aid available than before they came into operation, we must not congratulate ourselves too much if we are still appreciably below the limits which were provided when the schemes first came into operation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Could the Minister, in addition, say how the limits which will be prescribed when these regulations take effect compare, after allowing for the fall in the value of money, with the limits which prevailed at the time when this Government came into office? Only then can we see how much anybody is to be congratulated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise one other matter—and if the Minister's officials can assist him before we finish our business, so much the better. If that is not the case, perhaps he could give a reply afterwards. I would expect that when changes such as this—which we believe to be significant—are made, there would be detailed discussion with the Law Society. We on this side would like to know whether these regulations have been agreed with the Law Society, and whether there were differences between the Law Society and
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
the Government on any particular detail. I am not saying necessarily that the view of the Law Society should prevail or indeed that the view of the Government should prevail. But it would help us to know whether there have been discussions, whether there were any major differences—or indeed any significant differences—and, if so, which view has prevailed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put those requests for information at the outset, for obvious reasons. I shall now comment on the regulations. Of course we welcome them. There is no doubt that the position of litigants will be better after these regulations come into effect than it was before. This is a step which should have been taken long ago. For a long time there has been a very big gap. Many people have found it impossible to engage in litigation, even if they had a good claim,—and, if they were defending a claim brought against them, it was extremely difficult—because they were above the limit prescribed by the regulations. They were, therefore, theoretically able to pay for their own representation. But in fact they were not in a position to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why we have been pressing for some time—and not only from this side; there has been pressure and resolute promises from other quarters as well—for a revision of these limits. We have always been put off with the answer, "Yes we agree that it should be done, but we cannot afford it". It is a little surprising that that having been the argument for so long, that this should be the moment chosen to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would probably be considered ungenerous of me if I were to say that it is very unlikely that the Government will have to find the money to pay for it. More than likely, by the time these regulations become effective, and the burden falls upon the Exchequer, there will be another Chancellor of the Exchequer and another Government which will be responsible for finding the money. Although it is not every burden that will be bequeathed to a Conservative Government by the Labour Government which will meet with our ready approval, this is one which—if we were placed in that position—we would readily accept, because we think it does no more than remedy an injustice that has existed for far too long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0378">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I find a little surprising the figure of £6 million. I should perhaps have made that statement at the outset to give the Minister more time to deal with it. If the proportion is rising significantly, I find it difficult to believe that the cost will be only £6 million. If the Minister in replying can enlarge on that matter, so be it. If he cannot do so, will he please let us have some more information about it?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those qualifications, I welcome the regulations on behalf of the Opposition. We shall be glad to see them come into operation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>10.51 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a minor way, this is an occasion for parliamentary and public rejoicing. The Labour Benches, the Law Society and, I presume, the Bar Council, too, have constantly reiterated that the legal aid limits should be raised and that more money should be made available so that ordinary people might have recourse to the courts when they suffered accidents, for example, and needed assistance. At a time of difficulties over public expenditure, the Government have allocated £6 million., to this end. We have not arrived at this point overnight; the money has been in the pipeline for some time. I suspect that the Lord Chancellor has had to fight in the Cabinet to obtain this allocation. It is an indication of the Government's priorities that they have found the money for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On occasions such as this the Opposition never talk about cutting public expenditure. Many questions have been addressed this morning by the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Per-cival) to my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Secretary. I should like to ask what chance there is that, if a Conservative Government were to be returned to office in the near future, they would adhere to the grant of £6 million. Will the hon. and learned Gentleman give an undertaking that that money will still be allocated to that purpose? Will he also give an undertaking that there will be further increases in the period of inflation which would undoubtedly result from the return of a Conservative Government, so that the increase will retain its value?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If one had suspected that there was a little bit of electioneering
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
behind this measure, that speech might have confirmed one's suspicions. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that I cannot give any undertakings. It cannot have escaped his notice that I went as far as any Opposition spokesman in a Committee could conceivably go by saying that this was one of the burdens which we would accept when returned to office. Does not the hon. and learned Gentleman consider it mischievous to say what he has said? Could he not recognise the assurance I have given?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listen to the hon. and learned Gentleman with awe, because he has so quickly forgotten the atmosphere of his own remarks. It was he who referred to the question of the next Government, and it was he who suggested that this allocation of money might somehow have some connection with that question. I suspect that he well knows that it has nothing to do with the question of the forthcoming election or the question which Government will have to find the resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This matter has been under discussion for a very long time. The Law Society, which represents the solicitors of this country—although there are no solicitors present on the Committee this morning —has in the past circulated Members of Parliament with its demands for an improvement of the kind about which we have heard about this morning. This is nothing new. Nobody would suggest that the Law Society is peopled by Labour voters. Indeed, I suspect that one would have difficulty in finding any Labour voters in the Law Society. Therefore, the Law Society ought to be pleased by the announcement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Bradford the announcement will be especially welcome, as the law centre that was to have been provided under the comprehensive community programme for Bradford has been refused by the local Conservative council. Therefore, it is more important than ever that people without much in the way of resources, or without any resources, should have the possibility of taking legal advice and obtaining legal help. These regulations, together with the splendid work of the citizens advice bureau in Bradford, should help to fill some of the gap left by the refusal of a law centre that was offered to the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0379">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I am sorry to bedevil the Minister with yet more questions, but I should like to know what proportion of expenditure on civil legal aid the figure of £6 million will amount to. I apprehend that the regulations apply only to civil as opposed to criminal legal aid, but I may be wrong. I hope that that matter can be clarified. In other words, by what percentage are we increasing, say, the sums allocated last year for civil legal aid?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How, if at all, are the resources of criminal legal aid affected by this instrument? If they are not affected by it, are there any proposals for further allocation of resources for criminal legal aid, in the light of the continued pressures on the courts, the increasing waiting lists in the courts, and the expense of providing proper defences? Will the regulations take effect from the moment they are passed?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the people of Accrington know what the Parliamentary Secretary has done this morning, he will be a hero in Accrington. In areas such as Accrington and Bradford, this sort of assistance will be most welcome and useful. When I think of the plight of textile workers in Bradford who may sustain accidents and require legal assistance to obtain proper redress, I can only be gladdened by the existence of these negotiations. I congratulate the Government on their efforts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.0 a.m.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I introduced these regulations this morning, I thought that I did so in flat, non-controversial and low-key style, as befits a Statutory Instruments Committee. With the greatest respect to the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival), of whom I am very fond, it was he who introduced a political element into the discussion. It was he who related it to the possibility of a future election, and even to the possibility of a change of Government. He really cannot then criticise my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) for taking him up on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With great respect to the hon. and learned Gentleman—and to his hon. and learned colleague the Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Mayhew)—I should have thought that their welcome for this

very distinct improvement, an enormous improvement for which everyone has been asking, would have been much more fulsome than it was. Perhaps the fact that the hon. and learned Gentleman was not quite so fulsome in his praise is related to the so-called coming election. But I do not know whether it is coming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to cross swords with the hon. and learned Gentleman because he and I have known each other for a long time, but I hope that he will bear one thing in mind. Whether it is an enormous improvement or just catching up rather belatedly depends upon the answers to some more information on which I have not pressed the hon. and learned Gentleman today, because I do not expect him to have every detail to hand. He should bear in mind that at least the major part of my reason for preparing for a possible change of Government was to give the greatest assurance I could on behalf of the Opposition. As the Committee will know, I could not possibly go as far as his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons) wanted me to go in giving an undertaking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that we should get back to the regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I should more than welcome that. This Committee this morning is almost a lawyers paradise. I hope that we can get on with the substance of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman asked about the £6 million. That figure was given by my noble Friend in another place last year. I quoted the figure at a sitting of a Statutory Instruments Committee when we were dealing with the normal uprating. The figure is now—to repeat my hon. and learned Friends phrase—common knowledge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The restrictions on legal aid for undefended divorce, which my noble Friend introduced, made it cheaper to increase the limits. If it had not been restricted, legal aid limits could not have been increased. So the savings made by the restriction on legal aid for undefended divorce, together with, of course my noble Friend's dedication to improving the limits, has enabled this increase to be made.

	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
The hon. and learned Gentleman asked whether we had got back to the limits at which the legal aid scheme started—by which I take it that he meant the same number of people being eligible for legal aid as would have been eligible in 1950. In 1950, it was estimated that the eligibility figure was about 80 per cent. I have quoted a figure of 70 per cent, of the population which will now be eligible. In fact, it may well be more than 70 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In quoting that figure, I am erring on the cautious side. I hope that that information will assist the hon. and learned Gentleman. It is difficult to be precise, because there are no consistent statistics. In talking about population, of course, one is also talking, on one hand of pensioners, and on the other, of young people. It is not easy to quote an accurate figure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is certainly true is that as a result of these regulations more people with families will be eligible. Here I know that we can dismiss party politics. I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman will approve of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman asked whether there had been full discussions with the Law Society. I can assure him that there have been such discussions. There are no major differences between the Law Society figures and the figures that my noble Friend has approved in these regulations. As I understand, the regulations are in fact slightly more generous than the sums asked for by the Law Society. I assure the hon. and learned Gentleman that there have been the fullest discussions with the Law Society, which is happy about the regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Southport asked about the proportion of the population eligible for legal aid. I told him that it is difficult to give an accurate assessment. In the 26th annual report, 1975–76, there was a summary by a special consultant who was appointed by my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor to study financial eligibility. For the enlightenment of the hon. and learned Gentleman, perhaps I can tell him one of the findings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between 1964 and 1974, the estimated proportion of the households with children studied—predominantly where one or both parents were in work, eligible for legal aid declined from 64 per cent, to 23 per cent. Only an insignificant proportion of such households were eligible for
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
free legal aid. Percentages for eligible couples with no children are higher because the figures include many households containing persons over retirement age with little or no earned income. The hon. and learned Gentleman will appreciate that, as a result of these regulations, a vast number of people, certainly those with families, who were previously ineligible, or who could not previously afford the contributions, will now be able to obtain legal aid. That is, by any standards, a considerable advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bradford, West asked whether this applied purely to civil legal aid. It does. It does not affect criminal legal aid at all. The date from which these regulations take effect is 6 April.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Mayhew</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am trying to follow the statistics, which the Minister will agree are important. He said that 80 per cent, is the estimate of the proportion of the population that will be eligible for legal aid once these regulations take effect. If that is the case, it is a very satisfactory percentage. But I do not understand why he is unable to give the similar figure for comparative purposes today. The figures that he has given are for 1964–1974. The proportion of households with children is a different basis for comparison from that for which he has given 80 per cent, as the figure from the date of aplication of these regulations and their coming into force. Can the Minister give the percentage of population as a whole that can best be estimated as being eligible today?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful to the hon. and learned Gentleman. Perhaps I can write to him to give a more accurate figure than I could give at this moment. The estimate as a result of these regulations is that more than 70 per cent, of the population will be eligible. I shall give him as accurate information as I can about the present figure. It is difficult to assess exactly what the figure is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells mentioned that I had quoted figures up to 1974. Because of the annual uprating, those figures would apply today; they have been held. Of course I accept that we were not talking about households, but it does

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
give him some indication as to the position. Certainly, since 1974 there has not been a decline. That position has held.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for that last fact, which I acknowledge. The hon. Gentleman said that the position was a lawyer's paradise. It is a lawyer's paradise so far, in the sense that nobody except a lawyer has spoken. But I am sure that all the lawyers who have spoken would say that they welcome non-lawyers speaking. In fact, we have not yet referred to a single matter of law. There is no law in this order. The simple question is its effect on laymen, not lawyers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Edmund Marshall</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a non-lawyer, I follow the invitation of the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival), although I feel like a stranger in this paradise. I should like to take this opportunity, as a non-lawyer, to emphasise how much I welcome this measure, not because it will benefit lawyers, but because it will greatly benefit the general public.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that what I was saying emphasised that. But it will indirectly affect lawyers because of the amount of money that is available for fees. All our debate has been about the effect on laymen. That is our concern on this side of the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Edward Lyons</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would it not be more correct to say hat the lawyer Members who contributed to this debate have made a successful impersonation of lay Members, and perhaps that is not so great after all?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I still wish more lay Members had spoken, because this is a matter of great importance for laymen. On a matter such as this people are horribly technical and legal, and therefore the laymen do not speak. I, therefore, lose no opportunity to encourage laymen to enter into these debates. I am sure that other hon. Members take the same view.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me clarify the situation. It is clear that more people will be eligible for legal aid after these regulations come into effect than before. There will be more people who will pay a smaller contribution than before. That is a matter for wel-
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
come. From this side, there is an unqualified welcome. The question then arises of how much further one can go. We would like to know whether a vast number of people will benefit, whether it is a matter for adjustment, whether it is an enormous improvement. That does not seem to be too much to ask.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not press the hon. Gentleman for the figure because he has said that he does not have it at the moment. But we have an 80 per cent, figure for 1950 of the proportion of the population who were eligible. We have an estimate now that, after this, something over 70 per cent, will be eligible. Why, then, is it not possible to have some sort of estimate— and I appreciate the difficulty—of the proportion who are now eligible? When we have that figure we can see whether it is an enomous improvement, or just an improvement, and what proportion of people will benefit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It ill behoves any of us, on either side of the Committee, to go further than to say that we welcome the increase—to say, for example, that a vast number of people who at the moment do not qualify will qualify—unless it is first demonstrated to us that it is true. If the number of people who will qualify and who do not qualify now is a fairly modest one, the one message that must not go out of this Committee is that a vast number of people will be assisted who are not assisted now. That is my purpose in asking these questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I repeat that I would rather have a considered figure. I am not trying to make a point about the figure not being available here. I understand the difficulties. What I am asking for is—either now, if it is available, but making no criticism that it is not available, or at some future moment—that this estimate should be given of the proportion of people who are currently entitled to legal aid. I end where I started. These regulations are an improvement and, as such, we welcome them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Arthur Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can assist the hon. and learned Member for Southport (Mr. Percival) a little further, because I take his point. He frequently asks—in other Committees, too—for information, and he always gives Ministers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1978-1979V004P0I0382">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
time to reply. I know that he prefers a considered reply to a half-considered reply—if I may use that phrase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that, between 1964 and 1974, the estimated proportion of those households with children eligible for legal aid declined from 64 per cent, to 23 per cent. I said later that that figure had been held. So the best figure I can give for households is that only about 23 per cent, of the population is now eligible for legal aid. In fact, households are a more important guide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The population as a whole includes large numbers of pensioners and young people who are on low incomes. Householders are more important as a guide because they are generally on higher incomes with higher commitments. So perhaps for the present the hon. and learned Gentleman will accept the fact that about 23 per cent, of the population is now eligible for legal aid. It may be a little more; it may be a little less. But, certainly, it is nowhere near 70 per cent., which is the estimated figure that will benefit as a result of these regulations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Percival</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. Of course I accept it as the best figure that can be given for the moment. But I ask him to realise that I find it a little difficult to relate the fact that one can go from 23 per cent, to 70 per cent, with £6 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Davidson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. and learned Gentleman an assurance that I shall give him as much information as I possibly can as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
