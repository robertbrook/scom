	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee have considered the matter of Tourism in Scotland.</p></blockquote>
Hon. Members will need no reminding of the part which tourism can play in the social and economic life of Scotland. Although the rôle of tourism in the economy is under study by the Scottish Economic Planning Board, it is already clear that the industry offers one of the most hopeful prospects for the development of large areas of Scotland. It is, of course, a notable foreign exchange earner and foreign exchange saver and so ranks high in the export drive. At a time when we are facing a balance-of-trade problem of such severity, this must obviously be a point of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tourism is one of the growth industries of the world. We must improve our position in this fiercely competitive international market. We must pay attention to the need for planning and investment, the prerequisites of expansion in modern industry. Hon. Members will remember that when we came to office in October the Government were presented with a number of problems, of which tourism was certainly high on the agenda. It has been a long and searching analysis which we have gone about in trying to secure what was the right thing to do. One of the important things, particularly in present economic difficulties, was to decide where and how much we could spend on particular enterprises. That is why we recognised the need for research
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For all its importance, we still do not know enough about the exact ways in which tourism makes its impact upon the economy. We do not really know what our capacity is and how our potential could be most effectively developed. The facts are still guesswork. We are determined to put an end to this hit-or-
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
miss approach. We cannot, for example, make a really informed drive to attract capital investment on the scale which is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the main obstacles facing the Scottish Economic Planning Board in assessing the actual and potential rôle of tourism in the economy is the need for reliable data. Recently the Board commissioned an economist from Glasgow University to carry out a preliminary reconnaissance. This has confirmed the urgent need for research. The day of the amateur approach to tourism is past. This is the age of the research team, of management techniques, of data processing and of computers It is an age when every effort is made to take the unnecessary guesswork out of decisions. Our international competitors are very well aware of the importance of know-how in service industries as well as in technology and have applied research with great effect in tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It requires only a cursory examination of the statistics published on tourism in Scotland to show that they cannot be relied upon even to indicate trends. Indeed, they do not square with the Tourist Board's own assessment of the progress of the industry or with a number of independent indications which we have. The Board's Report for 1962, for example, described tourism as Scotland's fastest growing industry, although the figures which it published of numbers of persons accommodated in hotels, boarding houses and apartments for that year showed a substantial fall compared with 1961. In its Report for 1963, the Board again reported a continuation of the expansion of the industry—and again, in 1964, another year of progress. In spite of this, the pessimists, relying on the statistics published by the Board, say that the industry is stagnant or in decline.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Economic Planning Board has already given some attention to this problem, and provisional calculations, based on statistics collected from a wide variety of sources by a consultant economist carrying out researches for the Board, suggest that expenditure expanded by 9 per cent. in 1962, by 11 per cent. in 1963, and probably by a considerably greater percentage in 1964. The lessons of all this are that pessimism about the prospects of the industry is not well founded, and that it is of first importance
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0407">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
to get as reliable data as we can about one of our main industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was against this background that Ministers had to take a decision on the Scottish Tourist Board's request for a renewal of the £15,000 grant, which was first given in 1959 for a period of three years, later extended to six years, and was to be spent on the development of tourism in the Highlands. Bearing in mind that in future the Highland Development Board would be able to give special help to the Highlands in various ways, Ministers came to the conclusion that something more positive than a simple extension of the temporary grant was required, something more closely directed to the present needs of Scotland as a whole. The answer clearly lay in money which would be spent in generating more money; in a word, on research.

While Ministers were developing their thoughts on this, the Scottish Tourist Board was itself making a fundamental re-appraisal of its position. It decided that although the original conception of a lay board had served it well, the time had come for a constitution more directed to present-day needs. Accordingly, the Chairman, Lord Rosebery, and the Vice-Chairman, Sir Alexander King, put proposals to the Secretary of State for a fundamental re-organisation of the Board, designed, by providing for direct representation of the main sections of the tourist industry, to make it more professional and generally better equipped. The Board is confident that this reorganisation will result in a much larger measure of financial support from all sections of the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lord Rosebery has now advised the Secretary of State that reorganisation on the lines which they discussed has been approved in principle by the Board and is going ahead. The Secretary of State has told the Chairman that he welcomes this forward-looking decision and that he will be happy to offer the new Board a grant-in-aid of up to £75,000 for an agreed programme of research to be spread over three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to express the Secretary of State's warm appreciation of the contribution which the Board has made over the years to the cause of tourism in Scotland and his gratitude to individual members
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
for their several contributions; not least for their acceptance of the need for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the opportunity of apologising to the Committee for the fact that hon. Members have read some of this information in one of the newspapers. I assure the Committee, on behalf of my right hon. Friend, that neither the Government nor any of the officials who serve the Government are in any way responsible for this. It will be for the Chairman of the Board to announce the details of the reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No doubt the Committee will meantime be interested in the items which the Secretary of State and the Board think might be included in the new research programme, which it is hoped will provide a basis for assessing the extent to which the industry in Scotland needs to be developed if it is to play its full part in the social and economic life of the country. It will not all be backroom study. The Board will be able to try out some of its ideas in pilot schemes and to sponsor market research.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Better statistics on volume and value are required, on occupancy rates, on investment return. Where practicable these should be collected on a basis which will make for ready international comparison and contact will be made as necessary with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The matter has exercised me yesterday and today. I am satisfied, and so is the Secretary of State, that the words which I have used are absolutely correct in absolving the Ministers and officials concerned in the Scottish Office. That is as far as I can go. I know how the Committee feels about these things, and I hope that those responsible will take note of what is said in this Committee this morning both by myself on behalf of the Government and by individual hon. Members. It does not make life any better for us in the work which we do for Scotland that we have incidents like this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all this it will be important to keep in close touch with others engaged in research in the British Isles, notably the British Travel Association. We want to discover the patterns of changes in leisure and trends in personal expenditure and what significance they have for us. The dilemma for tourism in Scotland is that the season is too short to attract major investment and that only major investment is likely substantially to extend the season. Winter sports have proved a most effective way of extending the season, but we must not think that this is the only way of doing so and we intend to see what help research can give us in tackling this whole problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will no doubt know that the Government, indeed previous Governments, have been attacked for not providing substantial sums of money for the extension of the tourist industry. I appeal to the Committee to reflect that it must decide before joining in such attacks whether it believes that tourism, like agriculture, should be heavily subsidised by the Treasury. If they believe this, it is a point of principle that the Government should give certain assistance, which I shall describe, and should give it in certain specific and effective
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
ways. This is the option which the Government have taken in this matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to another aspect in which the Government are being helpful in this regard—planning for tourism by local authorities. There was little systematic planning for tourism until, after two large-scale conferences on tourism convened at Braemar and Edinburgh by the Town Planning Institute and the Scottish Tourist Board, the Scottish Development Department issued its now celebrated Circular No. 2 of 1962. This recognised the increasing demands that would be made on the countryside by the growth of tourism and the needs of our own people for open-air recreation. It emphasised the importance of ensuring that in catering for these we did not encourage or indeed allow offensive development. Accordingly, the circular asked local planning authorities both to identify areas of great landscape value and to make plans for tourist provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Basic planning of this kind is of the first importance. Without it, effort becomes fragmented; resources can be easily dissipated or actual harm can be done. A tourist plan is as important as an industrial plan in its own field: it is, in effect, notice to potential developers of the kinds of investment which will be encouraged and of how development can be expected to fit into its environment. In this very competitive field authorities cannot hope to attract investment unless they have their prospectus ready.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only two of these plans out of a possible 57 have so far been formally presented and a few more are coming up to the finishing line. From what we have seen of these they are quite first-class, and they have demonstrated beyond any doubt the value of the exercise when it is well carried out. We appreciate the difficulties facing local authorities, in particular the shortages of technical staff. Nevertheless, progress has been disappointing. It is vitally important that more progress should be made and made quickly. I appeal to each hon. Member to consider how best he might encourage his local planning authorities in his constituency to push ahead with this proposal more speedily. Suggestions have been made to local authorities for speeding up these plans, such as by the engagement of consultants. The Department
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0409">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
would be glad to give advice and help on any particular case put to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the ten-point plan, the other submission which the Government had on coming into office. This was prepared last year, I understand, and laid on the desk of the new Secretary of State, whoever he was to be, in September last year. The Government have looked closely at this, and I should like somewhat sketchily to comment upon the ten points. Hon. Members who are familiar with them will be able to check this as we go along.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first point is the early completion of the national tourist plan which the Board see emerging from the individual plans of local authorities under the 1962 circular, to which I referred earlier. The initiative in that lies with the local authorities. The Government are anxious, and have done everything they can in this regard, to encourage them. We had a ceremony of acceptance of the Roxburgh plan and the East Lothian plan in June.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Points two and three call for the establishment by the Government of a capital fund for loans at reasonable interest rates for new holiday accommodation and for a Government-built chain of hotels in rural areas. There are at present eleven extensions or new projects which involve 900 beds. Nevertheless, we accept the need for new and extended accommodation. It is, however, for the industry to provide it. The Government will encourage and help it to do so, but it is fundamentally for the industry to provide this. Grants and loans are available under the Local Employment Acts in most, although not all, tourist areas in Scotland. Between April, 1960, and May, 1965, the assistance offered was almost £650,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should like a greater use to be made of these facilities. They are there for the asking if the industry wants them. In the Highlands, they will be supplemented by the help which the new Highlands and Islands Development Board will be able to give if for any reason in a particular case the existing help is not enough. When we reflect that the Third reading of the Bill which establishes the Board will take place elsewhere today—and I hope that it will not be long before
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
it receives Royal Assent—we see how relevant it is to put this matter in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth recommendation is for an advisory service to hotel keepers. This is an excellent idea. There is no reason why this advisory service should not be self-financing. We shall co-operate with the industry in any way we can to get it going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We accept and heartily endorse the need for an accommodation inspection scheme—the fifth point. At our best, our hospitality is excellent, and it is quite wrong that our reputation should be put at risk by the backsliders. We shall encourage the new board to make this a priority in its programme. A trial scheme on a voluntary basis may be advisable in the first place. At least, when experience is gained it will be clear whether a statutory scheme is desirable. If, however, the Board wants a statutory scheme, the implication is that there must be a statutory board. This is a difficulty which we face in this regard. That is a nettle which we shall have to grasp at a future date, which may not be too far away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The sixth point—the more effective training of workers—is of central importance. A two-year full-time course, leading, we hope, to a new ordinary National Diploma in Catering will be introduced in 1965–66 at Napier College, Edinburgh, and perhaps also at Langside College, Glasgow. More advanced hotel and catering courses are being provided in the Scottish Hotel School which forms part of Stathclyde University. Other courses leading to City and Guilds of London certificates are provided by local education authorities and, at a humbler but no less important level, there are cookery classes for crofters' wives and others who give bed and breakfast. More important still, the Minister of Labour is giving a lead in the setting up of an industrial training board for the industry. I hope that this proposal will be welcomed by the industry, especially in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the provision of information bureaux—the seventh point—I was delighted to open a few weeks ago an information bureau in Berwick. It was built with enlightened self-interest by one of the great oil companies—Shell. It will be organised and run by the Scottish Tourist Board and its expenses will be met by the surrounding local authorities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0410">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Material will be provided by such bodies as the National Trust. The Committee will agree that this is an excellent example of the effectiveness of co-operation by the various bodies operating in the tourist field. I am convinced that the provision of information is a critical service and I hope that it is one of the subjects which will receive attention in the new research programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I come to the eighth point. As to the development of angling resources, the Report of the Hunter Committee will be published later this month, and my hon. Friend the Minister of State, representing the Government, will attend the championships of the European Federation of Sea Anglers at Ullapool in September. 
	<i>[Laughter.]</i> We place considerable importance on this, even though it may engender a little levity, understandably so, from hon. Members here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to additional facilities for motoring visitors—the ninth point of the plan—the Government propose to spend £123 million on building and improving roads in Scotland during the next five years up to 1970. Almost all of these improvements will benefit the tourist industry. That is one of the boasts which we made in the roads debate. Even with our present inadequate roads, Scotland is still a better country in which to go touring than is England. I must not, however, be tempted, as the hon. Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) once said, to be like Dr. Johnson and to love Scotland more than truth. That was a very good comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of £123 million will contrast with £72 million spent on works of this kind during the past five years. It is remarkable the pace at which we are planning road expansion programmes. The rate is not quite double, a jump from £72 million to £123 million is quite good going in view of our economic position. Not less than £18 million of this will be spent on building and improving roads in the Highlands and Islands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Examples of what is being done are the reconstruction to 18 ft. of the 53 miles of single track between Invergarry and Kyle of Lochalsh and the improvements to the roads in the Cairngorms which we have just approved. I agree that it may be necessary to look more
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
closely at this programme; we have said so to the representatives of all the Highland counties whom my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have met. We propose to meet more of them in the summer to get more clearly what the picture should be in this regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tenth point of the Board is an appeal for money for research. This is exactly what we have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tourism, I agree, deserves a new deal in Scotland and we are determined that we shall have it. If our economic position were substantially different, we might look at other possible ways of helping the industry, but within the present context we are doing as much as the Government think is wise and possible. Despite our limited resources, we are making a contribution which amounts for three years to more than one-third of the Board's existing disposable income and which is substantially more than the industry itself contributes. We are directing it in the way in which it will be most productive. It is the Government's duty to stimulate and support what is basically a private enterprise industry. It is now up to the industry itself to respond—to play a fuller part not only in the Board itself but in the need for better education, better investment and better information. Only then can the assets of Scotland as a tourist nation—the great natural beauty of the country and our traditional hospitality and friendliness as a people—be fully realised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir Fitzroy Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before proceeding to take that hint, Mr. Steele, perhaps I might point out that it is a good many years since I last made a speech from this position. It is certainly the first time that I have ever made a speech from the Front Bench of this Committee. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members will receive my remarks, perhaps not with the indulgence which they would grant to a maiden speaker, which I can hardly claim to be, but at least with a measure of indulgence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I go further, I should begin by declaring an interest in the subject under
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0411">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
discussion. I have no doubt that, to paraphrase a saying which has become famous, when hon. Members see me they do not say, "There goes the hon. Member who sits for Bute and North Ayrshire." They say, "There goes the man who keeps the pub on Loch Fyne-side." However, that is not necessarily a handicap in my task today. If one is talking about tourism there is advantage in having learned about it at first hand and, I would even say, the hard way. The Minister said something about amateurs in tourism, and I agree with him. I used to be an amateur but I soon had to stop being one. I also think that it is an advantage to speak as I do for a constituency where tourism is one of the principal and flourishing industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely glad that the Government have chosen the Scottish tourist industry as the subject for today's debate. I also welcome the relatively positive approach of the Under-Secretary of State and his acceptance of the main proposals of the Tourist Board, on which I should like to comment in a moment. An industry which has an annual value to Scotland of over £100 million and which also brings prosperity and employment indirectly—this is extremely important—to a whole range of other industries, including farming, furnishing, building and so on, is certainly well worth a couple of hours of our time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
No one will dispute that over the last 14 years or so, to take a period the significance of which will not escape hon. Members, the tourist industry in Scotland has made what the Chinese would call a great leap forward. I hope that it will do better than a great Chinese leap forward and will keep it up better than the Chinese have done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1951 three-and-a-half million visitors came to Scotland. In 1964 the figure was well over five million. Indeed, it has been over five million for several years past. As the Under-Secretary pointed out, this does not show that the momentum has been kept up at quite the same rate as previously, but to some extent that may be due to the weather. I am glad to say that last year's figures show a marked advance over those of the year before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figure of over five million tourists, which is about the same as the whole
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
population of Scotland, is in itself impressive. It also reflects considerable and successful efforts on the part both of the Government and, as the Minister rightly pointed out, of private enterprise, because this is above all a private enterprise industry. It is one which by its nature is much more adapted to private enterprise, and private enterprise is bound to and must play a big part in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During this period, a great deal has been done both to improve communications, which are of radical importance in this connection, particularly roads—and I am delighted to hear that this Government are to carry on the good work of the last Government on roads—and also in the provision of more amenities such as winter sports which, again, can be of the greatest importance in prolonging the season.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has also been, without doubt, a considerable expansion and an improvement in tourist accommodation of all kinds. Wherever I go in Scotland, I am very much impressed by the bigger hotels, the better hotels and the larger number of hotels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: And dearer hotels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other things, they have become a good deal dearer during the last nine months. I will leave the hon. Member to work out why. Looking at it as one may, these figures of five million to five-and-a-half million visitors a year also indicate a great increase in the general level of prosperity. The increase of nearly two million tourists a year since 1951 shows a great increase in the general level of prosperity in this country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That does not mean that there is not a great deal more to be done, both by the Government and also by private enterprise, and I was glad that the Under-Secretary of State recognised this. If we are to go on attracting tourists in a highly competitive world, we must at the same time go on improving our standards. I am certain that I need not draw the Under-Secretary's attention to the Scottish Tourist Board's most flattering appeal to the "good sense" of the Government and their exhortation to them to "wipe out the frustrations of the past by the promotion of a dynamic policy". I liked a great deal of what he said, but before I should feel able to accept it as a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0412">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
dynamic policy I should like to see it put into practice and to see some of the details worked out a little more fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.0 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the Tourist Board also recognises that "more sound work has been done in Scotland than in any other part of Britain to face future demands on holiday and leisure-time facilities". I am also glad that it pays a well-deserved tribute to the work of the Scottish Development Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will all have read the Board's latest report, which seems to me to make very good sense. I want to comment briefly on some of its proposals, as the Minister has done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As he said, there can be no doubt that the main problem faced by the industry is the shortness of the season. There is also the weather, but that is part of the same problem. Any research directed to finding out how the season can be extended by means of staggered holidays or fresh amenities in different parts of the country will be well worth while. In most parts of Scotland—with the possible exception of the winter sports areas—hotel keepers and those engaged in the tourist industry generally can count on being busy, and very often too busy, for only four or five months in the year—if that—while for the other seven or eight months they are almost certainly losing money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is bound to mean that they have very little, if any, spare cash for improvements or extensions of their premises, or even for maintenance. It also means that from a purely business and financial point of view there is not much inducement to improve or extend, because they know that in the season their hotels will be full anyway, however bad, and that in the winter they will be empty, however good and however big. They also know that, as a result of spending money on extensions and improvements, their overheads and the cost of maintenance will probably be bigger than ever.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all agreed that, if the Scottish tourist industry is to go on expanding, there must be more and better hotel accommodation and catering facilities. For this purpose two things are necessary—better credit facilities and tax concessions which are at least as favourable as those enjoyed by other industries. I
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
hope that the Secretary of State and his team at St. Andrew's House will make every effort to secure this. There have been no signs of it so far under this Government. On the contrary, we have had a credit squeeze and an increased Bank Rate, both of which, as I know to my cost, have made things very difficult for the small hotel keeper, who is bound to be operating on an overdraft for a good part of the year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Worst still, from what the Financial Secretary to the Treasury said in the debate on the Finance Bill, it looks very much as though such concessions as the last Chancellor made in respect of investment allowances will be withdrawn or tightened up. Unless the matter is put right soon, there is a serious danger that, instead of being maintained, the present trend towards expansion in the tourist industry will be reversed, and things will start to go backwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I personally favour a Government fund from which low-interest loans could be granted to hoteliers and others concerned in tourism for the purposes of expansion and improvement. Failing that, I hope that the Government will at any rate try to get rid of the restrictive measures which they have been forced to take. In the development districts quite a lot of help can be given, provided that the proposed extensions and improvements mean more employment, under the last Government's Local Employment Act, but more than this is required, and this purpose can in my view best be served by improved credit facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second big problem in the hotel and catering industry is the shortage of trained staff, as the Tourist Board clearly brings out in its Report. One of the first things you find out when you start trying to run a hotel is that unless you have trained staff in the key positions there is chaos. If a hotelier has trained staff, however, he can carry any amount of casual labour—students in vacation time, married women, girls working part-time, and so on. Without trained cadres this cannot be done; a professional backbone is needed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have seen it suggested that this is due partly to a feeling that there is something derogatory or undignified about the catering business. If so, the sooner we get rid of this idea, the better. There is nothing undignified or unworthy about
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0413">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
providing for the creature comforts of one's fellow-men. In this connection hon. Members may recall a passage on this subject in Stevenson's "Kidnapped", where the hero comes to an inn in Mull
	<br><blockquote><p>"with an innkeeper, who was a Maclean, it appeared, of a very high family; for to keep an inn is thought even more genteel in the Highlands than it is with us, perhaps as partaking of hospitality, or perhaps because the trade is idle and drunken."</p></blockquote>
I would add that the latter is a grossly libellous suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more real reason for the difficulty is a lack of sufficient training facilities. And I would urge the Government to do everything in their power to encourage the establishment of more hotel schools. Some hotel schools are already doing excellent work, but there are nothing like enough of them. On the teaching side, in winter these schools would provide a very useful occupation for trained staff, many of whom are bound to be short of a job. They could also help by providing trained cadres, and in that way help indirectly to provide jobs for more unskilled or semiskilled personnel, who might well, in turn, be attracted by what they thus saw of the trade and go into it on a permanent basis. That is a very important consideration in areas of relatively high unemployment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another recommendation which I was very glad to hear the Under-Secretary accept is that there should be a chain of information bureaux all over Scotland, and that every encouragement should be given to local tourist associations. In my experience wherever either or both of these have been set up—whereever there have been local tourist associations and local information centres—the tourist industry has started to flourish, as on the Clyde. It is far better that tourism should as far as possible be organised on a local basis and that funds should be raised and administered locally, with the local tourist associations working in as closely as possible with their local authorities. I am sure that a great deal can be done in this way, especially in organising local amenities, sports facilities, winter sports, pony trekking, deep sea angling, piping and dancing displays, ceilidhs and so on. And here I would pay tribute to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
excellent work which is being done by the Council for Physical Recreation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Y. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman be good enough to say whether he wants the Government to see that local associations are provided with statutory means of raising money?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was going on to say that while all this work is better done locally than centrally, in many cases outside financial help should be given by the Government. Whether local authorities should be given the means of raising the money from rates is debatable. But I believe that, once this work gets going, local authorities and hoteliers will see for themselves the enormous advantage to be gained from it, and will get organised locally of their own accord. I am sure that we should soon have some shining examples which would encourage other local organisations who otherwise would lag behind. But the moment a levy is imposed centrally, difficulties and ill-feeling are likely to arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Government's grant of more money to the Tourist Board, and look forward very much to hearing a little more about their proposals in this connection. This is a step in the right direction. I accept the need for research. The Tourist Board is doing a remarkable job, and even with this grant, will still be doing it on a shoestring, especially compared with corresponding organisations in other countries. I believe that its opposite number in Ireland receives £750,000 a year. I am certain that any increase in the sum allocated to the Board will be a first-class investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There can be no doubt that in the modern world it pays to advertise. That is one of the principal purposes of the Scottish Tourist Board, and it does it extremely well. I am sure that the maxim that it pays to advertise is truest of all of the tourist industry. As a country, we have a great deal to offer to our visitors; let us not make the mistake of hiding it under a bushel.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Neil Carmichael 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Woodside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my researches are correct, the last time that we spoke on tourism in this Committee was in December, 1963, when we were discussing the Countryside and Amenities Bill. On that occasion we spent three days on the Bill. I am

sure that if everyone then had spoken as briefly as the two Front Bench speakers have spoken today the entire Scottish representation in Parliament would have had a chance to take part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On that occasion, also, I followed the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean). I made particular reference to his own little place in Argyll. The most important single piece of advertising we have is the experience of people who visit Scotland. In the last debate it was fairly obvious that there was a great need for facts and figures on tourism. There were many facts, but they were mainly conflicting, and our discussion on tourism came down to personal experience, through travelling in the country.

In 1963 a number of hon. Members, including myself, made reference to the fact that Ireland, a country with many features similar to our own, had gone into tourism in a big way. In doing this they learned many things. From the article in yesterday's 
	<i>Scotsman</i> we found how big a menace the tourist industry in Ireland is to the Scottish tourist industry. This is a pity because, from the point of view of overseas visitors, Irish tourism should be complementary to Scottish tourism. When we get visitors over to Ireland it should be an easy thing to get them to Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Ireland was able to make tremendous strides in tourism because it gave the tourist board great powers. I agree that conditions were different in Ireland, because Ireland was so much more dependent on tourism than we are. It has a register, and I note that this is one of the features which we are hoping to have in Scotland—an inspection system, and a register. I hope that ours is as rigorous and—I was almost going to say punitive—as the Irish system, because it is punitive in that if one does not reach the standards which one sets out to reach, and if complaints are continual and substantiated, one is removed from the register, and that is an extremely serious matter for small hotels or guest houses. With all respect to the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire, I think that the Irish have concentrated to a very great extent on the small bed-and-breakfast place and have given grants to enable
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
people running small guest houses to expand their accommodation, perhaps by adding two rooms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about the need for loans or grants to those engaged in the tourist industry. I naturally included bed-and-breakfast places, crofters operating chalets and so on.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Carmichael</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry if I placed too much emphasis on the question of grants to hotels. I intend to shift the emphasis from hotels. From experience in the Western Highlands, and further north, I believe that the bulk of the tourist industry, over the next three years at least, will be conducted through the small bed-and-breakfast places. I do not say that this is all that is needed, but I think that this is the quickest way we can expand. If we build a single hotel it will take a great deal of money and will affect only one area, whereas money scattered to accommodation which already exists will help a great many more people in very many parts of the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference is continually being made to the fact that this is a highly competitive industry. This is only partly true. It is also a greatly expanding industry, and one which we hope will expand even further with the advent of automation and labour-saving devices and the rise in the standard of living. In the initial stages this market will be dealt with by the smaller places offering accommodation. In order to capture this market, advertising must obviously be used to a very large extent, but I think that we should be wary of taking big "splashes" in newspapers. I believe that, probably more than in any other industry, the personal touch is most important in the tourist industry. It is important that people should return from their holiday and tell others that they enjoyed it, and that it was what they expected, or even better than their expectations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is interesting to note that France is quickly pricing itself out of the tourist market. People are going further afield and are planning not to spend even one night in France because—and this may be an exaggeration—they have heard that France is very costly. The experience of people who have been there is making others avoid it.

	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Until now there has been a tendency to believe that the Scottish tourist industry was not only an expanding industry but a "get-rich-quickly" industry. The impression has been created in many minds that Scottish hotel owners, and even the owners of small accommodation, are overcharging. It was certainly true after the war that if one had a small hotel, somewhere in the country, preferably on the Clyde Coast, and worked for about three months of the year, one could manage a long holiday abroad during the winter months. I think that we are now suffering for the insufficient investment in the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been reports—and I have had experience of it myself—of a petty-mindedness in certain parts of the country, particularly in respect of let accommodation. An example which some friends have given me concerns overcharging for electricity in let cottages. They discovered that they were charged for electricity at the primary rate. Presumably everyone else was charged at the same rate. These people were objecting not to the fact that they were spending very much on the holiday but to the petty-minded way in which this was done. Compared with this, in Ireland, when holiday makers are squaring-up at the end of the day, the owner may say, "We will call it so much", and knock something off the bill. Perhaps the bill was too high at the beginning, and perhaps the Irish have a certain blarney which makes them able to do this. The idea which I am expressing is that the attitude towards people is very important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that if we are to have a viable tourist industry in Scotland, the backbone of it must be the home market, the people from the industrial belt who will come in the early part of the season and at the end of the season. That is where the Government can perhaps do something, not only in regard to tourism but in respect of other matters, because we are reaching a point at which everyone is going on holiday at the same time and travelling at the same time. The Government will have to look at this very seriously. The whole question of staggering hours and holidays must be investigated. Some attempt has been
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
made to deal with the problem by putting August Bank Holiday back a month, but I think that more could be done, and as holidays increase I hope that the early holiday, or the extra week, will not the crowded into one part of the year. There should be a good spread-over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that what cripples the tourist industry is the fact that the season is so short. I was surprised to hear the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire say that it was about four months. My impression had been that it was even less than that in its full effectiveness. I hope that at some point some Government will be courageous enough to make an attempt to increase the spread-over of holidays.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Scotland we have enormous advantages over many other countries. We do not have the weather which people might want on their holiday all the time, but I think we should make people realise that our weather may be the best weather to have at certain times of the year. We all agree that there is nothing nicer, if equipped for it, than a holiday in the Trossachs or farther north in September or early Spring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that with the expansion of the industry, and the encouragement which the Government are obviously giving to it, together with the points enumerated by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, the Scottish tourist industry can have a tremendous future, if we change our attitude and learn from other countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Y. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The 
	<i>Scotsman</i> has given us the Government's intentions for tourism in Scotland, and although I think that the leak is disgraceful, the 
	<i>Scotsman</i> has done a very valuable job in the analysis which it made of tourism in Scotland. From the newspaper's point of view this is good journalism, and it has been valuable to Members of this Committee. It is a good job that the 
	<i>Scotsman</i> announced this yesterday, because it at least cushioned the shock and the rage which a number of people have felt there at the puny efforts which the Government are making. It appears that the Minister is simply saying, "We are hard up and here is an area which does not count. Therefore we shall not do very much about it". He hid behind the necessity to obtain more information.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0416">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Instead of great push we are to have a reconnaissance by a section. This is no good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He talked about computers and the great modern age when we were to have information. This is nonsense. Of course the information is valuable, but it will never absolve business men, or Ministers, from taking an initiative on their own and using the computer which they have built into their heads to reckon up chances and to take a decision requiring foresight, without waiting to be reassured by every statistic in the world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The acoustics in this room are not very good. Certain people are not hearing the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. George Y. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to put that right. We do not need a lot of statistics to tell us that an egg is not quite round. This appears to be the case in the Scottish tourist industry. Certain facts are obvious, and they should be obvious to the Government through the acts of the successful tourist nations, such as Switzerland, France and lately Ireland. There they have gone ahead because the Governments have realised that, although it is a private enterprise industry, it is up to the Government to play their part. After all, the people give the Government the money in taxation to do things such as this. The Government are one of the better central organisations for collecting and dispersing money to help industry. That is what is needed in the tourist industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Various methods of raising local money have been suggested in the past and greeted with howls of indignation. This was demonstrated by the "sixpence a bed" controversy a year or two ago. There is no doubt that the Government must take the responsibility for giving a substantial grant. The Under-Secretary of State talked about the ten-point plan.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Steele. An appeal was made by you at the beginning of this debate to hon. Members on both sides, including the Front Benches, to restrict what they had to say to as short a time as possible. If interruptions are to continue from hon. Gentlemen
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Interruptions are not a matter for me. If the hon. Member who has the Floor gives way, there is nothing I can do about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Sir F. Maclean</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want briefly to clarify a point about raising local money. The proposal was that the Tourist Board should raise money not locally but all over Scotland and should administer it centrally. That was one of the snags. I would add that my intervention has taken a shorter time than the point of order raised by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean). I will be as brief as I can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not talking about you, George.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interruptions take up time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was talking about the ten-point plan of the Scottish Tourist Board. This was allied to a request for an annual Government grant of some £200,000.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has not been forthcoming. Instead there is to be £25,000 a year from the Government. I understand that this means that the smaller Highland tourist associations will get no further help from the Government. It was extraordinarily mean of the Government to keep these people hanging on. Question after question has been asked about this and then, in the middle of the season, it is announced that £25,000 a year will be spent on research but that no special grant will be available to help the Highland associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The associations should have been told definitely of the Government's view long ago and many of them would not have started, in these circumstances, their summer programmes in the hope of receiving a Government subvention in the middle of the season. The Government's reply is bad business, mean and shortsighted. I am sorry to have to say that, but it is true.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0417">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
I am naturally talking about the Highlands in particular because I know them and they are my special interest. The local authorities there are desperately poor. The hon. Gentleman himself has referred many times to the financial straits they are in and to the need for some alternative method of raising money. Tourism is one of their main industries, and I do not see where they can raise the money to help the local tourist associations. They are already hard put to it to meet their statutory requirements for education and other services. I do not think they can raise more money for tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The figures of tourism vary, but they do not vary enough for us not to know that tourism is of tremendous importance and brings about £100 million into the country each year. Surely, for £100 million any commercial enterprise would not hesitate to spend 1 per cent. of such a sum—just £1 million a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Hear, hear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only method which I can see of collecting such a large amount as is needed is for the Government to do it. But the Government have not even put forward any plan to help.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We do not make the £100 million.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Mackie</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government have simply said that they want information and research and that they are not prepared to take responsibility for tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Irish Tourist Board is spending about £1·9 million on the Irish tourist industry in various ways and, according to 
	<i>The Scotsman,</i> 97 per cent. of this money comes from the Irish Government. I think that that must be so. We need capital in the Scottish tourist industry and, apart from advertising, I do not see why the Government cannot set up a revolving fund.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Local Employment Act, a certain amount is available if more people are employed as a result, but this cannot apply, for instance, to crofters, who may want more accommodation to employ themselves properly in tourism, or to many of the smaller hotels who want to make the fullest use of their capital. I admit the difficulty of the finan-
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
cial situation, but if the Government cannot afford to lay out capital of this type they should at least think in terms of trying to make people make the best use of the capital which they have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Woodside (Mr. Carmichael) both stressed the shortness of the season. Surely any businessman would say, "Let us work rather longer or double shift and try to extend the season." I think that this can be done quite easily by advertising if people knew the sort of weather in Scotland in early Spring and late Autumn. I would perhaps be rather vulgar and advertise in the Autumn, in a big campaign in England, saying "Why do you think the Royal Family are still in Scotland? Because they know that this is when the weather is good and Scotland is a good country to be in."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At present, there is the idea abroad that people can go to Scotland only during a short season. But in July the weather is usually at its worst and it is raining. We who know the Highlands rather better know that in the early Spring and late Autumn the weather is far better. Getting an extension of the season can be done only by letting people know how good the weather is in early Spring and late Autumn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, we in Scotland, particularly the Highlands, contribute enormously to the Exchequer through the whisky duty. I know that everybody is inclined to laugh at that, but it is an enormous contribution, and surely the Scottish Office could have pointed this out seriously to the Treasury in asking for a very small percentage of that money, which could do a great deal for tourism in the Highlands and in Scotland generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have many other attractions to offer, apart from scenery. One can divide the tourists into two types. There are those who drive round, admire the scenery, stop at a different place each night and then leave. They are very valuable, and there is no doubt that we must provide good accommodation for them and try to sell them a great many other things which our crafts can offer so that they do not go away unmilked and unsatisfied. That is a valuable section of the tourist industry, and it will increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0418">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
But in Scotland we have another type of holidaymaker—the visitors who used, for instance, to go to a village such as Tomintoul and stay all summer, and there was a visitors' concert at the back end of the season. These people returned again and again. That is the type of family holiday which can be developed greatly if more people know about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also see that fishing is available. Sea fishing must be developed, and I am glad that the Minister of State is to go sea fishing. I hope that it is a fine day, that he takes the Under-Secretary of State with him and that they add a great deal to the national larder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both types of holiday are valuable, and it does not matter about the weather. If one holidays in Argyll, one must expect bad weather. But as long as one makes up one's mind that one will do what one wants despite the weather, and that when one returns home each day there is hot water available, one can always enjoy oneself. That sort of thing could be valuable to many people in this country and abroad if they knew about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key is advertising. The Government must accept the responsibility. They have been mean and short-sighted in their present policy, and it is a great disappointment. Many of us hoped that they would be more far-seeing than the last Government. The Government should realise that it is their responsibility to provide the money for massive advertising now. It is no good spending £1,500 on advertising in England against the massive campaign by the Irish, which I understand costs £100,000. We have to match that sort of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The amount which the Government are proposing to expend is useless. It will be like trying to bale out The Minch with a teaspoon. What the Government are claiming as sufficient for tourism in Scotland is like trying to floodlight Edinburgh Castle with one candle.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. William Baxter</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have listened to the speech of my Liberal Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. George Y. Mackie) and I think that most of us would agree—certainly I do—with almost 100 per cent. of what he said during the first part of his speech, when, to some extent, he criticised my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and his approach to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
I cannot see very much difference between the attitude of my right hon. Friends to this very important industry and the attitude of the last Government. I do not think that the Government are seized of the great potentialities of the industry. No doubt computers can bring more knowledge to the Government than is at present available, but there is sufficient light on the subject already to permit my hon. Friends and others to make up their minds about what should be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am always interested, when we discuss an industry such as this, to hear the various figures trotted out. For instance, it is said that Scottish tourism earns the national Exchequer £100 million in foreign currency. That is not the true way in which to look at a balance sheet. One should not look only at the income. There is also the expenditure. The tourist industry as a whole spends a great deal of money, even in foreign countries, to provide the luxuries which visitors want, not only in accommodation, furnishing, etc., but also in food.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I declare an interest here. Those of us who are interested in the hotel industry recognise that much of the food which we give to visitors may include, for instance, ham from Denmark and fruit from America or Australia. Even when they go to the little shops to buy presents to take home they find, very often, that the dolls indicating a Scottish character of some sort or other are made in Hong Kong or Japan. It is unadulterated nonsense to talk as though the tourist industry brings so much wealth to the country and spends nothing. If my hon. Friend's computer does anything it should be to shed a proper light on the income and expenditure of the tourist industry to give us a clear picture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has made a declaration of intent, and I am very disturbed about it. I would rather see decisions. I am concerned by the tendency in Government today, which has gone on for some time, to pass our responsibility to some Committee or other which has no direct responsibility to Parliament, which has been elected by the people. I counsel my hon. Friend to give a little more consideration to this aspect of Government, not only on this subject but
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0419">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
on many others, too. Government can be great only by the decisions of the leaders of Government. If we are not able to lead the people on the road they should travel, we should not be here, whatever our political complexion may be. I deprecate very much this tendency to pass the buck and the lack of decision by our leaders. We are the leaders of our people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 a.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After that little aside or homily to my hon. Friends on their responsibilities, I come back to the subject matter of the debate. What do visitors get in this country? What do we give them? The beauty of our land is unsurpassed in any part of the world. In its variation and compact nature we have a variety of everything which man could desire, beautiful land, healthy climatic conditions and a considerate and kindly people. This we do not put across to the fullest extent. As we travel through the world we find very few people who have the kindly considerate nature of Scottish people. We have never put that across to the fullest extent. One thing which strikes me most forcibly in other countries is the sheer bad manners and lack of consideration shown by foreigners. I can think of only one small country, not unlike Scotland in many respects—Japan—where we find the same kindliness and good manners as those shown in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thing which we fail to put across to the visitors is that not only do they get all the things which Nature has provided but they get something else in Scotland which no other country provides. If a visitor comes to our land and is taken ill, as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary knows, he gets care and attention free, gratis and for nothing. This is a great thing for any visitor to this country, but I counsel anyone going abroad to insure against illness because he may find it a very costly situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Previous Governments have made very great mistakes and have not given proper care and attention to the need for improving our holiday resorts and helping the tourist industry to the fullest possible extent, but I had hoped this morning to hear from my hon. Friend a new policy statement to be operated immediately. I hoped that he would say that at Loch Lomond we should immediately start to
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
build a new road on the other side of the Loch so that visitors could enjoy not only one side but also the other. Why should this not be done? This is a beautiful part of the country, and it is in my constituency. That is another reason why this should become an accomplished fact. I counsel my hon. Friend to give serious consideration to the desirability of making another road on the other side of Loch Lomond. It is not an engineering impossibility and it would open up the whole area to tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with what my hon. Friend said about the registration of hotels, boarding houses and restaurants. The standard should be raised, and visitors and even people in our country should know without a shadow of doubt where they can get good accommodation, good food, good wine and so on. I applaud my hon. Friend's efforts in this respect. The R.A.C. and the A.A. have fallen short of their original intention when they have given tourist gradings to various hotels and restaurants. It becomes the responsibility of the Government, just as it is the responsibility of the Government of Ireland, to institute a register of this kind. I gather that my hon. Friend has this very much in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be in the interests not only of foreign visitors but of our own people if the hotel and boarding house accommodation were brought up to as high a standard as possible. As the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) said, the difficulty in outlandish areas is the seasonal nature of this trade. Boarding houses and small hotels are occupied for only a short time during the summer. We have to try to extend our season, but we must be careful and realistic so that we do not put too heavy a burden on owners of hotels by compelling them to do something which their finances cannot undertake, unless the Government give very substantial grants towards such expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am happy to know that the Under-Secretary has indicated that there will be a great deal done to provide new training schools for the hotel industry. We can build as many hotels as we like and expand the industry as much as we care, but unless we get staff sufficiently trained in the obligations of looking after guests, the whole industry will fall into a state of disrepute. I know how difficult it is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0420">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
to get a chef. At present it is almost impossible. I have practical experience of this part of the industry. I applaud wholeheartedly any effort which the Government may make towards the establishment of more schools for training hotel staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect of the problem is the unsightly nature of some parts of Scotland. All Scotland is not beautiful, but all Scotland could be beautiful if the ravages committed by man were made to disappear. We have not gone far enough in the clearing of pit bings. Much has been done in past years, but many of these unsightly things remain. They have been put there by man's hand, and we have a responsibility to see that they are cleared away at the earliest possible moment. I have no doubt that I represent the most beautiful part of Scotland, Stirlingshire, but even the present Government—far-sighted as they are, have failed to take 100 per cent. responsibility for the clearing away of unsightly bings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For instance, at Dumbreck at Kilsyth a considerable amount of money will be required to clear a bing. The local authority has offered an 80 per cent. grant, but that is not sufficient; this should be a 100 per cent. responsibility of the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One may go along the road to another beautiful part of Scotland, steeped in history—my Liberal Friends will support this—where Bannockburn was fought. There one sees an unsightly bing beside the field of Bannockburn which should be cleared away as soon as possible. In that beautiful part of Scotland the Carse of Stirling is pockmarked with bings put there by the hand of man, and they should be cleared away.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not immune in this age from desecration of the countryside. I am amazed that even in private development: and especially in local authority development, monstrosities are erected throughout the land. They are a disgrace to our day and generation. I counsel my hon. Friend that when private development plans or public plans for housing and so on are placed before his Department they should be scrutinised with the greatest degree of care to see that the at least come up to the standard of good taste. It is disgraceful that some of the monstrosities which have been erected
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
have been allowed. I hope that these words will be taken to heart.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When we discussed the Countryside and Tourist Amenities (Scotland) Bill, I condemned the then Secretary of State for suggesting a tax on any visitors coming to Scotland. I said that because I think it bad to differentiate between England and Scotland, but I am not against a tax of some sort on visitors coming to Britain, for it is wiser that they should know that in this country they are getting more than any other country can offer and that they should make some contribution. If we go to America we find that the food consumed in every restaurant is taxed. We must make people realise that we are giving them something of great value and we should make them pay for the privilege of enjoying what we can give them. Often if we make a material too cheap and give it away for next to nothing, as we have been doing for far too long in the tourist industry, we make people doubt whether it is good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talk about the rain and the mist—what glorious rain, what lovely mist! My goodness, is it not something worth while to go out in the mist and come back to the warm log fire and enjoy a drop of toddy? A great asset to Scotland after the beauty of the countryside is a glass of our good, clear, sparkling water. If we could take that to some people who have been denied the pleasure of good sparkling water, we should tempt them to come to Scotland. There was an old song, "Singing in the Rain". Even if we do get a little rain, it should be a great national asset, for people can come and enjoy the rain, the mist and the sunshine and good food such as no one else can provide. They can enjoy the great benefits provided by the generous and wonderful people of our land. We do not need to apologise. We can go forth with pride in the fact that we have something worthwhile to offer and a heritage of which we must all be proud.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Forbes Hendry</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have listened to an absolutely splendid oration by the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter). In addition to being a wonderful oration, it contained a great deal of common sense. I know that he will realise that it is quite unnecessary for me to underline the points which he
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0421">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
made so well. I am in agreement with a great many of them and I have great sympathy with what he said about pit bings. I am a constituent of his, and as a matter of private enterprise I have been trying to get a pit bing removed from behind the hon. Member's hotel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to deal with two points made by the hon. Member. One is the attractions which we have to offer in Scotland. The other is the means of getting to Scotland to enjoy them. These are very important matters. To a large extent we keep our light under the bushel and people in other countries do not know what we have to offer. Only last week I had a visit from a young American. He said that he had just been to Scotland. I asked him how he liked it, and he said that it was "Not bad". I asked where he had been, and he said that he went to Hamilton. I asked whether he went beyond Hamilton and he said, "Yes, I went to Kirkintilloch". He did not go so far as the hon. Member's hotel. He went back to America without realising what Scotland has to offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have a duty to make clear what we have to offer and to make sure that it is organised in a professional way. I refer back to what the hon. Member for West Stirlingshire said about passing the buck. Far too often the Government have passed the buck to local associations in matters in which the Government themselves as a central authority should take a hand. In Scotland there is a completely artificial division between the Highlands and what are not the Highlands. This makes absolute nonsense such as that of the situation in an area of great natural attraction, the Cairngorms, which are half in the Highlands and half not in the Highlands. There is an actual geographical distinction because no road connects the two halves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State knows all about this because he was kind enough recently to receive the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) and me and delegations from our respective county councils. We explained what was necessary in the way of a road, and he expressed sympathy. I must, however, underline the necessity to develop an area
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
like that as a unit, not only for summer visitors, but for what is now becoming an important aspect of tourism in Scotland, and that is winter sports. As the hon. Member for Inverness will agree, it has brought great prosperity to his county. My hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur) will also underline that it has brought great prosperity to part of his constituency down as far as Blairgowrie, as it has done to my constituency, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty, however, about Scottish winter sports as compared with, say, Swiss winter sports is that the whole area is divided into three separate areas, two of which are in Inverness-shire, which are reasonably accessible one to the other, and the other of which is in Perthshire and Aberdeenshire. It is essential to bring this into focus as one individual Scottish winter sports area. It can be done, and it would be expensive, but I impress upon the Government the necessity of getting on with this as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we should realise the winter sports potential in Scotland. Only last week I was in the Cairngorms and I saw a stretch of half-a-mile of ski-able snow in the month of July. That is something which is not to be found at this time of year in Switzerland. I do not say that everybody wants to ski in July, but it shows that there is a late skiing season in Scotland if only it can be developed. We might find that there was snow in Inverness-shire and not in Aberdeenshire, or 
	<i>vice versa.</i> The Government have to realise that they have a responsibility for the organisation of Scotland and of areas of Scotland as unities and to advertise those areas, not on a local basis, but on a national basis. I know that the Under-Secretary realises the importance of this, and I hope that he will do everything that he possibly can to impress this upon his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and upon the Treasury, who must be brought into it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I have paid tribute to the Under-Secretary for his knowledge of these things, I must criticise the Government on another side of tourism in Scotland. I refer to the access and means of access to Scotland. We want people to come from abroad, and we have done a great deal to get them, but it seems
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0422">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
to me that the Government have done a great deal to make it difficult to get to Scotland. A great many people coming to Scotland would come by air. Many of us were horrified—"disappointed" is far too mild a word—when the Ministry of Aviation only this year by their policy discouraged the independent airlines which were willing to provide services to Scotland. As the Under-Secretary knows, an inquiry is conducted into licences and applications for licences for airlines to Scotland. I hope that the Scottish Office will use its influence with the Minister of Aviation and make certain that we get the air services to Scotland which we badly require. It is impossible at this time of year even for a Member of Parliament to say that he is certain of getting on an aeroplane to Scotland. Last week I found it impossible to get an air booking by British European Airways—not that this was any fault of B.E.A.; it was simply because of overloading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Scottish Office should encourage the independent airlines to run services to Scotland, not only from England, but through services from European countries. That would be of great value to us. I believe that independent airlines are willing to risk their capital in providing experimental services between Scotland and the Continent, and I hope that the Scottish Office will use its great influence with the other central Government Departments in that connection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish also to mention another point about access to Scotland. About a year ago, I had occasion to go to Scandinavia, and I was horrified to find that apart from a steamer about once a fortnight from Iceland to Leith and to Copenhagen, there was no direct passenger service between Scotland and the Continent of Europe. To get to Scandinavia we have to go to Newcastle, and if we want to go further south we have to go to the South of England to get steamer or ferry services to the Continent. It seems to me that there is a crying need for a direct ferry service between the North of Europe and Scotland, because the tourist potential from the North of Europe to Aberdeen, Leith or any of the East Coast ports in Scotland could be of great importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend has mentioned, in particular, the port of Aberdeen. Aber-
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
deen is particularly suitable for this purpose, because the shortest sea passage across the North Sea is from Aberdeen to Norway. Once a service were established between Scotland and, say, the port of Arendal, in South Norway, a tremendous tourist potential would be opened up, because Arendal is a junction of various ferry services from Sweden, Denmark, North Germany and countries beyond. There is there a vast tourist potential which would come to Scotland if only the facilities were given.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result of my researches last year, I have as a matter of purely private enterprise, unassisted by anybody, been in correspondence ever since with various shipping interests in Norway. As the Secretary of State well knows, there are shipping interests in Norway who are willing and anxious to establish a drive-on, drive-off ferry service between Scotland and Norway with connections to other countries in Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In January this year I wrote to the Secretary of State and told him about these negotiations and what my correspondents in Norway were willing to do. They had actually taken a tender for a ship for this purpose from French shipbuilders. I explained to my Norwegian friends that a French ship would, perhaps, be unwelcome in Scotland, and I suggested that they might go a bit further and get a tender from a Scottish shipyard for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My Norwegian friends took me up on that, and I am now in a position to tell the Under-Secretary that they have received a tender from a Clyde shipyard, Stephen of Linthouse, for the building of such a ship. Such an order would be of great value to Scotland—it would be worth over £1 million—and the effect on Scottish trade and industry of producing a ship of this sort would be widespread, not only in the Clyde, but subsequently for the tourist industry in Scotland. I undertake to give the hon. Gentleman full details of the tender within the next day or two. I am not sure how far the information is confidential, but I hope that he will take this up seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was disappointed in January, when I took up the matter with the Secretary of State, that I was given very little encouragement. I wrote fully on 13th January to the Secretary of State. I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0423">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
told him all that was involved and that approaches were being made to Scottish shipyards for the building of such a ship. I had a reply on 22nd January from the noble Lord Lord Hughes, in his capacity as Under-Secretary of State, in which I was given very little encouragement, and I was told that it was a purely commercial matter and should be dealt with through commercial channels. Certainly, a great deal of the money could be provided by long-term credits by the Board of Trade, and I agree that the approach should be made direct to the Board of Trade. This is, however, a matter of such importance to Scotland that the Scottish Office should realise its responsibilities to Scotland in this matter and take it up seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems a great pity that Norwegian enterprise should be the only people who are willing to undertake a matter of this sort. There is no doubt that the Norwegians would probably have much more in mind the traffic the other way from this country to Norway. I hope that the Scottish Office will take up this suggestion seriously as a matter of urgency, because unless an order for a ship is placed within the next month or so, we shall lose a whole season.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot impress upon the Government too much the necessity for a service of this sort for the whole of Europe. The drive-on, drive-off ferries from the South of England are commercially extremely successful. I have details of costings which I have supplied to the Secretary of State. I hope that the Scottish Office will take up the matter seriously, not only to make clear to people overseas what we have to offer in Scotland but to provide the facilities, not only by air but by sea, for people to get here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: After such a large proportion of business men have taken part in the debate, I should make it clear at the outset that I have no financial interest in any business of any kind anywhere. First, I should like to drive home one point. In spite of what was said during the passage of the Highland Development (Scotland) Bill about tourism not being a substitute for attracting permanent industry to Scotland, nevertheless we must appreciate that tourism is big business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
One thousand million pounds a year is earned in this country from tourists. Of this, £300 million is in foreign currency. It is, therefore, a very important business. Secondly, and more important still, it is an expanding industry for the simple reason that as people earn more money and have more leisure in which to spend it, the figure will grow and we must see that we get a fair and increasing share of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. George Y. Mackie) made two remarkable statements. First, he said that we should get the public to ask why the Royal Family spends the Spring in Scotland. That is a dangerous train of thought, because people might well follow on by asking why they spend so much of their time outside Scotland. That would not be a good line to follow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Secondly, we were told by the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) that this was mainly a private enterprise industry, and we were told by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland that no private business would grudge spending 1 per cent. of its earnings on publicity. The hon. Member mentioned that it brought in £100 million to Scotland. Therefore, he said, this private enterprise industry, earning £100 million, should have the 1 per cent. spent, not by private industry, but by the Government. There is something strange about this line of reasoning.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Member give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I am sorry, there is not time. The reason why the tourist industry has not done much better in Scotland is that it is largely in the hands of private industry, which is sometimes called private enterprise. In fact, it is not very enterprising at all. While it may be willing to advertise its own hotels and to spend its 1 per cent. on that, it is loth to co-operate to advertise on a large scale over the whole country or even a whole area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0424">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
I know this because in the City of Dundee we have tried to organise hoteliers and other business men who benefit from tourism and to get them to contribute reasonable sums towards advertising Dundee. All the time, they want the Government, the local authority or somebody else to supply the money. They are not prepared to supply it. This is where private enterprise falls down in tourism. It is out for quick personal profit and is not prepared to make financial sacrifice for long-term profits unless it is only for itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is rather strange that this private enterprise industry not only wants to get so much of the funds from the Government, from local authorities or tourist boards, but wants the local authorities to supply the information offices, to pay for them and to staff them. They want publicity officers to be organised, appointed and paid for by local authorities. They are not prepared to pay for it themselves, but they reap the benefit. Who sends the delegations to exhibitions in other parts of the country, and pays for them? It is not the hoteliers; it is the local authorities, who do not derive any benefit?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.15 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a fantastic set up. I suggest that a Government Department should be made directly responsible for organising the tourist industry, because if things are left to private enterprise they never will be organised in a proper way so that we have a better share in the tourist industry. We must attract tourists to Scotland by offering them something which they cannot get elsewhere. It is no use simply advertising sandy beaches, because these can be found anywhere. What can we offer them?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are winter sports, which are not available in England. The Tay and Forth Road Bridges will be attractions to many people. We have water ski-ing on Loch Earn, and there is also something which is not advertised nearly enough, namely, our free Health Service. We ought to advertise that much more.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Ian Mac Arthur</div> <!-- member -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Doig</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, we should advertise it much more. The amount of money
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
spent on it is far smaller than the amount of value which it brings in the way of visitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tourists want value for money. They want good accommodation, good food and good entertainment, at reasonable prices. We can offer them this, and we do not boast enough about it. For some reason which I do not understand, Dundee has fewer visitors than Aberdeen, Edinburgh or Glasgow, yet it is one of the finest cities in Scotland for scenery and amenities. We do not advertise sufficiently the sporting facilities which are available in Scotland. My constituency is surrounded by first-class golf courses, where people can play at reasonable prices. We have two first-class 18-hole golf courses in the city, where a round costs 3s., and pensioners can play for 1s. 6d. We should be advertising these facts, because many people who would like a golfing holiday do not know about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many people like to play bowls. In Dundee one can get a ticket to play as often as one likes each week for 4s. For pensioners the cost is 1s. 6d. These facts should be hammered home to a far greater extent. I could give more illustrations, but there is not time. I leave these thoughts with the Committee in the hope that this line will be pursued, so that more visitors will be attracted to Scotland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Patrick Wolrige-Gordon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no time to pursue the points made by the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig). He would have made an interesting target. Tourism is important to our country, because we have the loveliest scenery in the world, and millions of people want to see it. But we have another advantage, in that of all our industries in Scotland tourism is the most broadly based, because it has many of its roots in other lands, in the hearts of all the first, second, third and fourth generation Scotsmen who, while making their great contributions to the wealth of the lands in which they now live, look forward to the time when they can return to the land from which they came.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some people are rather bashful about tourism, but I do not feel bashful about it. No country with a hard-headed business sense can feel bashful about it. Even with us it is worth about £100 million a year, and that is big business and good
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0425">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
business, and it helps our balance of payments. But I am bashful about some of the practices which creep into tourism. Overcharging visitors, capitalising on their ignorance, wheedling extra tips out of them, and so on, are nauseating practices. There is not much of this in Scotland—not among proper Scotsmen, anyway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister made an interesting speech, as he often does, but I was concerned about his remarks relating to the need for data and research. When I hear of the need for facts, research and data, I often think that it is merely an escape from action. I hope that that is not the case here. I am sure that all my hon. Friends were delighted to hear that the Minister will attend the angling competition at Ullapool. I hope that he catches a very big fish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the tourist industry is to move into big business it will need a certain amount of outside help. Where will that help come from? Already large industries are developing in the Cairngorms. I am glad that they are Scottish controlled, because there is a danger—examples of this can be found all over the world, from the West Indies to the Greek Islands—that foreign financiers and monolithic concerns will take over beautiful parts of the world and butcher them, raising anonymous hotels of glass and concrete and transforming the whole scene with bulldozers, straight away erasing the particular atmosphere and national sense of locality which gave the area its charm in the first place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That must not happen in Scotland, and it need not happen, if our hotels are given the wherewithal and opportunity to expand their business and to move ahead. If the Government do not wish to provide the opportunity, sooner or later money will come in from outside. It may come from people who care less for Scotland than for a quick £1 million or £2 million from its scenic beauty. I should prefer the Scottish tourist industry to stand on its own feet and to offer its own quietly distinctive type of hospitality to our visitors. I beg the Government to reconsider the question of establishing some sort of capital fund and giving hotel and boarding house keepers the opportunity to borrow at reasonable rates in order to enlarge and modernise their premises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
I should also like to know how we are progressing with the hotel and boarding house inspection scheme. My constituency is a gourmet's paradise. Nowhere will he find such fresh, high-quality food, so well cooked, as in the hotels and watering places in East Aberdeenshire. But such quality is not uniform. It is essential that we should take effective steps to prevent innocent visitors from being snared into places of low degree. We must at least try to set a standard to which everybody can aspire, and those who do not achieve that standard can be marked. Sometimes the best hospitality can be obtained from bed-and-breakfast places. They should not be interfered with. They are clearly marked, in any event. Also, they are like the tennis players at Wimbledon—amateurs in a certain sense. Tourism is not their sole means of livelihood, but often they give the best service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
But in respect of the full-time professionals, in the shape of hotels and boarding houses, which are taking on the real burden of the industry, we should set standards of performance to which they can adhere, and we should establish a system of inspection to keep them up to that standard. In some form or other this is normal practice in most industries, and it should be in tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Lastly, I should like to see the introduction of an advisory scheme which could advise hoteliers on development projects. That is absolutely essential. Assistance is given to farmers in order to develop their properties, and I do not see why the same thing should not operate for hotel keepers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Rankin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: During the course of these debates one always learns something. This morning I have learnt what a terrible gap exists between the preaching of those who say that they believe in fair shares and the way in which they practise it. I hope that I may be forgiven for that passing remark. Time is short, and I must confine myself to a few points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I challenge the figure of £100 million derived from tourism. I have done so before and do so again. We must first ask ourselves how much of our money goes abroad in tourism. Until we strike a balance we cannot place a true value on tourism in this country.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0426">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
The greatest tourist centre in Scotland has not been mentioned during the debate, which is rather astonishing. I refer to Glasgow. From there it is possible to go to any part of Scotland by steamer, by rail, by coach and by plane. There is not other city in the whole of Scotland of which that can be said. There is no other city in which so many tourists can take advantage of these tremendous transport facilities. From Govan Pier, in Glasgow, we used to do one of the finest tours in Europe—starting at the Broomielaw, after Govan, then on to Ardrishaig, through the Crinan Canal, next to Oban, then up Loch Linnhe to Fort William, and then by rail across to Bonavie, joining the steamer, on which I served four four years as a purser, to sail through the Great Glen. We carried hundreds of people every day. Today not one person is carried.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that tourism is diminishing. The Report refers to it as the Cinderella of the services. Why is it diminishing? Since time is short I will only state that one reason is the high cost of holidaying in Scotland; in which connection I have discussed one aspect with the hon. Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean). At this moment I am trying to get the sixth form of one of the biggest grammar schools in the City of London into accommodation on the west coast of Scotland to carry out geological and botanical studies next March. The cheapest price which I can get is 17 gns. per week for a Scottish hotel. That is shocking. I know there is talk of a short season but the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) has answered that point. There is no short season in Scotland, there is only a short season with the landlords, who are helping to run the Scottish Board today. They are making a long season more and more difficult to get. I welcome the news that the Board is to be changed. I hone that in the reduced numbers we shall have less representation from landlordism than on the existing Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.30 p.m.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite the fact that Glasgow is the greatest tourist centre in the country, the Scottish Tourist Board, in all the years of its authority, has never placed an office in that city. Then it complains that tourism is diminishing. It is diminishing due to inefficiency on the part of those
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
responsible for operating it. The hon. Member for West Stirlingshire (Mr. W. Baxter) should have thought of that when he said what he did about my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock (Dr. Dickson Mabon). There has been inefficiency in places where there should have been efficiency, and the Tourist Board must take trie blame for failing to encourage tourism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At this moment there are tours from London to the Italian coast at Rimini, under the auspices of Co-operation, costing £47 10s. for a fortnight, including the air fare. If one went to Clydeside today one would be lucky to get a house for £40 a month. The ladies of Luss, Balloch and Largs and other places are seeking to step in and supply a service which the hotels have failed to supply at prices which everyone—hikers and motorists—can afford—25s. a night for bed and breakfast. This will cheapen the whole holiday and will bring more people to Scotland, a job which the Tourist Board has failed to do. I am glad to hear that the Board is to be reduced in numbers and is to be given a better and fresher complexion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Michael Noble</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should like to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Bute and North Ayrshire (Sir F. Maclean) on his excellent speech at the beginning of this Committee's proceedings. I thought that he demonstrated with a great deal more effect than did the hon. Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig), the one hon. Gentleman who declared no interest in the business whatsoever, the importance of people speaking to the Committee with first-hand knowledge. I sympathise with the Secretary of State, who I expect has broken other important engagements to be here at the end of this debate, over the problem of the leak, for which his hon. Friend made a very handsome apology, though he said that it was no fault of the Scottish Office. I am bound to say that that does not surprise me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was a little worried whether I should accept the almost immediate gratitude of my hon. Friend the Member for Bute and North Ayrshire for the £25,000 a year towards research, or whether I should accept the view of the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. George Y. Mackie), who thought that it
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0427">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
was a miserly, mean and miserable effort. Most people who have been sitting in on these debates for the many months we have been sitting, particularly on the Estimates and Matter days, had a feeling, when the Government chose tourism as the wind-up to the Session, that they would hear something rather big. Perhaps we built up our hopes a little too high.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend, Lord Craigton, debating the same sort of problem in another place last year, said that when the study groups looking at the Highlands, the Borders and the North-East and so on had reported, that would be the time to decide whether money should be given specifically for the tourist industry and in what way. It is a little disappointing for many hon. Members that, at the end of this fairly comprehensive study by the Scottish Office, with help from many sources, the Government of the day have decided simply to give £25,000 a year, useful as this undoubtedly will be, for further research. I agree that there is a great deal about the tourist industry which is not fully documented and that a good deal of the information which we use are guesswork and the private hunches of those of us who wander round Scotland, taking part in various forms of tourist activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was said earlier today that this attitude is carrying on the attitude of the previous Government. I would answer that by saying that the previous Government were, month by month, producing big new projects for Scotland. We hoped that at least this week the Government would provide something rather bigger than this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should wait before we make any comments about the reorganisation of the Tourist Board. It has always been an energetic body, and those of us who have met its Secretary appreciate the amount of thought and energy which he gives to it. It has also been a body in a rather amorphous position. No one has been responsible for it, and no one quite knew how it got there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the disappointment of the hon. Gentleman who spoke of the extremely slow progress which local authorities are making over the famous Circular No. 2. This was an effort by St. Andrew's House to initiate some thinking. It was, during
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
the years when I was Secretary of State, and I am sure it is still, part of the aim of the Scottish Office to help any local authority to keep moving. The response from local authorities, considering the importance of the tourist industry, has been slow. I hope that what has been said today will spur some of them to greater efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Bute and North Ayrshire spoke almost entirely on the subject of hotels and the staffing problems. I will not pursue this point further, except to ask the Secretary of State whether he is thinking of ways to help. Can his research team help him in getting the necessary information about the expansion which might take place in the hotel business if the Local Employment Act terms were not limited as they are at the moment? Obviously priorities should ensure that the help from this Act goes first to giving extra employment. It may well be that in this industry, when more efficient machinery is being used, expansion and the expansion of employment are not always the same thing.

I noticed throughout the debate, that a number of hon. Gentlemen naturally spoke about their constituencies, and described how wonderful they were. I only regret that the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland chose this moment to make some rude remarks about the weather in Argyll. I would rather have two fine days in Argyll than a fine week in Caithness. I think that we often do ourselves damage, in the debates and in speeches outside, by stressing the bad nature of our weather. If it were not for the sort of weather we get, we should not have our extremely fine scenery.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) spoke of the problem of communications, getting people to Scotland from the outside, from Norway, in which he has a special interest, or from England. Several hon. Gentlemen and myself are having some difficulty in getting seats on aircraft from England. I should like to speak about the problem of getting about Scotland once one has arrived there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

like me to mention Aberdeen. I will mention Aberdeen and say that it is a wonderful tourist centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary of State talked about the road programme for the next four or five years, and more immediately about the level of the existing rolling five-year programme. He did not claim that he had increased it in any way but, as he rather charmingly said to me the other day in a debate, "At least we have not stopped it." I am glad that he has not stopped the progress of road building, which is an essential part of the whole of our tourist effort. It is a big part, played by the Government in helping the whole industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask him whether he has any information about the problem of sea transport. In the Clyde resorts we have the increasing problem of the freight rates which Caledonian Steam Packet, British Railways, are charging. They are causing a great deal of worry in many places because it is so much more expensive to go by rail and boat to the Clyde resorts than it is to go by special day fares to other luckier resorts on the Ayrshire coast. This is part and parcel of trying to think out an overall tourist plan. When one gets further north one runs into the area which belongs to McBrayne and, as we mentioned in almost every debate, there are still some serious problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We produced new ferry ships last year, but they had a rather short season. I was told in the Autumn that those which had been working for a number of months were showing extremely good returns on their capital cost. In spite of that, freight rates have gone up considerably. I hope that the Secretary of State, or the Under-Secretary, will be able to give us, some day, a picture of how this is happening, because a number of people on the islands are worried that the high rates which may be all right for the tourist industry are crippling local inhabitants, who think MacBrayne's are orientated towards tourism and not towards the people living there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This brings me to a quotation which I am sure hon. Gentlemen read in the last day or two when they received their Report from the Church and Nation Com-
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
mittee of the General Assembly. It was a phrase which I thought had a good deal of meaning. It said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"There is no reason why Highlanders should not put their past on show, so long as they have a visibly living present."</p></blockquote>
This is important to remember when we are thinking about tourism, and it is important for the Highland Development Board, because no foreign visitor will want to tour for long through deserted country. We have, therefore, to match tourism with our efforts in other directions, and to balance employment through the whole year. I know that this problem was being carefully considered by the Highland Transport Board. Perhaps we may have some information about its conclusions.

It is striking that in my constituency, in Mull, a little air strip has been laid out, thanks to help from the Scottish Office and others. I hope that Skye will resolve its problems and will get one, too. I believe that there is a great future for the tourist industry in building these smaller air strips in different places, and getting operators, whether B.E.A. or others, to fly small planes regularly to transport people who want to go to the more outlying and very beautiful parts of our country for a short holiday.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of my hon. Friends spoke about the danger of the tourist industry building glass edifices, thus spoiling the natural charm of the country. To some extent we must face this in certain places. We must think of Scotland in terms perhaps of a country in which there is a recognised tourist route. This kind of thinking has been developed by the National Trust which has done a great deal for the tourist industry in Scotland, working with many others. On this route we should have the bigger hotels, but we shall certainly lose out over the next decade if we cannot, at the same time, guarantee large areas of country unspoiled by the main rush of tourism for people who want solitude—to fish in quiet places, for example, or to put their caravans not on an enormous site but in some quiet corner with peace and solitude. We must ensure that, for such visitors, the Highlands remain refreshing for the mind and soul.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0429">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
It is most important to think out clearly how we want the whole country to develop so that we can ensure that, in certain areas where there are beautiful backwaters, the necessary access is given. This, I believe, will not cause any serious problem over the greater part of these areas but it may mean for some people, who are prepared to allow tourist access to their hills, that the State will have to help by the provision of wardens to look after that access and to see that the freedom given is not abused, otherwise trouble will ensue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The booklet produced by the Tourist Board, the National Trust and the Ministry of Public Building and Works, which lists within a short space everything of beauty which is open to the public, has been of great benefit. This is the sort of advertising given to tourists from all over the world which is the follow-up of the information centres which the Under-Secretary of State mentioned. I hope that the research to be conducted will be carried out quickly. I hope that it will succeed in identifying the places where money is needed and that the Government will not hesitate to put money behind the industry if it is needed, because much remains to be done.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the right hon. Member for Argyll (Mr. Noble). We have had a very good debate and hon. Members have made a number of points on which I know I cannot hope to comment now but which I will take up with them by letter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was glad that the right hon. Gentleman slightly qualified what he said about how much the Government should do. I thought that his remark about my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Doig) was a little unfair. I thought that my hon. Friend made the best speech today in driving home the one essential point of the debate which no party seems to have made up its mind about—apart from the Labour Party. When in power, the right hon. Gentleman said—and it is a classic and perfectly reasonable proposition of the Conservative Party—
	<br><blockquote><p>"It may be asked why the Government do not step in and assist with a subvention from the Exchequer. The answer may, to
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
some hon. Members, seem bitter sweet, but none the less tourism is a properous industry. It has a good growth record. In these circumstances it is difficult to see why the industry cannot itself help to promote further expansion without help from the taxpayer."—[OFFICIAL REPORT, 
	<i>Scottish Grand Committee,</i> 3rd December, 1963; c. 9.]</p></blockquote>
That was in a debate on the Countryside and Tourist Amenities (Scotland) Act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been charged with carrying on the same policy, and that may be true. But the Liberals must make up their minds about the amount of money which they want invested in tourism and why, in public terms, it should be done in this way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The article in the 
	<i>Scotsman</i> substantiates the Government's argument about research. The leak in the paper and the accompanying articles is clearly not a short-term leak but a long-term leak giving the editor time to get his contributions organised; and the article justifies our claim that research must be done. In the article there is a discussion of Easter Ross, which is said to have a tourist income of a substantial amount, running into many thousands of pounds. It gets £100 through the £15,000 grant. The astonishing thing about the grant to the Local Associations in the Highland counties is that, out of the £15,000, they got £2,575.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the Government cannot give money to everybody. We have a limited amount available, and it is to be hoped that places which need money for deserving projects can get it elsewhere. The right hon. Gentleman said that, in that sense, we had not much to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Dickson Mabon</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry but I cannot give way. It would have been wrong for the Government at this stage not to have made a statement on their attitude to tourism. We are reorganising the Tourist Board, changing it from a lay to a more professional body. We hope that, as a consequence, the industry will make a more handsome contribution to the building of tourism than it has made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much argument has gone on about the Irish Tourist Board, but the positions are not comparable. That Board takes in items which we put under other headings.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1964-1965V005P0I0430">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
For example, there is the roads programme which, to a large extent, is influenced in Ireland by the tourist position. Again, 97 per cent. of the Irish Board's income is taken from the taxpayer. In fact, it is a Government board. Is that what is wanted in Scotland? Do hon. Members want a Government board, raising the money and spending it on tourist development and forestry? That may be an advanced form of Socialism which the Liberals are embracing. On this side of the Committee we do not recognise it to be the right solution. It may well be, but we do not think so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry must be asked to help itself. It can do a lot more than it has done, although one must pay credit to those who have worked so hard to make it better organised. For all the cries in the newspapers, the industry has done remarkably well. We hope that it will do better, and to that end we want to carry out research. We shall give the findings free to those who want to take advantage of them, whether it be in market research which appeals to hotel keepers or caterers or whether it shows up particular problems in transport where deficiencies might be met which would be of interest to the carriers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Internal transport has been referred to. It may be that the findings will show that much more needs to be done. The right hon. Gentleman's policy in power was that, after the surveys were done, there should be a complete review of tourism. We have not departed from that. We accept that the Scottish Economic Planning Council and the Economic Planning Board must study tourism as an industry and make recommendations which are financially and economically sound. We shall want to act upon them. When I have met hon. Members about roads, such as the Glenfeshie road, I have always told them that these proposals would be considered by the Planning Council. In our debate on the roads, I emphasised that any new Highlands programme would have to be discussed first in the Planning Council. In other words, we concede the argument that there must be discussion of these things on a national basis, that tourism must be considered nationally and that, whatever solutions are proposed, the Government should be able to see the priorities and take up the options.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
The Tourist Board is being reorganised. I hope that this will make it more effective and perhaps financially stronger. A large sum of money is being given to the Board, amounting to one-third of its budget, and it is being allocated to a specific project—research conducted intelligently and with a certain amount of direction so that we know the kind of answers we want.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Stirlingshire, West (Mr. Baxter) talked about a declaration of intent. I presume that he was referring to the answers which I gave to the ten points. I plead with him and others who think like him to read my speech closely. They will see that it is a catalogue of what we have done. I concede that the Government cannot act on some of the points, such as an advisory service for hotel keepers. All we can say is that we hope that they will organise themselves and that we should like to contribute. But on the specific points which are the Government's responsibility, we have given answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. George Y. Mackie) said that when we came to office there was an application for £212,000 and therefore, because we were giving only £75,000, we were turning down the £212,000. That is not strictly accurate. The Board asked, and with not much justification in detail, for £212,000, in a letter to the right hon. Member for Argyll in August last year. When we came to office we were asked not about that but about the Ten Point Plan, and we have taken up each point in turn and tried to act upon it, at the same time looking into the question of how much money we could get in order to advance the activities of the Tourist Board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps it is obvious that a Minister should say this, but I think that we have done extremely well in our achievements so far. The great thing is that the Board is being reorganised and that the industry is being called upon to play a greater part financially and personally. I hope that the research grant will prove advantageous in helping us to see where investment should go so that, in future, our debates will be even more constructive than this debate has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
