	<p>10.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Minister for Science, Energy and Industry (Mr. John Battle)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I remove my jacket, Mrs. Winterton?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes; gentlemen and, indeed, ladies may remove their jackets if they find the Room slightly warm. Thank you for your courtesy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome this scrutiny debate on the Commission's proposals for a new European Union shipbuilding aids regime, which will be the central element of the Commission's accompanying communication, which sets out a new approach to improving the competitiveness of the EU shipbuilding industry. We have submitted two explanatory memorandums on the proposals for a new EU shipbuilding aids regime and on the accompanying communication.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission proposals are designed to improve the competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry. If there were a banner flying above the Department of Trade and Industry, it would have on it the word "competitiveness", as achieving that is the key challenge that we all face in every area of industry as we approach the 21st century. If the main banner had competitiveness on it, there should be accompanying flags around it, supporting it, on which there would be words such as innovation, creativity, new ideas and sparky brains, because those factors underpin competitiveness. Competitiveness is achieved not by undercutting costs and lowering wages, but by improving performance by using creativity, innovation, new ideas in engineering, technology and other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In "Competitiveness UK", the President of the Board of Trade set out our competitiveness strategy, which will be based on the three pillars of modern companies, an enterprising nation and strong markets. The latter pillar of strong markets—which, in Europe, are still to be built—ensuring fair and open EU markets, is a key focus of the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee will agree that we in Britain have a strong engineering base, rooted in a tradition of world-class experience and quality. That is vital for a successful, competitive economy. I do not want to undermine the word "engineering". Some people think of it as a 19th-century word, and of engineering as a 19th-century concept—as heavy metal bashing. However, engineering has progressed through the 20th century, and advanced engineering techniques will lead our industry into the 21st century. We will have a competitive edge, not least because of
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
the quality engineering that exists now and should be developed as part of our manufacturing base, and not written off, as it has been in recent decades.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shipbuilding has a proud and successful tradition in terms of engineering in the United Kingdom. I have seen first-hand in the past few months the excellence of the technology and engineering in UK yards on visits to, for example, Harland and Wolff in Belfast and A and P Shiprepairers on Tyneside. That excellence still exists, and will carry us forward into the future, provided that we perfect the European regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU recognises that a new approach is now needed to improve the competitiveness of the shipbuilding industry. Subsidies did not deliver a competitive industry with long-term prospects and jobs. Shipbuilding is the last EU industry still receiving systematic and automatic aid—hence the EU's decision in 1994 to remove subsidies under the terms of the shipbuilding agreement of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We endorse that approach. We believe that the Commission's proposals represent a significant step towards that objective and that they will create a sounder basis in the future for improving the competitiveness of the UK industry. That view is shared by most member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our priority is to work in partnership with the UK shipbuilding industry to improve its competitiveness. A key part of that aim is to have an EU aid framework that gives the best prospect of improving the competitiveness of the industry—we do not believe that the current EU subsidies regime does that. Indeed, it can be damaging to UK shipyards because of the distortion to competition which results from the fact that some of our main EU competitors pay higher subsidies. We believe that the rules can be open to abuse and that subsidies simply compete against themselves because much of the competition is within the EU. We have therefore been determined to secure a reduction in the special subsidies for shipbuilding, which we want to return to normal EU rules. That reflects our view that the artificial states aid policy in the EU is not the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Shipbuilders and ship repairers in Great Britain agree with our policy. Although the relevant negotiations are still to take place, I dare to suggest that that policy should be applied across the EU as a whole. However, there is a problem: we have not achieved that new approach to shipbuilding because the United States failed to ratify the 1994 OECD agreement. That is frustrating because the United States is not a major international commercial civil shipbuilder, and it is still uncertain whether the United States will sign the agreement, despite our extensive lobbying. The EU therefore decided last year that, in the shipbuilding industry's interests, it could not wait indefinitely for United States ratification, and it agreed, as a contingency measure, to replace the current shipbuilding aid regime with a new approach, which we are discussing today. If the United States signed the OECD agreement, the system would fall into place, and the world would have a common song sheet—we would all know the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0267">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
The Commission proposes an end to operating aid and a return to regional aid and environmental aid, which operate along normal EU rules, together with new aid for shipbuilding innovation. I must stress that approach, because it relates to the need for new methodologies, working practices and technologies, which will take the industry forward and give it a competitive edge. Tougher rules on restructuring aid will be applied. Only one tranche of that aid—rather than several tranches—will be allowed in future. We must also apply more rigorous monitoring and enforcement, which are essential to secure an internal level playing field, to use the jargon. That will ensure that the system is transparent and that it contains no hidden advantages. UK yards currently suffer from unfair competition because of the misuse of EU rules, and we must stop that. We are pressing hard to tighten the Commission's proposals on monitoring.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The UK shipbuilding industry shares our support for the Commission's proposals, which are the best alternative, in the meantime, to the OECD agreement. There have been extensive discussions between my Department and the Shipbuilders and Shiprepairers Association, which represents the UK industry. We discussed the proposals as recently as Monday when it restated to officials of the Department of Trade and Industry its support for them. Our industry now concentrates on medium-sized specialist vessels. The main competition in that sphere is not south-east Asian countries but the European Union. That is why it is important to get the arrangements right. Harland and Wolff, our largest remaining yard, has successfully diversified away from standard tankers to the high-value floating platform systems. We believe that the Commission's proposals for the aid regime are very much in the interests of the United Kingdom shipbuilding industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accompanying measures set out in the Commission's communication, such as those for stimulating demand by encouraging the use of more short-sea vessels—the short journey vessels—and the replacement of substandard ships will help to underpin the proposed new aid regime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Operating aid in particular is not an effective way to help our yards to improve their competitiveness and deal with competition from south-east Asia and elsewhere. Despite two decades of operating aid, the cost-price gap between EU and third country yards appears to have increased. It has thus not met its objective of enabling European shipyards to match external competition. Furthermore, much of the competition facing UK yards comes from within the EU. We waste precious resources simply to match other EU operating subsidies, of whose value we are not sure. We are thus engaged in a counter-productive, tail-chasing race.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course we recognise the fears that have been voiced about removing EU operating aid without an effective means of dealing with potential external unfair pricing. Questions have been raised by the south-east Asian economic crisis. However we believe
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
that the tough terms of the IMF package for Korea, for example, to reform its financial and corporate sectors, offers the best prospect of getting its shipbuilding industry to operate on a more open, market-oriented basis. That will help to establish fair competition for EU yards. Moreover, the Commission proposals take account of those concerns. There will be monitoring of any potential unfair competitive practices from south-east Asia or elsewhere, under the full range of trade rules. If it is found that Euorpean industry is being injured, appropriate measures will be taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should finally add, as we now hold the presidency of the European Union, that we are making encouraging progress with the EU negotiations on the new aid regime. The proposals are supported by a clear majority of member states and we are hopeful of reaching agreement under our presidency at the May Industry Council. The key issues that we must resolve are the timing of the end of operating aid and the limits to be attached to regional aid. We are actively exploring possible solutions with the key member states. I commend the proposals to the Committee and I hope that we shall be able to use them as a basis for negotiating an agreement in the European Union to improve the competitive prospects for ship building—not least in the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now have until 11.30 at the latest to ask the Minister questions. I remind hon. Members that their questions should be brief and asked one at a time. I am sure that there will ample opportunity for hon. Members to cover the points that they want to raise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Winterton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister has referred to the United States' failure to ratify the OECD agreement, despite its having such a small proportion of the world market in shipping, is he not concerned that the agreement is now more than two years behindhand? Will he assure the Committee that he will give a lead to the European Union, from our current position in the presidency, in putting renewed and, I hope, successful pressure, on the United States to conclude an agreement that would be in everyone's interest—including its own?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. The OECD agreement
	<br><blockquote><p>"respecting normal competitive conditions in the commercial shipbuilding and shiprepair industry"</p></blockquote>
was signed in Paris in December 1994. It was aimed at removing direct and indirect subsidies and establishing a level playing field. Surprisingly, the United States supported the OECD agreement, but has been unable to get congressional support. Congressman Bateman, who represents warship yards, is holding out in the hope that aid for commercial ships might go to the warships yards, too. He is effectively blocking ratification by the USA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) is right to say that the agreement has been held up for two years. We want the agreement to be ratified and will keep up pressure on the Americans. If the United States ratifies, the way will be clear, and I must stress
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0268">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
that the Commission's proposals are a contingency plan in case the USA fails to ratify. Tony Hutton, Director General of Trade Policy, Department of Trade and Industry, raised the matter when he visited Washington in January and we shall keep up political and diplomatic pressure for the signing of an agreement that is in the interests of British shipbuilders.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I repeat my plea for short questions and shorter replies from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rammell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Commission's proposal is clearly an important step forward, but it is essential that there are strict rules for enforcement and monitoring. Will the Minister tell us how the rules will work and how they will improve on the current position?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have time to give a full answer, but any improvement will depend on the provisions of the final agreement. The idea is to improve monitoring and increase transparency. The Commission is committed to enforcement and its methods will be crucial.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's proposals incorporate tougher monitoring and enforcement, stronger powers to verify information provided by member states on restructuring of aid, more information on regional aid and checks on the monthly, annual and quarterly reports that must be provided to improve the information flow. We shall push to ensure that past abuses do not continue. We do not want an agreement to which everyone says yes, but after which nothing happens.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The reports have been written and the negotiations have taken place at a time of severe turbulence in the south-east Asian economies. As Korea already has 21 per cent. of the world market share, what is the Minister's view on the consequences of the recent economic turbulence? What are the chances of Korea taking further measures to stimulate exports or to trade up to more high-value ships?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>. The hon. Gentleman asks another important question. I have already mentioned the importance of ensuring that no extra support for shipbuilding is built into the International Monetary Fund deal with Korea. Currency fluctuations mean that Korea has an advantage and is winning orders against the odds in Britain and across the whole European Union. The pressure is on the IMF to ensure that a deal that helps Korea out of its current economic circumstances does not give its shipbuilding industry an unfair advantage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Americans have only 1 per cent. of the shipbuilding market, could not the OECD deal go ahead without them? What would the consequences be?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we accept the Commission's proposals and the OECD agreement is later ratified, is there a danger that European shipbuilders benefiting from the EU proposals would not want to return to the OECD regime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer is no, we cannot go ahead without the Americans. We need the Americans to sign up, but the original proposals in the OECD agreement are almost identical with what we want from the proposals now. We are going ahead in Europe and hoping that the Americans will come on board. The contingency plans are transitional and if the Americans sign up to the OECD agreement, the proposals will be rendered redundant because they are built into that agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend is correct. As the hon. Member for Daventry said, we must put pressure on the Americans to agree to the OECD arrangements of 1994. If they did so, we would have a world trade agreement and that would be better all round.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement, but I am still concerned. Does he agree that we have seen a devastating, relative and absolute decline in British shipbuilding over the past two decades? Will he use his good offices to promote the interests of British shipbuilding with the Commission, in contrast to the malign neglect of British Governments over the past 20 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have seen a massive decline in shipbuilding since 1945. Britain now has nine yards with only 4,000 employees, so there has been a massive contraction. It is worth noting that there has also been a contraction in Europe where the work force has fallen by 70 per cent. and capacity has fallen by 60 per cent. over the past 20 years. Britain has just over 1 per cent. of the world market, but it is important to remember that we have 17 per cent. share of the European market and Europe has 20 per cent. share. It is important to keep the matter in perspective and to focus on the European Union because our relationship with the EU is more important than the wider international stage, not least because our competition is in that market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I passionately believe that some of the measures in the proposals—to encourage innovation and new means of engineering in fitting ships, techniques of ship construction and the floating platform system for example—could give us a competitive advantage, and enable us to retain what we have now and see it shrink no further. The proposals are important and the industry is by no means being written off.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister be a little less coy than in the explanatory memorandum about his intentions for the shipbuilding intervention fund, on the assumption that the OECD agreement is not ratified? Will he frame his comments in the context of any assessment that he has carried out on the regional or sectoral implications for the various parts of the shipbuilding industry in this country?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We operate two schemes to support the shipbuilding industry. They are the shipbuilding intervention fund, which is the key scheme, and the home shipbuilding credit guarantee scheme. The shipbuilding intervention fund pays production aid to United Kingdom yards under the terms of the seventh directive. The means of delivering the seventh
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0269">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
directive, which governs aid now, is through the shipbuilding intervention fund. The current ceiling is 9 per cent. of the value of the contract vessel or ship—4.5 per cent. for smaller vessels. We expect to spend £12.5 million under the SIF scheme during the current financial year. We shall announce the level of shipbuilding intervention fund support for 1998 as soon as practicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: How well do the proposals fit with the general policy of the Department of Trade and Industry towards British industry? Do they harmonise with our support for research and innovation, or do they take a different approach?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that they harmonise with our approach to research and innovation. For example, innovation aid might cover laser-cutting technology the DTI is providing funding of £55,000 to examine the new laser-cutting techiques—and the science of composite materials to replace steel. Environmental help might cover new techniques of shrouded painting to ensure that the whole neighbourhood is not polluted. We must focus on improving environmental performance, innovation and technology, especially with regard to the engineering skills within the shipbuilding industry. In order to do that, people must be trained in skills. That is relevant to our wider agenda because those skills will become—dare I add—transferable skills, which can be carried over into other manufacturing industries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are moving into new areas of engineering, manufacturing and new skills training, which will give Britain a competitive edge, not only in shipbuilding but in manufacturing industry as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I correct the Minister's statement that shipbuilding is the last industry in Europe receiving operating aid? Has not the coal industry in the Federal German Republic received massive European Union subsidies? Has not the air transport industry also received vastly greater subsidies—operating subsidies in general, as we are discussing intervention funding—than shipbuilding? Could not the United Kingdom invest substantial sums in shipbuilding research and development—as a matter of national policy—along the lines, for example, of launch aid funding for the aerospace industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, we would have to have a completely separate directive. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the aerospace industry comes under separate headings. Although there is a general point behind the hon. Gentleman's correction, it is not true that the funding is contracted or a percentage of the purchase price of a vessel. It might comprise support systems to ensure investment in technology or development of demonstrator projects, which is not quite comparable. I take the hon. Gentleman's point, but the whole purpose of these documents is not to scrap the support
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
system but to introduce a more appropriate focused and targeted system, which will improve our competitive edge rather than undermine it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Dr. Palmer) mentioned, it is important to focus on engineering, innovation and training because that is the way forward. We are keen to encourage other European Union member states to adopt the Commission's proposals, which will provide positive and practical support to the industry. That support will be better than that provided under the first to seventh directives, as it will be more focused in underpinning our competitive edge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister assure us about the social consequences arising from the restructuring that is implicit in the documents? We have all seen examples of transition from one sort of support to another, and the proposals before us must have some kind of social impact on the 4,000 jobs and nine shipyards that the Minister mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report refers to aid to address any social consequences of restructuring. Will the Minister assure us that such aid will be protected and will be an important issue in any negotiations over the next few months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important point. As I said in my opening remarks, the proposals are intended to ensure that the European Union is on an even keel with regard to the normal rules of engagement for support systems, regional selective assistance and so on, which will take into account major industries undergoing restructuring. Any restructuring plan must restore the long-term viability of shipyard employment in a one-off basis, instead of yards having to shut down and started up again as in the past. The wider aim will be to ensure that assistance to shipbuilding is targeted on the yard, which will open up possibilities for other regional assistance. Shipyards are in the main game with everyone else—coal communities, steel communities and so on—in terms of the underpinning of restructuring. That is why the reports refer to that wider context.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the explanatory memorandum attached to the proposals for the extension of the seventh directive, paragraph 2.3 states that as long as the OECD agreement has not been ratified by all countries.
	<br><blockquote><p>"it would be inappropriate for the European Union unilaterally to dismantle its aid arrangements."</p></blockquote>
Will the Minister explain how that statement is compatible with the proposals contained in "Towards a new shipbuilding policy"?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some member states want to abolish all the aid arrangements, but we argue that we should not just dismantle the whole structure and say that that is it when the seventh directive runs out. That is why we have a contingency plan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was opposition to the continuation of aid and people asked why there should be any assistance at all. We said that we should examine whether assistance could be more focused to underpin competitiveness.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0270">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
Of course the hon. Member for Daventry is right; OECD agreement would amplify, on an international scale, what we have agreed in the proposals. But if we cannot get that agreement, we cannot just wait and let the seventh directive dribble out. The seventh directive has already been extended for another year because we would be extremely vulnerable without it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some have asked why we should make any changes when we are under such pressure from Korea. As I think I said in answer to the hon. Member for Daventry, there are other ways of challenging the Koreans, whether through trade arrangements or assistance, but—I hope—through the IMF arrangements. The regime of support and assistance is clearly targeted to improve competitiveness. It is focused on R and D innovation, not on the old contract subsidies. That is what has changed. Some people have suggested that the whole lot should go, but we do not agree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to draw the Minister's attention to paragraph 19 of the Department's explanatory memorandum, which states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"this does not preclude any decisions under the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review."</p></blockquote>
I presume that that is a polite way of saying that there is no guarantee that the shipbuilding intervention fund will continue. Has the Minister assessed what the effect would be on what is left of the British shipbuilding industry if the proposals in the Commission's document were introduced in the rest of the European Union—as a directive—but the Governemnt do not permit the shipbuilding intervention fund to continue in this country? That would create an uneven playing field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot anticipate the result of the comprehensive spending review. Before the election, we said that a Labour Government would operate within the margins set by the previous Government for two years, precisely to create space for longer term planning. The SIF has not dried up and payments continue to be made, but I cannot pre-empt the comprehensive spending review. We have submitted a bid for the SIF and must wait for the outcome of the review in a few weeks' time. However, it is important that we support the transition arrangements because if we do not take note of these documents, the industry will get no support. The hon. Gentleman will have to wait—as will I—for the results of the comprehensive spending review, which I hope will be soon forthcoming.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am in no way an expert on the shipbuilding industry. For my benefit, will the Minister say what the British shipbuilding industry thinks about the proposals?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The British shipbuilding industry is positive about the proposals. Representatives of the industry met Department officials on 24 February and again on 23 March. The industry supports the proposals because it is in favour of a shift in focus away from contract subsidies towards innovation and R and D. It champions that because it sees it as the way
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
forward. All nine major yards, as well as the smaller ones, agree and there is unanimity within the Shipbuilders and Shiprepairers Association, which is lobbying us to press the Commission for an agreement and to get our union colleagues to reach an agreement on the directive. The whole of the industry is behind the Government's approach.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that, historically, the European Union's influence on British shipbuilding has not always been benign. I take him back to the Swan Hunter episode, when the European Union precluded that mixed yard from gaining intervention funding for the construction of merchant shipping. At that time, naval construction was under pressure and shipbuilding on the Wear—Sunderland Shipbuilders and Austin and Pickersgill, for example—received closing down aid, which precluded the Pallion facility from being re-opened. That sort of preclusion persists in these regulations. Is it not a matter of joy that at least the mixed yards—Kvaerner Govan, Harland and Wolff and Vosper Thorneycroft—are able to receive sufficient funding through naval construction orders to allow them to offer competitive prices for merchant shipping?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: One of my hon. Friends mentioned monitoring. Although it is acceptable to put the regime in place, we all lose out if it is not properly and rigorously enforced and monitored. I recall the abuse in the Bremer Vulcan episode in West Germany. That fiasco, in which a vast amount of aid destined for East German yards disappeared and went to prop up Bremer Vulcan in West Germany, had to be strongly challenged by the Government and the Department at the time. That and the Pallion example demonstrate the need for vigilance. We need to strengthen monitoring and to improve the effectiveness of the Commission's role in verifying information provided by member states.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We used to call the European Union the Common Market—there was a notion that, because we had a market, we just needed to be in a union. In a sense, however, we do not have a market, and we are in the process of building one that is open, transparent and fair. We need to monitor it, improve its effectiveness and ensure that information is made available and is checked by experts. All that work must be built into the Commission's procedures. We can establish a regime, but if it is not implemented throughout, we will all be losers. We cannot assume that a level playing field exists but, in building a marketplace, we hope to do the levelling. That hard work depends on clear monitoring to ensure that abuses do not recur and undermine United Kingdom shipbuilding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Following my earlier question, will the Minister provide figures on our trade in shipbuilding and ship repairing, and say how that compares with the world, including the EU and, specifically, Germany? If the Minister cannot provide those figures, will he agree to provide them later?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0271">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can supply some of them, although I am not sure that I have the German figures. The UK's share of gross tonnage is 1.2 per cent. of world orders. The UK's share of world ship completions is 1 per cent. Its share of EU completions is 5.5 per cent. Our share of world capacity is, as I said, 1 per cent. I cannot give the breakdown of Germany's share of the market, but I shall let the hon. Gentleman have those figures in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I take the Minister back to his earlier answer to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)? Is it not the case that if the agreement goes ahead and the European Union countries are allowed to continue to give aid to their shipbuilding industries while the UK, for whatever reason, chooses not to continue the shipbuilding intervention fund, the UK shipbuilding industry will be greatly disadvantaged? Will he assure the industry that, having driven this policy through the EU to allow all countries in it to continue to subsidise shipbuiding, the British Government will not pull the rug from under the British shipbuilding industry by discontinuing UK subsidies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman puts his point well, but I cannot pre-empt the comprehensive spending review. I can say, however, that £12.5 million is being spent now. We shall announce the level of shipbuilding intervention fund support for 1998 as soon as possible. There are only a few weeks to go until the review is published. I do not believe that we would be supporting the proposal if our intentions were not clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting answer, which comes as close as possible to guaranteeing the continuity of funding. However, will the Minister answer my first, hypothetical, question? If the funding were to be removed, what assessment has the Department made of the effect of continuing the provisions in the rest of the EU on our shipbuilding industry in the absence of domestic subsidies?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: When we discuss the comprehensive spending review we shall make the case for each industry, and set out details of the impact of the decisions that will be taken. We know that 4,000 people work in the industry, and we know how many yards there are. We know also the yards' share of world trade—the figures speak for themselves. Our intention in supporting the measures is to improve competitiveness and secure more research and development, and innovation. I was almost going to say to my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) that I am not here to discuss the regional selective assistance that would be given if yards were closed. I am assuming the opposite—that we are moving ahead. I know what members of the Committee are driving at but I cannot give them an answer because we await the outcome of the comprehensive spending review. I am unable to preempt or presume it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As we know, an exemption has been proposed for developing contracts. This is a little reminiscent of the trade-aid packages that, in other contexts, we have tried to get away from. I am a little concerned that leakages of policy may occur, whereby a country that would not qualify would purchase a ship via a developing country. What measures would the European Union employ to prevent that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes an important and significant point. The difference will be that instead of contract aid, aid will be targeted on research and development. Ships are marvellous in a sense: a ship is bought and it goes around, a ship is a different form of trading object, and must be subject to tough monitoring. I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I shall make sure that that important point is raised elsewhere.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I bring the Minister back to the real world? It is all very well to focus on contract aid, but in practical industrial competition the important aspect is total competitiveness. This can include different tax and regional aid regimes, different man-hour costs and ownership. I have in mind the continued ownership of a few continental shipyards that are in the state sector. The same disciplines will obviously not apply to, say, Fincantieri in Italy. It is an extremely productive yard and is now in profit. But it might not be, and the Italian Government could bail it out as they did Alitalia, as France did for Air France and Spain did for Iberia. Contract aid—intervention funding—is only one part of the overall equation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree. There are parallels between Italy and Spain: Astilleros Espanoles is publicly owned. Different regimes and scales of public ownership apply in individual countries. The hon. Gentleman alluded to the parallel of the aerospace industry. We must reach common agreement on the rules of the game in different countries, after which it is up to each to decide whether or not its regime is competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The challenge to those countries will remain, which is why monitoring will be vital. It will ensure that we know where subsidies go and that they are not hidden by being built into the state aid regime. I agree with the helpful and encouraging words spoken in France yesterday by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, who said that we want to deliver a third way between massive state ownership and control and the wild excesses of open markets that are not even monitored—and prove to be closed markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The purpose of these proposals is to tighten the way in which the publicly owned shipbuilding sector in those countries operates to ensure that they apply market terms. If our companies have to operate by them, by implication they are the market rules of the European Union. We want nationalised companies in the EU to abide by them. Monitoring will be crucial in ensuring that they do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I go back to the Minister's assertion that the new European Union proposals—assuming that they go through on the basis of the regulation—are consistent with the OECD code. I am sure that in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0272">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
general intent, they are. But can he assure the Committee that nothing in the OECD code could create difficulty for the objectives he has set out concerning research, environmental considerations or aid to developing countries. Are we proofed, and is the one designed to be aligned on the other? Are they any differences which might cause difficulties?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I tend to think not. Without being exactly parallel, they are completely compatible. The OECD agreement covers the construction or repair of any self-propelled sea-going vessels of 100 tonnes and above for use in the transport of goods. It excludes military and fishing vessels. Under the agreement all measures of support currently provided directly or indirectly to commercial shipbuilding are probibited. They include grants or loans at preferential rates, debt forgiveness and special tax concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The exceptions are as follows: aid for research and development which is the new dimension here; social aid related to closures in the form of assistance to shipyard workers who lose retirement benefits or who are made redundant and export credits to ships in accordance with the revised OECD understanding on the export credit to ships. Even the proposed export credits regime will fit together with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we could get the OECD deal signed by the Americans there would be no need for this to go through: we could accept it and simply say that we are signed as a European Union. If that Congressman holds the whole thing to ransom we need a regime within the European Union. It will be perfectly compatible with the OECD proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on a serious problem that often occurs? The industry is supported under one set of arrangements and we want to move to another better set. The transitional phase is difficult for industries: as they move from one to another there are often losses of skills and orders and yard closures. How do the Government intend to support the industry as it moves from one support regime to another without losing anything in the meantime?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, there is a clear answer to that. The regime is covered at present by the seventh directive which was to have run out but has been extended to allow for negotiations on a replacement regime. The seventh shipbuilding directive has been extended for a further year to the end of 1998 "pending an OECD agreement." We do not have the eighth directive: the seventh directive remains in place. That means that this financial year's SIF can be paid. A transitional phase is built in. The industry knows that and does not fear that there will be a great hiatus as we try to put these proposals in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a technical point, how are the figures that the Minister has been bandying about relating to percentage shares of markets and productivity changes measured? Are we talking about gross tonnage or value? As the industry has evolved, the European industry, and the British industry in particular, has moved dramatically upmarket.
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Therefore, to talk about productivity changes or market share in gross tonnage terms is somewhat misleading and perhaps even irrelevant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The figures that I gave were for gross tonnage. It is important to see how the industry is restructuring itself. The Harland and Wolff yard has moved away from traditional tanker vessels. It now makes floating platforms for the offshore oil industry. There is a great row about whether they are ships or oil platforms. Even if we cannot agree about it elsewhere I should like the Committee to agree that they are ships. That is bringing new work into the yards and new skills. It is a new dimension and new international orders are being won. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond) is absolutely right. There has been a change in character in the work that is carried out in the yards. They are not falling behind because they are sticking with old orders. There has been a restructuring in the industry in terms of its orders and a refocusing to get new work in new forms of activity. That is giving the industry a competitive edge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge might have an opportunity to ask another question in a moment but I am about to call the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The industry in this country and all around Europe expected the OECD agreement to be signed more than two years ago. One must therefore assume that it has already made arrangements to deal with those measures. Why do we need different transitional proposals to allow what are in effect the OECD's measures to come into play? Is there a danger that the transitional proposals will be used unfairly to disadvantage the UK industry? If so, how will the Government deal with that problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not believe that the proposals will unfairly disadvantage our industry—the opposite is the case, which is why the industry wants them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must emphasise the fact that there is a problem only in Congress. Congress agreed with the proposal because it is sensible. The blockage resulted from what I might call the particular political system in the United States. Opposition may have come from one guy representing warship yards, but, as we all know, the proposals will apply not to warship yards but to commercial yards. However, that guy is holding out to try to get extra funding. There would be massive disadvantages if the matter went to the wall, but that is not likely to happen. The regime must be applied, and we must get the right relationship with other EU countries, which will be good for the EU. Compared with the big warship yards, the commercial shipyards in America are tiny, but they support the EC proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I could ask the Minister to answer my question and to provide further information, if he has any. I genuinely want to understand the matter, and his response might greatly assist me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked about gross tonnage and value. The shares in value terms are higher, and the industry is not doing badly. It is improving and winning work in new fields, which is good news. That is why I am bullish about the prospects of the UK shipbuilding industry and why I cannot agree with the theory of decline.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's strictures—at least in part—about what he cannot say about the intervention fund, so I shall ask him a question that may not be precluded by those strictures. What proportion of our shipbuilding directly competes with EU shipbuilders, what proportion directly competes with the EU and the rest of the world, and what proportion directly competes with the rest of the world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We compete with the Spanish and Italian yards, amongst others, and we must ensure that the regime is right because we need to win work internationally. To some extent our debate has been denatured by focusing on Korea, which has put our discussion out of kilter. It is important to secure the EU framework because the main challenges are in the EU. The majority of the competition that our shipyards face comes from Europe but, as I said in response to the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Wilkinson), we are winning orders in new fields, which is good news. The shipyards that I visited—A and P and Harland and Wolff are the largest—are clearly holding their own.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Coaker</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there general agreement in Europe about the need for change? Are we pursuing the matter more rigorously than other countries, or are our European colleagues being as rigorous as we are? Will my hon. Friend the Minister assure us that Britain will come first, and that there will not be a few recalcitrant people tagging along?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without doubt we have gone the furthest, but we must secure our colleagues' support. A majority of member states supports the proposals, although it is not simply a question of being for or against them. We need to resolve the date on which contract aid will be ended and the limits that can be set on regional aid. Member states take different views of those matters—some are for and some are against—but several options are involved, and we must resolve them before signing the full agreement, which we are confident will be done. It would be inappropriate to say which countries support which options or to go through a check list, not least because negotiations are continuing. Those negotiations and bilateral agreements must nudge people along and encourage them to see the common sense in the proposals, which should be agreed at the Industry Council next May.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his response to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset, The Minsiter talked of UK industry moving up-market and referred to vessels for oil exploration, an area for which he is responsible. Are those orders being won on strict commercial grounds, or has the Oil, gas and petrochemicals Supplies Office—OSO—which seeks to guide procurement for the UK continental shelf towards UK suppliers, been instrumental in directing orders to UK yards? Is it that rather than open competition which drives improvement in the UK yards?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: OSO is there to help industry. When the North sea oil industry started, we were told that support systems would mean that only 18 per cent. of the oil industry would go to UK businesses, companies and manufactures and all the other work would go to the Americans. In fact, it is 80 per cent. There are 30,000 offshore jobs and 320,000 on shore, from making sub-sea well heads to building platforms. It is a great success story. There is open competition and I believe that we win the orders, as Cooper Cameron Ironworks has for its sub-sea well heads, because of our world-class engineering. The same is true of the floating platform system built by Harland and Wolff for British Petroleum for the Schiehallion field.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Shipbuilding market is volatile and the word that I have heard used over and over to describe it is "lumpy". Hon. Members rightly press us on the impact of decisions, but it is not possible to quantify the total impact of proposed measures. We believe that these proposals will have a positive impact, turning the focus on innovation and research and development, but that is only part of the story and the industry will have to win orders and sharpen its competitive edge. Neither the Government nor an aid regime can do that job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the light of the Minister's last answer to me, would he agree that if British shipbuilders' main competition is with European shipbuilders, the removal of subsidy, rather than its continuation in the directive, would have a roughly neutral effect on most British shipbuilding?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, it would not be neutral. The purpose of the proposals is to refocus aid away from contract subsidy towards innovation and research and development. There will be positive benefits from focusing on technology. Assistance will support new technologies, which will help the UK industry to get ahead on quality and performance. The proposals will be not neutral, but of positive benefit to UK shipbuilding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>Mr. Battle.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>11.30 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Tim Boswell 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Daventry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had an interesting and illuminating exchange of questions, even if we have not secured all the answers from the Minister that we would have liked—for example, on the continuation of the shipbuilding intervention fund. One element of contention worries me. In his introductory remarks, the Minister spoke for 13 minutes. I have always understood that European Standing Committees were supposed to be prefaced by a short introduction from the Minister, lasting about five minutes. If introductions are to extend to such a length—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The opening statement should last approximately 10 minutes. I was slightly lenient, allowing the Minister three further minutes, but if he had continued further, I would have stopped him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely grateful. As you will be aware, Mrs. Winterton, I am not a regular participant in European Standing Committees, although on occasions I have participated. In view of your guidance, I do not think that the statement was unreasonably long. However, to finish my sentence, if it does become ministerial practice to crunch the question hour, some of us will apply for injury time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been no dissent in the Committee about the importance of the shipbuilding industry and our desire to help it. The Minister rightly emphasised competitiveness. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; I hope that he has learnt from the White Papers on competitiveness of my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) and that that spirit still imbues the activities and his leadership of the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Towards the close of his remarks, the Minister referred to a matter that is clearly set out in the Commission's report on shipbuilding. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It needs to be made clear, however, that the industry's future lies primarily in the hands of industry itself, and it is for management to carry out the actions necessary to improve the competitiveness of yards, while involving, where appropriate, the work force."</p></blockquote>
That seems right. That should inform the attitude of Her Majesty's Government, of other member states in the European Union and of co-signatories to the OECD agreement, to which I shall return in a moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested in the exchanges between what might be called the minimalists and the quasi-, or partial, interventionists. The report does not suggest that Governments should necessarily take no interest. However, the import of the Commission's new proposals and of the OECD code is that that publicly funded interest should be concentrated, or redirected, towards areas of improving the value added, and towards making the industry collectively more competitive, rather than used for subbing existing activities through contract aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his preliminary remarks, the Minister emphasised engineering. I should not like him to believe that the Government have a monopoly of interest on the issue. For some time, I have been a member of the parliamentary group on engineering development, not simply in connection with my current responsibilities. It is worth recording that, as a Member representing one of the most inland constituencies in England, I recently paid an informative visit to Kvaerner, which is well known as a player in the shipping industry. Kvaerner has a subsidiary in my constituency—right in the middle of England. That subsidiary, called Kvaerner Paladon, makes equipment for primary separation, which is typically bolted on. As the Minister would say, that is world-class performance; it is competitive and to be welcomed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, we all start on the same principle: we want to achieve and support a competitive industry. We agree with the Minister that any rolling forward of the existing EU regime, as is now enshrined in the directive, is a second-best to the overall implementation of the OECD agreement. I re-emphasise the importance of Britain seizing the moment and getting the Americans on side, especially now that we occupy the presidency. The Minister has helpfully explained the difficulties to the Committee, but those difficulties should not be allowed to obstruct progress. Strong diplomatic pressure would be appropriate, not least because—as the Minister has said—the United States' shipbuilding industry, which is largely concentrated on naval vessels, is smaller than the United Kingdom's, although ours has shrunk from its former scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other area out with the European continent on which I would like to comment is south-east Asia or, more generally, the far east, and the recent currency and economic turbulence in that area. The Commission's own papers say that if changes in competitiveness take place, Korea if likely not only to cut the price of its commodity shipping—its tankers
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0275">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
and bulk carriers—but to seek to trade up into competitively priced higher value-added products. We must monitor that carefully. We also have a common interest—the Minister referred to paint recovery—in monitoring the environmental conditions of production.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister clearly wants to ensure that British shipbuilding is competitive within the intra-European situation. Judging by Britain's global market share, we are just about punching our weight in European terms if our market share is 17 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is surprising that no one has mentioned the impact of recent exchange rate changes within the European Union. With sterling at DM3.06 or DM3.07, the whole of British industry, or any part of it connected to engineering or exports is, in the words of William Jennings Bryant, a US politician of the last century, about to be crucified, not on a "cross of gold"—which is what he said—but on a cross of an exchange rate of more than DM3. That exchange rate is imposing severe difficulties, and whatever codes are introduced and however hard the Minister tries, if he cannot discuss the importance and implications of that exchange rate with his colleagues, we will have real problems. Assuming that those problems can be overcome, it is vital that any continuing state aid within the European Community should be used appropriately. It should not be used as a device to continue differential contract aid or to distort competition by other means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has rightly expressed his concerns about the important regional aspect, and there are other analogous concerns within the European Union about the application of regional aid. I hope that the Minister will say more about that issue in his closing remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must flag up a note of surprise that in neither our discussions nor the documents has there been any reference to the implications of enlargement. Although memebrs of the Committee might know comparitively little about shipbuilding, they will know that the Polish shipbuilding industry is a major one, and was the subject of some controversy 20 years ago under the previous Labour Government. It is not clear what will happen if those countries seeking membership accede—as most of us hope they will—but it is important that they do not accede in a way that will cause problems to other member states with a shipbuilding industry. That is also relevant to other applications of regional aid, for example in connection with former East Germany. There are also concerns about environmental standards and the passing on—or laundering—of ships through developing countries. I hope that the Minister will draw attention to that during negotiations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another matter that is unclear—it is relevant to the reports issued by the Select Committee on European Legislation, under whose guidance we are debating the proposals—is the impact of the proposals on the industry in the UK, about which the Minister said comparatively little, especially the regional and
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
sectoral implications. He will be aware that the shipbuilding industry is typically concentrated in areas of some economic difficulty, such as the north-east and Northern Ireland. I would include parts of the south coast—Vosper Thorneycroft, for example, is in an area of relatively high seasonal unemployment. Given recent developments concerning the Labour party conference, it is clear that the Labour party now sees itself as a south coast party. I hope, therefore, that it will be more sympathetic to south coast interests. Joking aside, I hope that the Minister will draw out the implications for regional employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the provisions and the new directive will not apply to the fishing vessel industry. I am not clear how that will apply to yards with a mix of fishing and other vessels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know that proposals to restructure research can be used as a smokescreen to smuggle in various types of state aid called aid to research. I hope that the Minister will say more about that. The hon. Member for Broxtowe asked a helpful question that I had anticipated asking: will the Minister tease out more precise figures on the portion of research support that will flow through member states and which will be validated by the new directive, and say how that compares with what will come through the fifth framework programme and from central resources? Tension always surrounds that issue. From my experience in research, I know about aid from a common centre or from national aid schemes. Given that there is a competitive agenda as well as a scientific agenda, it is important to strike a sensible balance which is in the interests of UK shipbuilding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a common interest to make the British industry more competitive and successful. That may be extremely difficult when the exchange rate is as high as it is, and it might be useful for the Minister to clarify the current state of trade and whether orders are still being placed. That is important, although it was encouraging to hear him say that we are able to break new ground and get into new markets in cases with a specialist application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is necessary to discuss not only regional targeting but sectoral targeting. The Minister said that there is a clear interaction between naval shipbuilding construction projects in the American context. Community documents make it clear that the peace dividend gives rise to an inevitable problem, which is caused by the withdrawal of warship building activities. We have heard speculation about what may happen to the Royal Navy's frigates. Conversely, we have seen some encouraging signs for the industry on possible carrier replacements. Clearly that is important, but we need to know more about how that will extend to North sea applications.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall carry on teasing the Minister about the shipbuilding intervention fund. It is, as he said, in place and payments are being made in 1998. The United Kingdom's new financial year starts in two weeks and presumably payments will then be made in 1998–99. The Community's proposal stretches to 2000
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0276">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
and we need to know how much longer it may continue, even if there is a change to a regime that relies less on contract aid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman seems to be running with the hare and hunting with the hounds—while that is still legal. It is not clear whether he favours Government intervention in the market in the form of long-term support. Is he urging the Minister to provide permanent shipbuilding intervention funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has lit on a dilemma, but has presented it in a way that is not helpful to the Committee or fair to me. Any wind-down in the SIF needs to be properly considered. That is very important for contracts that have been initiated or applications that have been made. Contracts may be linked and it is necessary to consider whether they are to be treated as one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the Ministers explicit commitment not to take that approach for ever, but it needs to be run out in an orderly way. If the matter does not come to fruition and we do not get out of the OECD agreement or, perish the thought, the new Community directive, we may, perforce, need to consider matching support for our industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister did not do himself justice when he responded to my hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset on whether the aid would continue. He could reasonably have said—perhaps I anticipated that he would say—that it would continue as a negotiating position unless and until something better came along and others agreed not to provide such aid. There is always an element of agreed disharmony and perhaps the Minister will say a little more about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Stephen Ladyman 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Thanet)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Gentleman was speaking, it occurred to me that the figures in the back of the document on the number of employees in the British shipbuilding industry—I do not intend this intervention to be helpful to the Minister or the Gentleman—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Member for Daventry is the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mrs. Winterton, the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Only 4,000 people are employed in the industry, so given the predicted level of the intervention fund and comparing that with the level of grants likely to be made under regional selective assistance in any other industry, we would have to predict something like a 50 per cent. increase in the size of the shipbuilding industry over those two years to justify that level of grant.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am genuinely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his mathematics. We know that the crude figures that are applied even to the value of regional assistance do not always stack up well, partly because decisions are not always right or at least are subject to challenge, and partly because they take no account of the spin-off effects on other parts of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
industry. For example, if we do not win the contract to build an oil rig, we may not be able to make or offer for sale the separation equipment associated with it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The issues are difficult and I was hoping that the Minister would assist us by saying more, but I fear that he would respond by saying that it is a matter for the comprehensive spending review.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hammond</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend believe that there is a strategic dimension to the question of whether to maintain a civil shipbuilding industry in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Boswell</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, there is interaction with naval shipbuilding, at which my hon. Friend may be hinting. There is an argument—which goes beyond history or sentimentality—for asking whether we would be entirely happy if we were to lose our whole capacity. The Minister may wish to articulate the Government's position on that. Indeed, at this very moment, there is a parallel with the situation in the deep-mined coal industry. We might note the impact of the Paymaster General, who met with coal industry leaders only yesterday. Again, perhaps the Minister will set that in context.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude, there is a common interest in supporting the shipbuilding industry, but as a competitive industry, not as one that is propped up by continuing subsidy, which does no benefit in the long term. That applies equally to interaction with European Community competitors. We must ensure that that is a sensible interface. I am conscious that the Minister is in negotiations at the moment with other member states and it is obviously important to try to secure agreement for the directive, as is equally important in relation to the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are delicate matters, which the Minister must navigate before he provides an answer. In his initial remarks we heard a good deal of rhetoric—which is not uncharacteristic at present—and expressions of sympathy for the industry. He acknowledged that we need to know more about delivery.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.51 am</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin Hopkins 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I support the motion before the Committee and have every confidence that, in relation to the proposal, my hon. Friend the Minister will bat vigorously for Britain. I was going to suggest that he might battle for Britain, but I chose my words carefully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome this discussion because the statistics on Britain's shipbuilding industry, with which the Committee has been provided, show an alarming position. I knew that things were bad, but not that bad. In the past 20 years, German shipbuilding has declined in tonnage by 20 per cent.; in France, it has declined to one third of its previous level; in Italy, tonnage has increased by 50 per cent. but in the United Kingdom, it has fallen to one eighth of its previous tonnage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Minister suggests that we would do well to hold our share, but our share is so small now that we should aspire to greater things and try to increase our share. I am glad to hear that my hon. Friend is bullish, and I do not wish to sound a note of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0277">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
doom, but things do not look good. At present, Germany produces nine times more tonnage than Britain, Italy four times more and Denmark three times more. Denmark is a tiny country but its output per head of population is enormous compared with that of Britain. During those 20 years, employment in shipbuilding has fallen to a thirteenth of its level in 1975. So we have a serious problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In a discussion at that time with a colleague about Britain's membership of the European Community, we talked about industry and trade. My friend said, "What is wrong with British industy? Look at motor cars and shipbuilding." His knowledge was so inadequate that the discussion ended at that point. We have experienced de-industrialisation on a scale that would have caused any other country to panic. We have let it happen. We used to have a massive balance of trade surplus in manufacturing goods. We were the workshop of the world, but now we have a permanent trade deficit, and some people believe that we could survive without a manufacturing capacity. Shipbuilding demonstrates that decline perhaps more than any other industry. The Government must tackle that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will bat well for Britain, but he needs a bigger roller to flatten the pitch enough for us to score a few runs, let alone win a match.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government should view our shipbuilding industry more realistically. We must look to other measures in the European Union and in Britain to promote shipbuilding. Time and again we consider micro-problems, which are really macro-problems. We are considereing a macro-problem this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Macro-problems are economic. Can we provide a serious competitive challenge in world markets when our currency has appreciated by approximately 40 per cent. during three years? Our interest rates are, on average, 3 per cent. higher than those in the rest of the European Union. We cannot compete in those conditions. The macro as well as the micro-problem must be tackled if we are to be competitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister will present those points to his colleagues. My hon. Friends and I will present them in the House. If we are to save shipbuilding and other industries, we must look at the big picture. For too long, we have been feeding the chickens while the horses have been bolting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. John Wilkinson 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ruislip-Northwood)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not pursue the interesting mixed metaphor with which the hon. Member for Luton, North (Mr. Hopkins) concluded a thoughful and constructive speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite our preoccupation with the European market, the market is global. However we construct protective arrangements and assistance in the European Union, we shall continue to lose market share unless our yards compete with those around the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
I wholeheartedly endorse the Government's efforts, which are rightly supported by the Opposition, to try to ensure that the 1994 OECD agreement is ratified. Although it has not yet been ratified, ship repairing, conversion and building in Britain have done remarkably well in the past few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been increasing diversification into the off-shore part of the industry, and into general fabrication work. There are notable examples of phoenix-like resurrections: Swan Hunter, which, to my deep chagrin, collapsed as a naval yard, now undertakes specialist off-shore work; Cammell Laird is beginning to attract attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overarching reliance on the European Union for our salvation worries me. The salvation of our industry lies at home. The effects of European Union membership may not be beneficial to British shipbuilding. Regulations are incorporated, over our heads, into British law, and they are difficult to change and adapt. There are few examples of changes to such regulations. But circumstances can alter, and we may need to change regulations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Union has an agenda for fiscal harmonisation: that was made clear beyond doubt at the meeting in York. It is bound to happen after the euro becomes the core currency for the majority of European Union members. There will be more and more pressure for us to bring our fiscal regime, particularly our corporate tax regime, closer to those of competitor countries in the European Union. It will be argued that we have lower social costs—that we engage in social dumping, as it is inelegantly termed in Brussels. We have, I regret to say, adopted the social chapter. It will be increasingly difficult for us to maintain a cheaper social regime.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Will the hon. Gentleman confine his comments to the motion before the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point is that the matters that I have mentioned relate directly to the competitiveness of British shipbuilding—and of other British industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: What the hon. Gentleman is saying does not seem to hold water in the light of the figures that we have before us. If he argues that it is more difficult for a shipbuilding industry to be competitive in the European Union, how does he explain what is shown by the figures before us relating to Germany? Since 1975, employment in its shipbuilding industry has dropped from 46,000 to 20,000 and it has increased its share of the market by 1 per cent. In the United Kingdom, a figure of 54,000 employees has dropped to just 4,000 in that time. We massively lost market share. If that was due to membership of the European Union, the same would have happened to the German, French and other countries' industries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Wilkinson</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of course, national policy differences have been maintained over the years of the European Union's existence. The Germans have given their industry greater assistance and invested more in it. A national preoccupation has been, in the north,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0278">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
maintaining a viable shipbuilding capability. We have undergone all sorts of traumatic changes: the creation of British Shipbuilders; the denationalisation; the division of British Shipbuilders into naval yards that were privatised, and of other yards; the difficulties about demarcation disputes and industrial relations in the bad old days of British shipbuilding, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are historical reasons for the figures to which the hon. Gentleman alludes. However, we will be allowed to maintain environmental aid under the regulations. The way in which companies meet their environmental obligations will be another significant factor in their overall competitiveness. Regional aid is subject to an exclusion in the regulations. The United Kingdom is bound to be allocated less structural aid when the European Union is enlarged, unless the British contribution is increased. We and other countries are not prepared to accept that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must look for solutions in our own country—according to our capabilities and priorities. I see salvation in the mixed yards sector. The most capable ship building companies are mixed yards, such as Kvaerner Govan, Harland and Wolff and Vosper Thornycroft, and as Swan Hunter and Cammell Laird used to be. With effective naval programmes and if the defence review permits, a degree of support could be given to those yards that would enable them to be competitive in the merchant sector also, particularly if the Government would pursue positive policies for supporting innovative research and development into new merchant shipping design in mixed yards. If the two carriers are ordered by the Ministry of Defence and if the 12 Horizon 2000 air defence destroyers are ordered by the Ministry of Defence they will constitute a bedrock of orders to support the mixed yards and place them in a competitive position. Provided that the Government give support through research and development programmes, somewhat on the launch aid model to which I referred earlier, we shall have an opportunity to maintain, as we ought to, a significant, competitive shipbuilding capability in the United Kingdom. In view of the increased competition in the global market from China, Ukraine, Croatia and Vietnam, to name but four, we must address these issues. I am glad that we have had this debate, but the long-term salvation of our industry does not lie with these regulations, but rather with the measures we take ourselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>12.4 pm</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's proposals and the motion before us. The discussion showed that most Committee members take a positive view of this attempt to bring the subsidy regime into a more sensible context. We all believe that it will be beneficial to the British industry if that happens. Before discussing the content, I should like to compliment the Department of Trade and Industry and European Union civil servants who prepared the documentation. We tend to be sarcastic about Brussels bureaucrats, but the papers the Committee gets from them are often very good; these are particularly good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
A slight air of doom surrounds the shipbuilding industry in Britain associated with the decline over the past 20 years to which others have referred. It is important to stress that the figures in table 5A show that the market as a whole since 1980 has not been in decline; the world market overall has grown slightly. The European Commission believes that the market will soften in the coming years. That is certainly possible, although the expansion of developing countries may lead to some increases. It is a significant market and our experience under a Government, who shall be nameless in the interest of bipartisanship, should not blind us to the fact that there is a significant commercial opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The interesting question raised earlier was whether there is a strategic interest in maintaining a shipbuilding industry in Britain in the same way as there is clearly a strategic interest in not abolishing farming, as we need to maintain a certain amount of home food production. It is debatable: the lead times of shipbuilding make it difficult to think of a crisis where it would be essential to produce ships at home and where it would be a disaster if we had to get them from somewhere else. The defence review may cast some more light on this. It can certainly be argued that a residual capacity is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional importance of the industry must also be considered. It is an employment-intensive industry. Cuts are therefore felt more intensely in the surrounding community. In any specific case one must consider whether the cost of reduction to the community surrounding the industry might not be greater than the cost of support from Government. We all agree that there are different forms of support, and support for research and development is more appropriate than the permanent subsidy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must recognise that regional aid, about which hon. Members and the documentation take a slightly sceptical view, may be very important to Britain. A specific example of that is the location of our largest shipyard in Northern Ireland. Everyone would agree that it is extremely important that the thousands employed directly and indirectly by Harland and Wolff do not become unemployed because of the surrounding situation. It is important everywhere, but the impact on Northern Ireland and on the wider problems of the Province could be quite significant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Minister and his colleagues discuss the future of regional aid and the need to monitor closely how it is to be used, I urge him not to discourage it in principle. Sometimes it might be important. If the present trends in currency movements continue, regional aid would be a welcome option. That would also be the case if we joined the single currency and regional problems developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Daventry that we should not overlook the specific problems of the Polish challenge. The Polish industry is now twice as large as the British one. A large part of the Gdansk shipyard has now closed, but the Gdynia shipyard is thriving. When Poland begins detailed negotiations with the European Union, questions will arise about whether it would be more beneficial if the restructuring and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0279">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
support for investment of the Polish industry were carried out before or after entry. I suggest that the industry should come into line with European Union norms before Poland joins.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Overall, the paper is positive. I am glad that the Committee has discussed it, and I welcome the Minister's enthusiasm for the project. We wish him every success.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Philip Hammond 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Runnymede and Weybridge)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The papers that we have received and our debate have focused on the unratified OECD agreement. There is a general consensus in the Committee that the most preferable option would be the ratification of that agreement. Will the Minister tell us a little more about the OECD agreement? Is he sure that it is watertight? We have talked at some length about the possibilities for abuse within the arrangements currently being discussed by the European Union, but we should recognise that the OECD agreement might not be a panacea. It might contain potential loopholes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister gave us a brief explanation of the USA's reasons for not signing the OECD agreement. I found those reasons rather surprising, as I cannot understand the extension of state aid to naval shipbuilding yards, whose only customer are the Government. Perhaps there is more involved in the political debate in the USA than the Minister has explained to us. Will he tell us what pressure is being applied to the United States, bilaterally by the United Kingdom and by the European Union?

We have not discussed the extent of support, aid or subsidy to shipbuilding industries outside the European Union, especially those in the far east. I am almost totally ignorant on that subject. Will the Minister put our discussions about the European Union into a wider, international context and give us some information about the subsidies that exist elsewhere?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Commission's papers refer to the failure to achieve competitiveness within the European Union shipbuilding industry. We must not lose sight of that fact. The Commission's analysis is that, in the past, the aid regime has hindered greater competitiveness and has distorted markets. The Commission's documents question whether continuing to offer financial support to the shipbuilding industry is a good use of a scarce resource, namely public funds. Productivity growth, which is at the heart of our debate, is still a confused subject; hence my earlier questions to the Minister. That confusion remains unresolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memoranda contain figures that suggest that over the past 20 years the capacity of the UK shipbuilding industry has fallen by 60 per cent. The hon. Member for Luton, North gave a figure that suggested that a much higher reduction in capacity. I am still not clear whether we are discussing gross tonnage produced or value of output.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
The documents state that within a two-year period the Japanese industry achieved a 27 per cent. increase in productivity. Why has the European shipbuilding industry—for which state support has been available on, I hope, a transitional basis—apparently found it so difficult to achieve sufficient growth and productivity to keep up with the Japanese, who made an alarming improvement in productivity from what was already a highly productive base?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister assured us that he would keep up the pressure on the United States to ratify the OECD agreement. How will he keep up that pressure when we have put in place a regime that clearly involves the elimination of subsidies for the EU shipbuilding industry? Will not that remove one of the principal means by which we can influence the United States?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The explanatory memorandum of 1 December states that the optimum solution would be an OECD-wide agreement to eliminate state aid. Does the Minister think that the second-best would be an EU-wide agreement to do so? I have read and re-read that statement, and although I understand its initial attractiveness I am not entirely sure, in the context of the international competitive relationship, that it would be. Clearly, there is a strong argument for eliminating subsidies within the EU with regard to intra-EU trade. However, the United States is obstructing the creation of a subsidy-free world order in shipbuilding. Could one make a case for the EU's taking a protectionist attitude towards non-EU competitors? That would help to establish the wholly desirable longer-term objective of a subsidy-free international trade in shipbuilding. Has that matter been thought through?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 19 of the explanatory memorandum of 4 November refers to an extension to shipbuilding
	<br><blockquote><p>"of other catogories of aid … enjoyed by other EU industries".</p></blockquote>
I understand that, but it goes on to say that that would be
	<br><blockquote><p>"a transitional arrangement before the final removal of special aids to shipbuilding."</p></blockquote>
Does that assume that the other categories of aid that are currently enjoyed by other EU industries, and which were discussed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood, might be withdrawn when the five-year transitional regime ends? to put it bluntly, what is the end game after the five-year period? Will the shipbuilding industry continue to receive aid and support as part of a general arrangement of support enjoyed by other EU industries, does he anticipate that at the end of the five-year period the industry would be truly self-supporting, without further state support?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that we would move to an assistance-free regime under the OECD. That is not true. The OECD proposes a different type of assistance regime.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister for that clarification. Indeed, I said that it would be helpful if he could explain how the OECD regime would work, which he started to do with that comment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The EU documents use rather strange terminology. They speak of competitiveness being improved through extending new categories of aid to the industry. That is not how we generally think of competitiveness in industry being improved. The proposed regime would extend the types of aid available to the industry throughout the EU and would continue to allow a raft of different supports. By the Minister's own admission and acknowledgement, it would leave scope for abuse. As he said, the Government's approach is focused on the need for effective enforcement of the system of aid available. The explanatory memorandum—in the language of the upper IV at Mallory Towers—says that it is vital to stop cheating. Does the Minister agree that in the light of other debates about monitoring activity in EU member states that that expression is essentially one of hope over experience? The big flaw in the proposition is that we may face, for example, a Spanish shipbuilding industry and a Spanish Government who are perhaps slightly less fastidious in their application of the rules than his Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it odd that the proposals include an extension of regional investment aid, which could be used to improve productivity in yards where capacity is increased. Such a regime would operate in parallel with that of restructuring aid, which would impose a requirement that capacity was decreased. Those two regimes might operate rather oddly together. Has the Minister thought through how they will interact? His memorandum notes that restructuring aid has been a major area of abuse in the past. I do not suppose that we have a great reason to hope or expect that that will be different in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand everything that the Minister has presented; I believe that we all generally support the objectives. I am worried that we may achieve a worst-of-all-worlds situation by proceeding with a regime that will not create the climate for the worldwide elimination of trade-distorting subsidies and methods of assistance, but will create a plethora of additional aid mechanisms within the EU that give at least the potential for such abuses as we have identified and discussed. It does not address the strategic EU position on the matter, which should be a defensive posture of the European shipbuilding industry against the rest of the world while the rest of the world—in this case, the United States—fails to ratify the OECD treaty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The more major players in the market must consider what leverage they can deploy in trying to achieve a regime to which 99 per cent. of the world's shipbuilding industry has signed up. I do not have a philosophical objection to giving ourselves the capability—the weapons or tools—to achieve the objective of an international level playing field. That is a correct strategic objective, but I fear that the regime may fatally damage the EU's leverage in negotiation with the United States. Does the Minister really expect that the OECD agreement is more likely to be ratified following introduction of the proposals, or is it that in private the EU is resigned to the fact that we must go our own way with the United States continuing to resist the OECD agreement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Our productivity has improved, but not as dramatically as that elsewhere. Other countries are thinking about production methods, are investing, are working on ship design and are structuring their industries to get the best out of them. That is what we must do.

If we can produce faster ships or ships that others cannot build, or industry will survive and flourish. That is where support for the industry must go. That is what the proposals before us would do.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has made an extremely fuzzy but none the less manifest admission that British shipbuilding is in a market niche in which its direct competition is with
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
other European producers. It is utterly remarkable that the Minister does not know—I assume that he is not failing to disclose what he knows—or has not found out during his visits and discussions what proportion of our shipbuilding industry is in competition with European Union shipbuilding. Nor does he know by tonnage and value the pricing differential between ourselves and our European competitors. He seems to believe—I suspect that he is right although I have no evidence other than his remarks—that we are in a niche in which we are competing with our European counterparts but not with the rest of the world. I am not saying that that is a permanent situation—the Minister did not say whether he thought it would be—but it would be interesting if he were to commission a serious study of the matter. Will the Minister look further ahead than the next couple of years, to see whether the situation is likely to be sustained? Earlier in Committee, the question arose of whether the Japanese industry would move higher up the value chain into our niche, or whether it would continue mass production.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right, and I shall address that issue. The interesting point is not that the analysis has not been fully conducted—although that is a notable point—but that the Minister has brought for our consideration a set of proposals devised by the Commission in the light of an arrangement with the OECD. That tells us a lot about the structure of our relationships with the European Union on these matters.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we should not stretch our tripartisanship unduly. There is common ground between all of us on the point that the OECD proposals, were they to be ratified, represent the best solution. Underlying the proposals is the impetus of Directorates-General IV to move towards degressivity, which is the removal of operating aid. We have reached a situation where the Minister comes forward with the Commission proposal, the DTI issues a perfectly elegant paper saying that it is wonderful and everybody sighs with relief. We are trying to achieve an OECD or World Trade Organisation-type agreement within the European Union, or in the absence of that a degressive arrangement of subsidies. But what about the British industry? What about the British taxpayer? Why is the proposal in Britain's interests if, as the Minister alleges, the majority—I suspect that he would find it to be the overwhelming majority if he looked into the matter in detail—of our activity in this field is in competition with our European counterparts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Why is it in the British taxpayer's interest to have £4,000 a year per job plugged into our industry by our taxpayers? I do not know what extra amounts are to be plugged into similar industries elsewhere in the European Union through our not wholly rebated net contribution and our gross contribution. The purpose is to enable us to be in exactly the position we would be in if none of the subsidies existed—on a level playing field with those who, by the Minister's own admission, constitute the majority of our competitors. That is a wholly irrational situation. The Minister might find that they do not constitute an overwhelming majority: perhaps 40 per cent. or 50 per cent. of our activities are concentrated on competing with the far east.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My reason for doubting that—if I may return to the line of questioning of my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge—is that the tonnage figures are probably wholly misleading. I have not looked into the matter in great detail, and I am sure that the Minister has gurus in his Department who can advise him further, but I suspect that they do not capture a large part of what goes on in British yards. That brings us back to the perceptive remarks of the hon. Member for Luton, North, which were based on tonnage figures. I suspect that tonnage figures do not register a large part of the oil industry-based work, which for certain purposes is not classified as shipping tonnage. I suspect that we are competing with German yards—or other European yards—for oil-based work, and that that is not being reflected in the figures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Hopkins</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point about oil rig production and so on, but I think that the broad statistics that I suggested still show a relative decline of substantial proportions. Given that the last major liner delivered to the United Kingdom was made in Germany, does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is more than a small niche problem?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I entirely accept that, on proper analysis, in tonnage terms, and comparing our strengths and weaknesses with those of our competitors, first, that there is a decline; secondly, that it is a relative decline against Germany; and, third, that we have moved, almost wholly, from one aspect of the industry into another, and away from building liners, for example. Whether that is good or bad is a very interesting question, which none of the papers go into, but we do not know to what extent the activity that has been removed was uneconomic. We do not know the extent to which the industry that has been built is economic, although small, and we do not know whether the industry will be sustainable, in the absence of subsidies, when we move into the OECD regime. We need to know the answers to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Meanwhile, we desperately need to know whether the proposals that we are discussing today are just an exercise in which the British taxpayer is pulling himself up by his bootstraps, or whether it has a rational basis. That depends on the most vital piece of information—which the Minister has not divulged, probably because he does not know—the extent to which we are merely competing with our European counterparts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Palmer</div> <!-- member -->

	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I came to precisely the same conclusion on, I suspect, the same basis of staring at the figures without any extra tutoring. If I am right in speculating that at least the value, and perhaps the tonnage figures, in part, do not include that, and if the employment figures do, I suspect that productivity has increased more than the figures suggest. So we may have a more sustainable shipping industry, which is more able to compete without subsidy, than we thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the answer to the question, "What does the British taxpayer get out of it?", that the European Union has only 20 per cent. of the world market?

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Now we come to my final point. I am most grateful to the hon. Member for South Thanet for moving me on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I began my remarks by saying that there is a muddle. Part of the muddle lies in the question of what are we trying to do vis-à-vis the European Union and part consists of a muddle between two ideas. The first idea is the one presented by the Minister—or perhaps I should say half presented by the Minister, or some of the time half presented by the Minister—which is that one gets nowhere by injecting money into such an industry, and one would be better off with an open playing field and the OECD arrangement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman not want public authorities to put money into training?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Half the time, the Minister speaks as if an open playing field without subsidy would be beneficial. The other half of the time, the Minister and one or two of his hon. Friends argue the opposite—that, in relation to training and research and development, putting public funds into the industry will miraculously improve its chances of competing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wholly disbelieve that. There is not the slightest evidence in the whole of industrial history to support the idea that state injections into industries produce any known benefit. I shall not argue that case today because it is well outside our remit. The Minister has not decided either of the two vital things that the Committee—as a scrutiny committee, not so much debating the substance of the matter as debating how to deal with the issues—needs to consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, he has not analysed whether this essentially creates a higher tax-based level playing field in European industry as a whole, with no benefit to this country. Secondly, he has not addressed the question of whether this sort of subsidy in the European Union will produce net benefits. The hon. Member for Broxtowe, with whom I often agree, described the Commission documentation as an excellent document. I agree in that it is readable and not too long—those are great mercies—but I do not consider
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
it an excellent document because it gives no illustration whatever of why we must suppose that these subsidies—even those for training, research and development, and innovation—will produce good results.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Dr. Ladyman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will give the hon. Gentleman an example of state intervention helping in that respect. A factory in my constituency employs 4,000 people—the number employed in the whole of the shipbuilding industry—making pharmaceuticals. They work there because state intervention in the higher education system makes the factory the best place in the world for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. That is a clear example of state intervention working for the benefit of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Letwin</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am tempted to continue that argument, but I will not. The hon. Gentleman and I may have the opportunity to do so elsewhere perhaps on the Floor of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that is meant to be part of the argument for the document, it needs to be put. But we need to see Commission documents that offer a rationale. It is not sufficient for the Commission to claim that because the OECD agreement has not been reached the subsidy scheme should be retained for a time. Nor is it sufficient for the Department of Trade and Industry to say that the Commission has said that, and how wonderful that is because the scheme will be maintained only for a limited time after which there will be a different type of scheme. We, and the other Parliaments of the European Union, ought to have presented to us a document recognisable—as my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry says from a sedentary position—as a business plan, perhaps, or an economic analysis. But this has not happened. That is not a respectable way to proceed. The Committee ought not to bless the document as if it were something wonderful—as if a great victory had been achieved—when we know neither that it will benefit us rather than our competitors nor Europe as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Battle</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank all hon. Members for their interesting and largely positive contributions to what has been a good debate. It is not a matter of achieving victory with these documents; it is a negotiating position. I hope that we can gather round here in Parliament and take it forward for debate with other member states of the European Union on behalf of Parliament and the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had an unusual debate with some telling interventions from my hon. Friends. Only rarely during my 11 years in the House of Commons has an hon. Member complimented documentation provided by our civil servants or those of the EU. The documents were crystal clear and well presented. We should occasionally acknowledge that. I shall make sure that that message is passed on. We usually offer abuse. I must be honest and say that I am usually the
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
worst offender in not acknowledging the work done behind the scenes. I am grateful for hon. Members' comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has come across during the debate is a sense that the OECD position differs from that of the European Union. I remind Conservative Members in particular that it was the United States which led the negotiations up to Paris in 1994. An internal row has taken place between Congress and the Senate, which I shall spell out further. What is also perhaps not clear is that within that agreement lie provisions for support systems that match our own. There is no question of there being no support whatever, with all subsidies wiped away. The agreement provides for aid for research and development—for fundamental research, for basic industrial research and for applied research and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The OECD agreement would effectively tighten our seventh directive by specifying the maximum allowance aid. The agreement provides for social aid relating to closures, as well as export credits—on account of the revised OECD understanding on export credits for ships. There would be domestic credits to align terms and conditions with those internationally. There would be aid for restructuring—with prohibitive derogations spelt out—as well as notification and monitoring arrangements for the yards, the amount of tonnage, and so on. It is not as though the agreement fails to provide for any subsidy at all. It changes and aligns it, in the way that we sought. We are anticipating all that and putting it in position first.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem with the OECD is effectively the block imposed by vested interests in the Senate. The OECD would support all that we are doing. As I said, the United States led the negotiations in 1994 but it is now holding them up. US Congressman Bateman, who represents the US war shipyards blocked the first US ratification attempt in 1996 because he was worried about credit loans under title X1. He feared that the agreement would undermine the Jones Act, which prevents foreign shipbuilders buying vessels for intra-US trade. He said that it would prevent US defence programmes supporting the construction of cargo vessels for use in the time of war.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Congressman Bateman held out, and last April, the US Administration tried again to implement the legislation; it had some support in the Senate but Bateman held out again and would not make his attitude to the legislation clear. It has now become enmeshed with other Bills.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The director general for trade policy at the Department of Trade and Industry, Tony Hutton, raised the matter in Washington in January. The Commission and the Government are rigorously pressing the United States Administration to ratify the agreement at every practical opportunity and will continue to do so. It is important that we press them on the matter, because without that agreement there will be no leverage on south-east Asia. The problem can be sorted out in Europe, but that does not affect Korea, Japan and other countries. That is why it is important that the agreement should be in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
Hon. Members have referred to the increase in productivity in Japan, but we should watch Korea. New investments in that country will come on stream in 1998. It could be argued that because of the economic crisis in south-east Asia, expansion could be checked or even reversed, but we must ensure that the International Monetary Fund package will not give Korea the leading edge in shipbuilding, although it is important that there is no unfair external competition for Korea. If there is, it should be tackled by means other than state aid. It is for the Commission to monitor the situation and to tackle it under the OECD trade arrangements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friends the Members for Daventry and for Broxtowe mentioned restructuring and the enlargement of the European Union. That crucial matter was neglected in the documents and we must take it further. Accession to the European Union is conditional on countries applying to enter carrying out the same restructuring as existing member countries. Poland wants to join the OECD too; it is reducing its aid in order to do so, and that also implies restructuring. It must be part of the restructuring agreement to enter the European Union.

The hon. Member for Luton, North, in a telling contribution, said that we have to keep the macro picture and the longer term future in perspective. We bandied numbers across the Room and the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood referred to national differentials. I do not want to change the tone of our debate, but it is worth reflecting that the fall from 54,000 to 4,000 workers in the shipbuilding industry happened under the previous Administration. At that time, some of us were screaming for support for Britain's manufacturing industries, but it was not forthcoming; the industries were told that they were on their own. It was argued at the time that privatisation was just asset stripping on a mega scale and that it would give an advantage to the Japanese, who were reskilling their steel and shipbuilding industries, when every manufacturing industry in Britain was doing the opposite.

We must tell the truth about what happened politically in the past 20 years and not let the numbers suggest that the economic cycle disappearing across the horizon was not touched by human beings and by politics. We should not forget that politics drives economics, not the other way round.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to emphasise that we have worked in partnership with the Shipbuilders and Shiprepairers Association. Yards such as Kvaerner, Austin and Pickersgill and Harland and Wolff support our approach, and believe that it will be good for them, not bad.

My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North described the larger picture and interest rates as key matters. When we were in opposition, we did not believe that the pound would be too strong under a Labour Government. History had taught us that Labour Governments meant a run on the pound and a sterling crisis on assuming office, and devaluation
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
and the doubling of the public sector borrowing requirement overnight. After six months, Labour Governments have been practically out of the door.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We anticipated that the pound would sink when we were elected. We accepted the two-year brackets on spending to stabilise and bulwark the pound. In February last year, nine economists wrote to the 
	<i>Financial Times</i> saying that the only thing that one could be sure of in life, apart from death, was that the pound would sink under a Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not take much pleasure from what has happened because the strength of the pound causes difficulties, which will hit manufacturing industry.

The hon. Member for Daventry said that we should pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Henley. I recall that he removed the competitiveness unit when he was at the Department of Trade and Industry. We have replaced it at the Department's heart. When Lord Young of Graffham was Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in the 1980s, and we campaigned on behalf of manufacturing and engineering, manufacturing in Leeds fell from being 52 per cent. to 22 per cent. of the economy. Lord Young suggested that cities such as Leeds would thrive if more people ate out. The suggestion got great headlines. We could not all live on cutting each other's hair and going to McDonald's. We have to manufacture and engineer. The previous Administration wrote off those sectors. We now have to pick up the pieces. That is why those sectors are flagging.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We are making good headway on the proposals and I believe that the outcome will be satisfactory for shipbuilding in Britain. We have refocused on aids to improve competitiveness. My hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman) spelt out brilliantly the way in which we should regard such refocusing as a positive move that underlines competitiveness. It is also a major step towards fairer competition in the European Union and towards removing existing distortions.

We must be satisfied that proper monitoring and controls exist. We shall continue to maintain pressure on the Americans to ratify the OECD agreement. I commend the motion to the Committee. It accords

	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
with the interests of the United Kingdom shipbuilding industry, it will be good for Europe and it might jump start American ratification of the OECD agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>

	<p>
	<i>Resolved,</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee takes note of European Community Documents Nos. 11165/97, two draft Regulations on aid to shipbuilding, and 11167/97, a Commission Communication:
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Towards a new shipbuilding policy (as they relate to new rules on Community aids to shipbuilding); and approves the Government's support for the Commission's proposal to end operating aid for shipbuilding and to focus remaining aids on improving the competitiveness of the industry, as providing a good basis for reaching agreement and fully taking account of the UK's shipbuilding interests, subject to the Government being satisfied that the aid limits and monitoring provisions are sufficiently rigorous.—[
	<i>Mr. Battle.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>

	<p>
	<i>Committee rose at three minutes to One o'clock.</i></p>
