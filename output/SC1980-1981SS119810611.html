	<p>
	<i>Question again proposed,</i> That the amendment be made.</p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Donald Dewar 
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Glasgow, Garscadden)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Committee will be relieved to hear that I was just at the end of my remarks on this matter, but perhaps I might recapitulate briefly to restate the position to myself if to no one else.,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that consideration in the interval since we last met has rather strengthened my conviction that there is no need for this general power of waiver. Having read what was said by the Minister and by some of his ingenious supporters, I cannot say that I am swept away by the force of the examples that have been advanced. I do not want to go into the niceties of the specific scenario that was sketched, but I do not believe that the dangers inherent in the general waiver—the possibilities of abuse—are justified by the example of a disillusioned and distrustful potential parent-in-law determined to ensure that the potential son-in-law shall have no claim in the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Strangely enough, the one that I found most convincing was that produced by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Fraser) when he advanced the possibility of a waiver being signed in order to make good or make convincing a security to raise money, perhaps to save a family business. But I should have thought that, in that event, one would not need to do it by this general waiver power. I should imagine that it would be possible, if security documents were being drawn up, for the wife to consent to waive her interest for the purpose of that security and that presumably would lapse when the security was repaid. That would meet the point made by the hon. Member for South Angus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the other hand, there is the possibility, as we discussed, of the spouse signing under duress, whatever assurances may be obtained at the time, or, in a haze of good will, making decisions which would prejudice herself and her children without realising their full significance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My view is that we do not need this waiver, given the fact that, when it comes to the break-up
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
of a marriage or the disposal of property, under clause 7 there is adequate machinery for waiving consent to any dealing in the property. It seems to me that, if good will still exists, that can be used. If good will at that stage does not exist, then there is a social case for saying that the spouse's position should not have been undermined and alienated at a much earlier date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall listen with interest to what the Minister has to say on this matter. I ought to mention that I do recognise that, to some extent, following amendments would remove some of our doubts. But, even without knowing the Minister's ultimate view on those matters, my intention at the moment is to attempt to persuade the Committee to insist upon the removal of the general power of waiver.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We had some fun at our last sitting with the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury. I assure the Committee that this will be his last appearance in these debates. But, since I dragged in Tory philosophy, by chance, as I ploughed my way through the monumental work that has been pronounced on that worthy, I came across his views on the Married Women's Property Act, and they may be of minor interest to the Committee. He felt that the idea that women should hold property struck
	<br><blockquote><p>" at the very root of domestic happiness ".</p></blockquote>
He said that it might introduce insubordination, or, horror of horrors " equality and something more " I do not quite know what the " something more " would be, but I have decided not to take the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury as my guiding light for the remainder of these proceedings on the basis of those remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (Mr. Malcolm Rifkind)</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that it would be generally agree that everything that has happened in our society since Lord Shaftesbury penned these words proves that he was absolutely right. Whether it has been a desirable or an undesirable development is not for me to say.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have given considerable thought to what the hon. Gentleman said. His final remarks were the most important—that we should concern ourselves with the question of proper safeguards to ensure that any spouse wishing to exercise these rights does so in full knowledge of what is involved and does not act under duress or in any way that indicates any improper activity. It is not right and proper that Parliament should prevent adult members of the community from determining for themselves whether they wish to exercise their rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there is the fact, as I mentioned earlier, that if the subsection were to be withdrawn and nothing were put in its place, that would prevent spouses at common law from renouncing their rights. To that extent, there would be a wider opportunity to withdraw the protection of the Bill than the Bill now provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the hon. Gentleman will consider whether it is right to prevent adults from exercising their choice in these matters. Clearly, it is something which affects only the two spouses involved.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0959">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
As long as they are acting freely and without duress, it is not appropriate to forbid them to act in the way that the hon. Gentleman seeks to suggest. He should concentrate on the safeguards. That is the proper duty of Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have been unconvinced by that reply. I accept that if we were, simpliciter, to remove clause 5, it would leave a lacuna in the Bill. It would almost certainly be essential to write in some provision that there should be no alienation by general contract of the spouse's rights. But that could easily be done at a later stage. There is still a Report stage to come, unless some strange constitutional reform has emerged in the past few days. One never knows with this Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the Minister that it is a matter of balance. But, on balance, I think that we would be better without this specific right of waiver as defined here, and I intend to invite my hon. Friends to vote accordingly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

</div> <!-- procedure -->

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 16, in page 2, line 21, leave out " or a justice of the peace ".</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: With this it will be convenient to take amendment No. 17, in page 2, line 23, at end add
	<br><blockquote><p>" and the said notary public shall explain to the non-titled spouse his or her rights in terms of subsection (1) above before any such affidavit is sworn or affirmed."</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think the ground has already been covered to some extent. These are additional safeguards to which the Minister referred in his closing remarks on the last amendment. Subsection (6), which was added at the behest of their lordships, improves the Bill, given that the right of waiver is to survive. These two amendments would, in our view, make this safeguard more effective. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will look at them sympathetically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second amendment, if I may obtusely take it first, would place a duty upon a notary public, when
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
taking the oath from the renouncer—or should it be " renunciator "?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The non-entitled spouse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The non-entitled spouse—though there must be a word for that. The amendment would place upon a notary public, when taking that affirmation or oath, a duty to
	<br><blockquote><p>"explain to the non-titled spouse his or her rights in terms of subsection (1) above before any such affidavit is sworn or affirmed."</p></blockquote>
This seems to me to be a not unreasonable point. The Solicitor-General for Scotland, in his brief foray into the Bill, to which we shall come later in our proceedings, suggested that this was a monstrous imposition because it laid duties of compulsorily consulting solicitors and taking legal advice. I believe that a notary public should do a little more than merely obtain an oath from the spouse about duress and coercion. I believe that there is some virtue in making sure that, by explaining the rights that are being surrendered, the spouse at least comprehends the nature of the waiver which he or she is about to give. There is considerable difference between merely establishing by oath that there has not been coercion and ensuring that a certain amount of information is available to the spouse in terms of what he or she is doing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 16, which is the easier to defend and may be more acceptable to the Minister, is to leave this as a matter for the notary public alone. It seeks to remove the words
	<br><blockquote><p>"a justice of the peace".</p></blockquote>
I do this not out of any disrespect for justices of the peace, but I think there is a tendency for them to see their job as simply to confirm that the signature is the signature of the person to whom it purports to relate. A local justice of the peace may have no knowledge at all of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Bill 
	<i>[Lords].</i> He may regard this as being somewhat akin to signing a passport form, and he may do it with good will just because he is asked to do it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even taking the rather narrower definition of the avoidance of coercion and duress, this is quite a heavy duty to place on justices of the peace. I think that this is an unfair duty to place upon justices of the peace, given the wide range of people who honourably, but I suggest perhaps inadequately in this instance, fulfil that office. This is no criticism of justices of the peace, who are scattered widely throughout society and are easily available because of the wide nature of the documents that have to be signed in their presence. I think this is more a specialist matter. Presumably waivers would be rare events. Most people—as with divorces— would go through it only once. There are a few enthusiasts, but they are unusual. I would have thought that there was real benefit in saying that it should be left to notaries public. I do not move this amendment in any spirit of trying to establish a legal monopoly, but I think it is a matter of some importance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram
	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Edinburgh, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman confirm from his legal experience that the local notary public, especially in a small community, may be the couple's solicitor and that there could be a conflict of interests? He might be asked to advise on the property and also in the way that the hon. Gentleman suggested. Will the hon. Gentleman also remind the Committee whether going to the notary public in this way would incur any financial burden upon the couple?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I ought to know that, but I do not. I think that it probably varies. I think that notaries would almost certainly be entitled to charge, but I do not think notaries always do charge. That is perhaps something the Minister could consider because it is a relevant consideration. I am sure that the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Ancram) takes my general point and would probably have some sympathy with it, because this is quite an important process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
10.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The argument about the availability of a notary and the possibility of a clash of interests would, I think, have been more valid two or three years ago, when many solicitors did not bother to travel to Edinburgh to go through the mumbo jumbo of paying the fees to become a notary. But because of the affidavit procedure in undefended divorce actions there is now a wide range of solicitors who are notary publics. Indeed, anyone with a general practice must have notaries in the office in order to do divorce work. I would have thought that almost everywhere there would be notaries available if the restriction I am suggesting were introduced. I propose it simply in those terms as a useful safeguard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is an interesting question arising from an intervention. That intervention assumed that this was an affirmation and an oath; that is, that the person who was about to renounce his or her rights would actually appear before a justice of the peace—for the sake of argument if we do not carry this amendment—and there would be a form of oath. A hand would have to be raised, he or she would be put upon oath and the proper form of words about duress and coercion would follow. I do not know if that is what is in the Minister's mind. I suspect that in many cases it might well be what I had assumed, that it would just be a matter of a signed document rather than an actual oath being taken and sworn in that formal sense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Edinburgh, South has rightly drawn my attention to the actual form of words. I do not know where else this would happen. The obvious one is that a justice of the peace administers an oath in terms of the Representation of the People Act at elections for entering the polling booths and so on, presumably for those who count the votes. But if we are using the justice of the peace in a small area where he may be the local chemist or the local retired worthy, the formal swearing and so on might be more appropriately done before a notary public. I should like a little illumination on that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are essentially two points that the hon. Gentleman has invited the Committee to consider. First, there is the question of whether there should be a statutory requirement to give legal advice to the spouse and, secondly, who should be the proper official to be concerned with any renunciation of rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
So far as the first is concerned, I appreciate the reasoning behind the hon. Gentleman's observations. However, so far as I am aware, nowhere else in the statutes would there be an obligation on an adult member of the public to require legal advice before he is entitled to take a particular action which the law permits him to take. I entirely accept the hon. Gentleman's view that it would be very sensible for a person, before pursuing this particular step, to take legal advice. If the hon. Gentleman is correct, it would obviously be more money for the legal profession. However, quite apart from that aspect of it, it is sensible and highly desirable that an adult person who is considering renouncing rights in this way should take legal advice before doing so. But to make it a statutory obligation is completely unprecedented and, frankly, I do not believe that that would be proper or fair.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, there is a second arm to the hon. Gentleman's amendment, and that is the question of whether the person before whom a renunciation is made should be a justice of the peace on just a notary public. I have considered carefully the points which the hon. Gentleman has made in this respect and I accept that a justice of the peace is quite often a person with no legal background who, even if asked for it, may well be unable to give legal advice at that stage of the proceedings. And given that we are talking about a renunciation which is likely to be an unusual circumstance, it should not be difficult on the rare occasions on which such a renunciation might take place for a notary public to be contacted for this purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the question of swearing or affirmation is concerned, I understand that it would require the formal sworn or affirmed procedure. Certainly that would be normally expected, if the statute had specifically laid down that renunciation had to be carried out at the time when the spouse had sworn or affirmed that the decision
	<br><blockquote><p>" was made freely and without coercion of any kind ".</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman was correct. That might be more appropriate for a notary public to carry out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In all the circumstances, I should be willing to advise the Committee to accept amendment No. 16, but for the reasons that I have indicated I do not think it would be appropriate for this one part of our statute law to require compulsory legal advice. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will feel able to withdraw amendment No. 17.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member. I see his point about amendment No. 17, and would certainly not proceed with it. The acceptance of amendment No. 16 is welcome. It helps to tighten things up a little. Would the Minister briefly tell me whether the form of the oath is to be prescribed in any way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<i>indicated dissent.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I see that the Minister is indicating dissent, so it will be left to what one might call the native wit of the notary public in question. Presumably, however, he will have to have some sort of guidance on this, or perhaps the Law Society will do it. There will need to be some recording of the fact, which is a separate document from the waiver, and I would have thought that some simple form of notarised document would be of assistance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that the notary public, in signing the waiver, would at the same time say that he signs it and certifies that the non-entitled spouse has sworn or affirmed that she has made this renunciation freely and without coercion of any kind. That is all that the statute requires, and as long as these words were used that in itself would be quite sufficient.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that is probably a convenient way of doing it. I will not press it, except to say in passing that there is nothing in subsection (5) that says that renunciation, which of course must be in writing, has to be notarised or done by a notary public. I would assume that the renunciation might well be drawn up by someone, say, a family solicitor, who was not a notary, and that there was a completely separate transaction the oath on coercion, which might be done before a totally different solicitor and be a totally separate document. If the Minister is suggesting that it should be like a warrant of registration, which should be annexed, as it were, that might be convenient, but if that is what is in his mind it might be as well if he would confirm it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would have thought that, normally the spouse when appearing before the notary public would be asked to swear or affirm that she had made the renunciation freely and without duress, and the notary public would then merely put his own signature on to the document of renunciation, confirming that such an assurance had been given. There is no statutory requirement to do it in that way, but again, if at any future date anyone wished to found on the renunciation, clearly there would have to be some evidence to support the need that the renunciation had been made freely and without duress. That would have to be shown for the document to be valid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that what the Minister says is eminently sensible. It is just not spelt out. One could have a renunciation which was perfectly proper but not effective, and would be made effective by a subsequent—perhaps at a much later date, when there might be some delay—swearing of the oath under subsection (6).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. It quite clearly says that renunciation
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have effect only if at the time of making the renunciation, the non-titled spouse has sworn or affirmed".</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the Minister. It just shows the value of going through these matters. They would have to be, in fact, contemporaneous, and that gives some force to the convenience,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
although not the inevitability, of the arrangements that the Minister outlined. I would have thought that even at Law Society level there was some virtue in a little guidance given to the trade, but that may be something that the Law Society may consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, I am content to leave the matter at the moment. We have a concession which is useful, and I shall not press on with amendment No. 17.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: I rise to voice my fears and concern about this clause and the particular aspect of it which I have been discussing— the renunciation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that in legislation we should try to encompass everything that is possible. I know that it is not always possible to bring every possible circumstance into whatever it is that we are trying to legislate for. But I think that it is wrong that there should be the possibility of a glaring section or grouping which could be adversely affected by legislation which we pass, and the glaring exception of the group of people who would stand out, to my mind, would be wives who are battered, wives against whom violence is committed by their husbands. I see the strong possibility, regardless of what the Minister has said, of coercion on the part of a violent spouse against his wife which will put the fear of death in her, and she will be coerced—" gently persuaded " is the wrong expression—into saying that she is making this renunciation of her own free will.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will admit that in most areas of matrimonial life it is a good and necessary thing to have a waiver or renunciation, but I submit that, in this section of the community—and it is something to which I am sure the hon. Gentleman's attention has been drawn time and time again—it is no exception in Scotland for violence in marriage to occur, and I think that what we are doing in this clause is to make it possible for a violent husband to do exactly what some of us are afraid that he will do. All of us will have experience, not merely in our constituences or our legal or medical practices, of this phenomenon; it is fairly widespread in our society at the present moment, when, in parts of the world, intimidation takes place so that, for example, the people who are supposed to come forward as witnesses are afraid because they are being coerced into an action which is against their better judgment. I am afraid that that will happen in this case too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am merely voicing my own fears about this. I know that it will not happen in the vast majority of cases. But the minority of cases in which it might well happen—in fact, I think in which it will happen —exercises my mind and causes me worries about the way in which we are trying to protect the woman from the consequences of violence directed towards her by her husband. I merely voice these fears.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>53</span>
be willing to accept that the whole basis of the Law Commission's recommendations and the whole thrust of the Bill is to minimise that situation where-ever possible. It is because in far too many cases at the moment a spouse is at the mercy of the other spouse, is under great pressure, sometimes obliged either to continue living in circumstances which are intolerable because she has no alternative or in other respects is forced to act in what would nowadays be considered an unacceptable fashion, that this Bill, for the very first time, does provide the spouse with certain occupancy rights which can in certain circumstances overrule the property rights of the other spouse. That is a major change in our whole conception of these matters, and it is very much for the sort of reasons that the hon. Gentleman has expressed that this Bill has been brought forward so quickly after the Law Commission's recommendations to this effect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
This amendment was put down merely to allow the Minister to say a word or two about what kind of obligations by a third party he was thinking of in clause 2(l)(c). These are the subsidiary and consequential rights that flow not from any enforcement in the courts or the declarator of an occupancy right, but from its existence per se. Of course, they cover some obvious things, such as mortgages, rents, rates and essential repairs. But the categorisation is important in terms of the apportionment of expenses with or without consent in subsequent parts of the clause. I thought that subsection (l)(c) was perhaps a little less obvious in terms of its scope than the other parts. I invite the Minister to say a word or two about it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am happy to respond to the hon. Gentleman's request. This part of clause 2 is intended to ensure that a spouse who has occupancy of a residence is also entitled to have these incidental rights to make the occupancy meaningful and to ensure that it is not frustrated by peripheral matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's question relates particularly to clause 2(1)(c). I can give him two examples of circumstances which would be covered. First,
	<span class='label label-info column'>54</span>
the spouse might wish to compel the landlord to keep the matrimonial home wind and watertight. Secondly, she might wish to compel her insurance company to reinstate or to pay out money due under a policy covering the home when it has been damaged. Rather than try to envisage in advance every circumstance, it is more sensible to refer to the enforcement of obligations by a third party which that third party has undertaken to the titled spouse. The examples that I have given would come under that category. I hope that answers the hon. Gentleman's question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->

	<br><blockquote><p>" and in making such apportionment the court shall have regard to the respective financial circumstances of the spouses and the needs of any child of the family ".</p></blockquote>
This is almost a conversational amendment. I invite a few words from the Minister. Under subsection (3) the court is able to make an apportionment in the case of payments of mortgages, rents and rates and essential repairs without the consent of the spouse who is not exercising an occupancy right. It does not say anything about the criteria which will be applied by the court. It is arguable whether we do or do not want to- specify any criteria. It is arguable that it is a matter of common
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0963">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>55</span>
sense for the sheriff who may have the job of making the apportionment. Indeed—the Minister will confirm this—it may not need to be an apportionment at all. It can be an apportionment of 100 per cent. Presumably, the sheriff can just say that the non-occupying spouse should pay the lot, and that would no doubt, be taken into account, in any action for aliment or interim allowance concurrent in the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Merely to open up a brief discussion on this matter, given the time constraints, I put down this form of words suggesting that
	<br><blockquote><p>" in making such apportionment the courts shall have regard to the respective financial circumstances of the spouses and the needs of any child of the family ".</p></blockquote>
That seems to be anodyne in the extreme. I do not think that anyone would object to that form of words. I suspect that the attack upon it will be that it is not necessary. But I make one point. Clause 3(3), which is very much related to this matter in the sense that we are discussing the financial consequences of the exercise of an occupancy right, considers the declarator of occupancy and the regulation of occupancy as similar circumstances. Clause 3(3) provides that the conduct of the spouses shall be taken into account. I should not have thought that the conduct of the spouses was relevant to what we are discussing, but the Minister might disagree as it appears in the more general criteria later in the Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I deliberately left that aspect out of the amendment. I left the apportionment purely and simply dependent upon financial circumstances and needs of the children, because it seemed to me that the conduct which led to the separation was hardly relevant, and was perhaps unimportant, given the fact that there was no dispute over occupancy as such. This is where it has been voluntarily exercised and there has been no need to go for declarator.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not know whether it is necessary to put in the criteria and omit the point about circumstances, but it is worth exploring. It is in that spirit that I move the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman said, it is almost inevitable that the court will look at the circumstances in determining any apportionment of the expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a slight difference between clauses 2 and 3. In clause 3 we are dealing with the occupancy rights. Therefore, the circumstances of the children are of particular importance in considering what the financial burden as divided between the parties ought to be. It is rather like dealing with aliment or periodical allowance, and clearly the interests of the children are an automatically relevant part.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 2 we are dealing not quite with that breadth of issue. We are dealing with a specific expenditure which may have been incurred by the non-entitled spouse who has occupancy of the matrimonial home. She may have required the carrying out of essential repairs, which would normally have been the responsibility of the other spouse. Clearly, the financial circumstances of the parties might be broadly relevant, but I am not certain that in such
	<span class='label label-info column'>56</span>
circumstances it would be proper to insist as a statutory requirement that the needs of the children should be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned earlier, for example, making the property wind and watertight and so forth. The division of responsibility on that might depend on legal matters. It might depend on other circumstances. I should have thought it would be wiser to leave it to the court, which would know the circumstances of the expenditure that was being considered, than to try to tie down in advance a particular categorisation or consideration that the court has to take into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall certainly look at this matter further. I am not unsympathetic to the general objectives that the hon. Gentleman seeks, but at the moment I am not convinced that it is desirable to specify in terms the considerations that the court has to take into account because we are dealing with a much narrower area than the general question of the expenditure that flows from occupancy rights, which is covered by clause 3.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not dream of trying to insist on the form of words in the amendment. I would have thought that it would be unlikely that there would be a rush of this kind, because we are dealing in clause 2 with a situation where, very commendably, there has been a voluntary agreement about occupancy. The entitled spouse has moved out and the non-entitled spouse is in occupation, and this has been done without any declarator or recourse to the courts. Presumably, there may have been discussions about who would pay the outgoings. In any event, even if there is disagreement, it might be better to let that be settled by a general action on aliment or periodical allowance than to get too involved in a specific action under clause 2.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am genuinely puzzled as to the yardstick that the courts will use. Presumably, they could take the simple and perhaps over-simplified view that the person who occupies the house is enjoying the house and should pay and, if that person cannot pay, that is a matter for a general financial settlement under other auspices—for example, an action for aliment. Alternatively, they could take the view that this was like an action for aliment and that there should be a general inquiry into all the financial circumstances and a judgment made as to whether the house expenses should be fifty-fifty, 100 to nil, and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two different approaches. I have taken the extremes, but I am genuinely not clear which approach the courts are likely to take or which the Minister anticipates they will take. Is it merely a matter of looking at the house and its outgoings, a general inquiry into the finances of the parties or, as in an aliment application, into the rights and wrongs of the parties in terms of the matrimonial break-up? The Minister may say that it is a matter for the courts to evolve the practice. It is, however, a different approach, and it is worth probing. The Minister said that, in any event, he would think about the matter. Perhaps he will think about these remarks, or say a word or two more now.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that there is much that I want to add at this stage. It would depend very much on the matter under discussion. For example, the court may be considering the payment of rent, rates or mortgage repayments for a particular property. In that event, the financial circumstances of the two parties would be relevant rather than the interests of the children. There might be other matters on which expenditure had been incurred in the house which were of specific relevance to the care and maintenance of the children —for example, the provision of bedroom facilities, or something of that kind. It is not necessarily desirable to specify in advance which circumstances the court must take into account in every case. It seems more sensible to leave it to the court, which would clearly know what was relevant in a particular case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, I shall give this matter further thought. If it is desirable to try to specify it in greater detail, I shall be happy to do so at a future date.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 34, in page 3, line 20, leave out subsection (4).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This, again, is one of a long stream of matters which can be usefully raised. In this case it is very general. Clause 2 deals with consequential rights to secure occupancy. As far as I can see, subsection (4) does not deal with the normal situation with which most of the clause deals where there is an entitled and a non-entitled spouse. Subsection (4) deals with a situation where both spouses are entitled or permitted by a third party. That presumably means where a joint lease is granted, perhaps by a local authority, or where there is joint ownership. In those circumstances, it goes on to say that
	<br><blockquote><p>" either spouse shall be entitled, without the consent of the other spouse, to carry out non-essential repairs",</p></blockquote>
and
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court may, on the application of either spouse, make an order apportioning expenditure.".</p></blockquote>
As this is an application by either spouse, it is presumably without consent, which can be a unilateral application. Therefore, it is quite an important power.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may be being very stupid about this matter, but in a sense this is a surprising insertion into the clause. I understand that the clause regulates what happens as a result of the exercise of a new power called an occupancy right. If for very good reasons, one is giving a spouse an occupancy right to property, consequential obligations flow from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have a traditional law. Joint lessees or joint owners, as the Minister well knows—he probably knows a great deal more about it than I do—have power at the moment to asset their positions as co-proprietors or co-lessees. I am not clear why in that situation, which is nothing to do with occupancy rights of entitled or non-entitled spouses, we have suddenly popped in this power under subsection (4) purporting to regulate the relationships between
	<span class='label label-info column'>58</span>
joint owners or joint lessees. If it is thought necessary to do that, it should be done in a more comprehensive review of that part of the law of property.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a little suspicious, and puzzled, why in a clause regulating the consequences of a new occupancy right, we should interpolate something which changes the law on joint ownership or joint leasing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The simple answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that, without subsection (4), two spouses with similar rights will not be in as favourable a position as they would be if one entitled and the other were non-entitled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman will see that in subsection (4) the apportionment of expenditure will be where the court considers it
	<br><blockquote><p>"appropriate for the reasonable enjoyment of the occupancy rights".</p></blockquote>
So subsection (4), dealing as it does with joint owners and joint lessees, is specifically concerned with the issue of occupancy rights. It is concerned with the situation which will arise when, despite joint legal ownership, one of the parties has been given occupancy rights and not the other.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we did not have subsection (4), there would be an opportunity for an apportionment of expenditure when one of the spouses was entitled and the other was non-entitled, and the non-entitled spouse, who had been given occupancy rights, was incurring such expenditure. Under the earlier part of the clause that expenditure could be apportioned between the parties. But where there were two entitled spouses, one of whom had been given occupancy rights, the same right would not exist for an apportionment of expenditure where what was being done was for the better enjoyment of occupancy rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are concerned only with the consequences of occupancy rights here. It is not inappropriate that subsection (4) should appear in the clause. It deals only with one specific question affecting joint owners or joint lessees, or two entitled spouses. In circumstances where, for the better enjoyment of occupancy rights, certain expenditure has been incurred, the court is given exactly similar powers to apportion expenditure under subsection (3).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without subsection (4) joint owners would be in a worse position as a result of the Bill than spouses who were not joint owners. That cannot be the hon. Gentleman's intention, and it is certainly not the Governments intention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If it is an essential repair, the specific authorisation of the court is not required. If, however, it is a non-essential repair and the consent of the other owner has not been obtained, it is not unreasonable, as the Bill provides, that it should

It would be grossly unfair if, unilaterally, one spouse could incur expenditure for which the other spouse would be responsible, either in whole or in part. If it is essential expenditure, then the specific permission of the court is not required. We are dealing only with non-essential repairs. In these circumstances, it is not unreasonable for the court to be asked to give its authorisation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a nice little point. I perhaps need a conveyancing lesson, though I do not know whether the Minister is the best person to give it to me.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman has perhaps misunderstood me. He said that we do not want a joint owner to be in a worse position than someone exercising an occupancy right. That is not the point that I made. What I said was that we do not want a joint owner, where the other joint owner is exercising an occupancy right, to be in a worse position than a non-entitled spouse who is also exercising an occupancy right. In both circumstances, occupancy rights are being exercised by one spouse. The question is whether, in circumstances where an occupancy right is being exercised, the rights of a joint owner should be less than the rights of an entitled or non-entitled spouse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can see that I shall lie awake at night tossing and turning over this problem. Perhaps the Minister could explain it to me a little more. Assuming no subsection (4) in the Bill and a joint ownership situation, both spouses would have an occupancy right. Unless some interdict is raised in the civil courts, neither of them will need an occupancy right because they have such a right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that one of them has moved out for reasons of convenience or domestic stress and repairs, essential and non-essential—the Minister may have to subdivide his answer—are required to be carried out in one case and, in the other case, are thought to be desirable by the occupying joint-owner. In such circumstances, what would be the position of the non-occupying joint owner if we do not pass subsection (4)? The Minister's argument is that he will be prejudiced and that the position is clear under subsection (4). Perhaps he would tell us what the prejudice would be without subsection (4).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have thought that one could very easily have a situation where, without subsection (4), a joint owner would not have any opportunity to go to the court to ask for nonessential repairs to be authorised. Normally, if there are two joint owners and essential repairs are required, they can be insisted on by one, even if the other resists. If they are by definition non-essential repairs, then normally, if the other joint owner is not prepared to give his consent, that is the end of the matter. The whole point is that, in order to ensure that the occupancy right can be properly en

<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we want that to apply where a joint owner has been given occupancy rights, it is necessary to have subsection (4) to provide for the apportionment of expenditure. Otherwise, only where there were an entitled and a non-entitled spouse could non-essential repairs ever be authorised by the court. That would therefore limit significantly the enjoyment of occupancy rights which a joint owner would otherwise be able to enjoy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a probing amendment in a difficult area in which I do not pretend to have any expertise. Indeed, my amendment is unashamedly pirated—not parroted—from the Finance Houses Association in the sense that I changed it. I took the point from the letter that was sent to members of the Committee by the Finance Houses Association, because I felt that the point ought, at least prima facie, to be discussed, if nothing more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0966">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>61</span>
We all recognise that subsection (5) deals with an important matter—where one spouse owns, or, more importantly perhaps, hires, either by a hire purchase agreement or a conditional sale agreement, some object which is within the matrimonial home and one spouse—a non-entitled spouse for the purposes of this argument—who did not enter into the agreement is enjoying possession of the object concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Subsection (5) very properly provides that the spouse who did not enter into the agreement may
	<br><blockquote><p>" make any payment due by the first mentioned spouse which is necessary … to secure the possession or use of any such furniture and plenishings (and any such payment shall have effect in relation to the rights of a third party as if it were made by the first mentioned spouse)."</p></blockquote>
That is very proper. It goes on to allow for the apportioning of the expenditure on an analogy with the apportioning procedures to which we have referred in clause 2(1).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I understand it, the point made by the Finance Houses Association is that there should not be a situation in which a spouse—a husband—enters into a hire purchase agreement, leaves the home, other spouse enjoys the occupancy rights and does not keep up the payments. If neither spouse keeps up the payments, the hire purchase company may find that it has difficulty in recovering the goods concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an important argument here. Two points arise. First, I do not want the occupying spouse, who is not the original purchaser of the object, to be lumbered with substantial payments which he or she may not want to make. That person may not be able to afford to make them or may think that the price is not worth paying. I presume that the finance house would then be in a position to repossess or to take any action that might be necessary or open to it to protect its position under the original hire purchase agreement. That is a fair and necessary protection for the finance house concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is the possibility of the non-occupying spouse, being the original purchaser of the goods, deciding not to keep up the payment and, application for payment being made. We want to be quite clear that if diligence is done, let us say, for arrears, that diligence will be done only against the original hire purchaser, not the occupying spouse who has opted out for perhaps legitimate and good reasons. It is clear that that would be so, but perhaps the Minister could say a word or two about the possibilities and the rights of action in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the important allied task as to whether it would be possible for the court not to give an occupancy right. Of course, we have not yet reached clause 3. Let us assume that an occupancy right had been agreed and that the non-entitled spouse was in occupancy and in possession of a number of objects which were subject to hire purchase contracts. Is there any machinery for the occupying spouse to ask the court to apportion in advance, as one might say—not historically, not looking backwards. Once that spouse has made payments, could he or she ask the court to say in
	<span class='label label-info column'>62</span>
advance that there should be not only occupation of the home, which has been agreed, but use of the objects subject to hire purchase and to say that the original spouse who entered into the agreement and who may not be occupying shall meet the outgoings? Is that a possibility?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main reason for putting down the amendment is to try to clarify the situation. It is to make sure that a non-entitled spouse who finds herself in possession of objects subject to a conditional sale or hire purchase contract can opt out and not be prejudiced. Of course, if she did pay, it would be exactly the same as if the payments had been made by the entitled spouse who had entered into the agreement. It is important to ensure that, if she decides to opt out, she cannot be embarrassed if by diligence, which I should have thought ought to have been brought against the other spouse. In other words, does the right transfer in that respect as well?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a fairly convoluted matter and I may be having some difficulty in making myself clear to the Minister. But I am sure that he gathers the burden of the refrain and I shall be interested to hear his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I begin by giving notice that, in accordance with the understanding reached with the hon. Gentleman, I intend to move a sittings motion on Tuesday morning to allow for afternoon sittings of the Committee if they should prove necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman has quite properly filled in the background of the situation which is covered both by his amendment and by Government amendment No. 42. I begin by answering one specific point that the hon. Gentleman raised—whether the court could apportion future expenditure not yet incurred by the parties. The Bill provides in clause 2(5)(b):
	<br><blockquote><p>"the court may, on the application of either spouse, make an order apportioning expenditure incurred or to be incurred by either spouse".</p></blockquote>
That answers that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman indicated the background to the amendments and the concern of the Finance Houses Association. The Government's amendment is intended to make it clear that the existing civil law will apply so that finance houses are not prejudice by the Bill. Thus, a non-entitled spouse who continues to use furniture or plenishings in the matrimonial home on which the entitled spouse has a hire purchase agreement will be expected to keep up the payments. The non-entitled spouse may, of course, seek an apportionment order against the entitled spouse in terms of clause 2(5).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, we are concerned with a situation in which no one desires a non-entitled suopse to have any greater rights than she would have had if she was still living with her husband and he had failed to make hire purchase payments. Clearly, that would not only give her an undue privilege to which she would not be entitled in normal circumstances, but would be unfair to the third party,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0967">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>63</span>
whether a finance house or some other organisation, which had provided the original goods that were the subject of the payments. As long as the payments are made, the finance house has no interest in seeking to recover the property, whether they be apportioned between the parties, paid by the husband or the wife, or made in some other way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if payments are not being made, a finance house would usually be entitled to recover the goods. The Government amendment, and indeed the hon. Gentleman's amendment, makes it abundantly clear that if payments are not being made on the goods which are subject to hire purchase, the finance house would have the normal rights of diligence which it would normally expect to incur.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked against whom the finance house would exercise those rights. The non-entitled spouse would not be particularly interested in retaining possession of the objects concerned and therefore there would be no problem about the finance house simply us
	<div class='sup'>:</div> <!-- sup -->ng diligence against the person who had entered into the hire purchase agreement. In other circumstances, diligence could still be exercised aginst the person who had entered into the hire purchase agreement, with the proviso that if the non-entitled spouse could show that the payments on the goods were still being made, the property could not be carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In other words, the finance house's ability to recover the goods would normally apply when the payments on the goods were not being made. That would be fair to all parties concerned. It is on that basis that the Government's amendment was put down, with an objective similar to that of the hon. Gentleman's amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a complicated business. I genuinely am a tyro. I do not know a great deal about hire purchase law. But am I right in thinking that if the non-entitled spouse who is enjoying possession of the goods that are subject to a hire-purchase agreement makes a payment, it is treated as though it came from the entitled spouse? Therefore, she does not become, as an individual, the hirer, if I may put it that way. The husband retains that status and any action that may be raised must be against the husband.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We talk always about " the spouse ". That raises problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us assume that the husband makes an agreement with the wife so that he leaves the house, she takes over the furniture and she will be responsible for the payments. Her payments are as though, legally, they came from him. The wife may stop paying and the husband may not know about it. He may start receiving angry letters, but it is a slightly difficult situation, if he is to be the subject of the court action, although the wife, who is responsible for the payments, is the person who is defaulting and may not be open to persuasion by him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the wife says, "I want to surrender the goods and stop paying", presumably the husband could continue paying and remove the goods from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>64</span>
house. If one surrenders a hire purchase agreement, one may face a surrender payment, because unless a certain proportion of the total has been paid, the firm will re-possess the goods, but will also sue or demand payment of a certain proportion of the total. I am tentatively trying to think through the circumstances in which each party would be responsible. Is it simply that the wife cannot surrender, because she is never the prinicipal party to the agreement, although she may be making the payments and enjoying possession? It is a tricky situation, with a number of options. Can the Minister say anything further?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The basic point from which the hon. Gentleman must proceed is that the wife, the non-entitled spouse, has no right in the actual hire purchase agreement. If the hon. Gentleman looks at subsection (5Xfl)(i), he will see that it specifically says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"and any such payment"</p></blockquote>
—by the non-entitled spouse—
	<br><blockquote><p>"shall have effect in relation to the rights of a third party as if it were made by the first mentioned spouse".</p></blockquote>
As long as the payments are being made, the finance house cannot act differently from how it could act if the entitled spouse were making the payments on the hire purchase agreement. However, as soon as the payments cease to be made by the non-titled spouse the rights of the finance house are identical to what they would have been if the entitled spouse had ceased to make payments on the goods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, although the non-entitled spouse, having no rights in the hire-purchase agreement, cannot formally renounce the agreement, if she wishes to achieve that effect, she simply ceases to make the payments. As for the rights of the entitled spouse, normally the husband, the whole matter can be subject to an apportionment by the court in terms of the liabilities concerned. It may be that if the court were satisfied that a non-entitled spouse had acted unreasonably in that she had ceased to make payments and failed to tell the entitled spouse, and other expenditure became a burden on the entitled spouse through no fault of his own, the court might wish to take that into account in apportioning any liability, but that would not prejudice the position of the finance house, because its rights are as against the entitled spouse, who may claim to the court that he had incurred unfair liability through no fault of his own. If the court agreed it might wish to take that into account in apportioning the liability between the two parties, but that does not affect or prejudice the position of the third party, nor should it, because the third party is obviously not party to any disagreements that might have come about.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister for clarification on the law of diligence as applied to the family, particularly warrant sales?

	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be surprised if that were possible. I would not like to give instant legal advice to the hon. Gentleman, but certainly the right of diligence is exercised against the person who is responsible for the debt. The events that the hon. Gentleman described may have happened, but I am not certain that there is a legal right to effect any diligence against the person who is not in debt to the person who has acquired the diligence. It is unlikely that the circumstances which the hon. Gentleman has outlined would be possible in the context of the Bill. Indeed, I should be surprised if anything remotely like that was possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: An administrative point occurs to me. I am generally satisfied with what the Minister has said. There may be problems that I have not thought of and that would not be surprising, but it seems that there is an administrative problem. If the non-entitled spouse ceases to pay, there may be a tendency for the hire purchase company or the seller under the conditional sale agreement to make its demands to the person who is, in fact, paying at the address where she is living. It is important that, as soon as payment ceases that fact is intimated to the husband who has moved out. After all, he is still legally responsible; he may say that he wants to surrender the hire purchase agreement or, more important, that he wants to keep it up to protect his position and because his wife has opted out by failing to keep up the payments, to remove the goods from the house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What worries me is that a hire purchase company may write to Mrs. X, who has been paying, at 15 Smith Street, and Mr. X, who is no longer at 15 Smith Street may not realise what is going on until substantial arrears have arisen, and the hire purchase company is in a position to repossess, perhaps to his financial disadvantage because he is still legally responsible, Mrs. X's payments merely being on his behalf. That is perhaps an administrative point but it seems to have some validity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: If a hire purchase company wanted to exercise its rights to repossess the property, obviously it would have to carry out the procedure laid down in the original agreement with the entitled spouse, and it would therefore have to be satisfied that he had been notified of the intention so to act.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, if the non-entitled spouse has allowed certain liabilities to accumulate, it would not alter the position between the entitled spouse and the finance house, but it might influence the court in any decision on the apportionment of liability between the
	<span class='label label-info column'>66</span>
two parties. I certainly accept that obviously the finance houses will have to be careful in approaching it in this way, but that does not interfere with the basic desirability of the sort of change covered by the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are two amendments—one is the Minister's and one is mine. With due modesty I am prepared to believe that the Minister's advisers are better than I am at getting the right form of words, and I will not proceed with my amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 36, in page 4, line 16, leave out "five", and insert " three ".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is a simple amendment. Clause 2(7) states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Any application under subsection (3), (4)(6) or 
	<i>(5)(b)</i> above shall be made within five years of the date on which any payment in respect of such incurred expenditure was made."</p></blockquote>
The subsection allows application to the court for apportionment in the various circumstances that we have been discussing. In the case of an application for apportionment of, let us say, an essential repair or even a non-essential repair or a rent payment, a rate payment, a hire purchase payment, there are immense virtues in getting the matter settled quickly and not allowing people to sit for many years and then suddenly find on their breakfast tables a request for payment for something which they had forgotten about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If there is a dispute it should be resolved quickly, and to suggest that a claim can be made up to five years from the date on which any payment was made is unreasonable. Let us assume that I am paying rates as a non-entitled spouse. It seems a little ridiculous for me to be able to do nothing for four years and six months and suddenly say, " Hey, I am going to make a claim under clause 2 of the Matrimonial Homes (Family Protection) (Scotland) Act.". My entitled spouse might have some justification for saying, " If you were going to make that claim, you should have made it fairly promptly at the time and not waited all these years".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
11.45 am
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I tabled the amendment in order to raise that issue. I am suggesting that " five " should become " three ". I am not even sure that three years is not a long time, but at least it gives us some opportunity of hearing from the Minister why we should countenance a very long delay. A little promptitude would be no bad thing in settling these matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In proposing five years the Law Commission had in mind the short negative prescriptive period in section 6 of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973, which is a five-year period, and it is obviously considered desirable to have a uniform period. It may be of interest to the hon. Gentleman to consider the reasoning of the Law Commission. Paragraph 2.73 on page 22 of its report says:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In our Memorandum we asked for views as to whether a claim for an apportionment of expenditure should require to be made within 5 years of the date on which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0969">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>67</span>
the expenditure was incurred. Some of those consulted were against the imposition of such a short period on the view that such claims might not be advanced until a much later date and possibly not until a divorce or a sale of the property intervened. The majority, however, thought that a 5 year period should be imposed to prevent stale claims being made. We agree with the latter view."</p></blockquote>
Therefore, far from the Law Commission considering that five years was grossly excessive, it would appear that the whole burden of the representations put to it was that five years was either right or far too short.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In those circumstances I shall fall back on the usual argument that, if some have argued for more and some for less, five years must be just about right. If, in addition to that, it happens to coincide with the comments of the Prescription and Limitation (Scotland) Act 1973, that seems to be an additional convincing reason which I am sure will appeal to the hon. Gentleman.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I sometimes think that negative prescription should be applied to statutes. The 1973 Act was passed more than five years ago and therefore I fail to recognise the existence of the measure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Commission took a rather surprising view. Things will be pretty stale when five years have passed, and I take the view that three years would be better. It is, after all, from the time when the payment was made. If I were a non-entitled spouse, paying £560 rates to Lothian region because I approve of the admirable services provided by that enlightened authority I would think that, my mind having been concentrated on the expenditure by the signing of the cheque, I should make my claim within three years. Five years is unreasonable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, if the profession and the Minister feel that it should be so, I shall retreat, disaffected and unconvinced, but not wanting to impose a Division on my colleagues. It is something which we shall perhaps rue, but I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>"or if it is just and reasonable so to do, suspending ".</p></blockquote>
This is one of the more substantial matters which I want to discuss and I shall detain the Committee for a few moments as it is a matter of some importance and interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter was canvassed on Second Reading and was first raised by my right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Craigton (Mr. Millan). It is more than merely a procedural point. The position is—the Minister is familiar with the argument, but it should be on the record—that we are dealing with clause 3 which refers to: —
	<br><blockquote><p>" Regulation by court of rights cf occupancy of matrimonial home".</p></blockquote>
The court is allowed to declare the existence of such an occupancy right, to enforce that occupancy right, to restrict it, regulate and protect it. That is fairly comprehensive but what the clause does not do, and it is important in terms of this argument, is to take upon itself the right of the courts to exclude the non-occupying spouse. The gap is filled to some extent by the terms of clause 4, under which a non-entitled spouse may apply for an exclusion order. However, as presently envisaged clauses 3 and 4 are distinct and proceed on a different basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to overdo the point but it is clear that although clause 3 is not a matter of " social expediency "—that would be a pejorative way of putting it—it almost boils down to that on occasions. The court is entitled to consider the financial resources, the needs of the children and the conduct of the spouses in regard to the break-up of the marriage. On the basis of those criteria it has to make a judgment as to what is just and equitable in all the circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In clause 4 we are in a different ball game, with an exclusion order which can be given only where facts are established, to the satisfaction of the court, which are likely to reflect adversely on the non-applicant spouse. Clause 4(2) refers to the exclusion order being necessary:
	<br><blockquote><p>"for the protection of the applicant or any child of the family from any conduct or threatened or reasonably apprehended conduct of the non-applicant spouse which is or would be injurious to the physical or mental health of the applicant or child."</p></blockquote>
In order to trigger an exclusion order under clause 4 one would have to allege conduct which would be in some way to the discredit of the non-applicant spouse. One would have to establish that his activities were—
	<br><blockquote><p>" injurious to the physical or mental health of the applicant or child."</p></blockquote>
I suspect that in many cases that would involve unreasonable conduct of one sort or another, possibly even allegations of physical violence. Although the clause has been much widened since the original private Member's Bill which brought the matter to public notice, I find consistently that many people, even those who are informed in a general sense about these problems, see clause 4 as the protection for the battered wife. Therefore, someone who is the subject of an exclusion order under clause 4 may
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0970">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>69</span>
carry the stigma that though he may not have been battering his wife he has been doing the next worse thing. That is a situation that we have to live with, but what worries me is that there may be a temptation, because of the way in which clause 3 is drafted, for someone to move on to an exclusion order, where the facts have to be stretched very far to achieve that, and that we may get embittering applications under clause 4 merely because clause 3 has been so tightly drawn.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The point about the drafting is the omission of any right to exclude a non-applicant spouse under clause 3(1). There may be an argument about that. In the Scottish Grand Committee, the Solicitor-General for Scotland intervened on this point and said in no uncertain terms that in his view it would be possible, under clause 3, to exclude a non-applicant spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to quarrel with the Solicitor-General, who is by definition, if by nothing else, a gentleman learned in the law. He may argue that the drafting allows exclusion. But it patently does not. We must consider whether the Solicitor-General's supposition should be given substance and whether we should draft clause 3(1) in a way that would allow the court—not on grounds that would attach stigma, for example, that the man is battering the wife or injuring her physically or mentally —merely to say that it has concluded that, in all the circumstances, the de facto situation is that occupancy right exercised by the applicant spouse will exclude the spouse who is a non-applicant, that that fact should immediately be recognised by the court, and that he should be told that he must leave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are a number of persuasive arguments for in favour of the amendment. The intention of the clause—though the wording may be unsatisfactory —is to allow that power. It suggests that after subsection (l)(c), which deals with restricting, we insert:
	<br><blockquote><p>" or, if it is just and reasonable so to do, suspending "</p></blockquote>
the occupancy rights of the non-applicant spouse. I rule out as a common situation the possibility of a convenient division of the matrimonial home. Most of us have only one bathroom and one kitchen in our houses and few of us can look to the comfort of the west wing solution, as we called it in the debate on the principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In many cases it is impossible to envisage an applicant and a non-applicant spouse happily cohabiting. After all, we are presupposing that no voluntary arrangement has been possible. We are not dealing with clause 1 and consequential arrangements under clause 2. We are dealing with a situation in which the applicant spouse, the non-entitled spouse, has gone to the court and asked for a declarator of occupancy. That is bound to be stressful. Even going to the court and asking for that declarator will often be seen as a declaration of war within the marriage. If it is declared and enforced, it does not matter how one restricts or regulates. De facto, if not de jure, the non-applicant spouse will be excluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>70</span>
That may be a messy situation. It may go on for a considerable time with arguing and bickering. The couple may try to co-exist for a while and there may be all sorts of friction as a result. It would be better if the courts could say, " There is no stigma. No one is suggesting that you have used violence or that you have been unreasonable. It is simply a situation in which we accept that we must, on grounds of social justice, give an occupancy right to the applicant spouse and we accept that in doing so we will exclude you from the home." We should make that clear under clause 3 and exclude any temptation for a subsequent exclusion order, with all the embittering stigma that may be attached to it, being made under clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general social approach that will arise in the Scottish courts has already been foreshadowed in the English experience. I do not want to speak at length. I referred to the matter in the debate on the principle. But, if we look at the English experience under the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1976 we see that the English courts have taken the commonsense and proper and inevitable approach, that they will look at the needs of the children, a particularly important matter, and in general at the social justice of the situation, and not get too involved in the conduct of the spouses or the making of moral judgments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12 noon
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rehearsed the position in the case of Spindlow v. Spindlow, a well-known English case, and I suggest that it was particularly instructive in terms of the likely practice in the Scottish courts. In that case the couple were not married. It was a stable union where there were children. They lived in a council house. There was no allegation of violence, apart from one push on to a settee on one occasion, and the only evidence of weight before the court was a statement by the common law wife that:
	<br><blockquote><p>" she did not intend to live in their council house home so long as her ' husband' was also there, and that she would rather have her children taken into care than return home ".</p></blockquote>
That is a long way removed from a clause 4 exclusion, but almost certainly the sharing of a domestic home would merely exacerbate an already difficult situation. Lord Justice Ormrod said on that occasion:
	<br><blockquote><p>" What we have to deal with is the reality of the situation, which is that the two children are in need of a home and are without one ".</p></blockquote>
They were living in unsatisfactory conditions in a relative's house. He made an exclusion order under the 1976 English legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I rehearse that little story, Mr. Gourlay, merely to illustrate the inevitable situation into which the courts will be driven. In exactly the same way, they do not look at the moral conduct of the spouses, at least in terms of the break-up of the marriage, v/hen deciding what is in the best interests of the children in a custody action. They look at what is the children's physical best interests, what are their future best interests, and will not make a moral judgment about who left whom, or who is committing adultery with whom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0971">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>71</span>
English law has been qualified by subsequent cases, and I ought to mention Elsworth v. Elsworth and a number of other cases; but the courts have asked " Was there any prima facie reason why the wife should not go back home? "
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The general point holds about the social judgments that will inevitably and properly be made under clause 3. In those circumstances, if that social judgment is that the applicant's spouse should have occupancy, and if the court is satisfied that it will merely increase the possibilities of friction and that joint occupancy is a non-starter—which I should have thought would almost always be the case when we have ended up in the courts—there is a case for saying that logic demands that the court should say so.

therwise, as I have said, there may be a temptation to elevate that single push on to the settee, or whatever it may be, into an allegation of wife-battering, wife-assault and unreasonable conduct, in order to obtain an exclusion order under clause 4. These are subjective judgments, but it might be kinder in the long run, and better for the non-applicant spouse, for the courts to recognise the reality under clause 3. At least he—if it is a he—will know where he stands. He will know exactly what it to happen, and will not be at the risk of having allegations " manufactured ". That is too strong a word. There will be no danger of the temptation of getting an exclusion order leading to unimportant things being made to appear important in order to meet the criteria which apply in clause 4(2).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that this is a difficult point, and that it may appear to be an anti-non-applicant spouse point. If so, I am sorry. It is not meant to be, and I am sensitive to the fact that when one is trying to adjust these matters, someone will always be hurt. We are certainly swinging the pendulum back against the previous massive injustice for wives in terms of occupancy and property rights, and we are all 100 per cent, united in doing that. We also all recognise that there will be occasions when the husband will feel aggrieved, and that is inevitable. Honest judgments will have to be made in difficult circumstances by sheriffs and by senators of the College of Justice. It may be that I shall be seen as exacerbating the situation, but in fact I am attempting to make it tidier, more logical, more manageable and more reasonable. It is very much in that mood that I approach the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under clause 3(4) the court has the power on application to make an interim order, and it is either necessary or it can simply be expedient if the court can make an order in relation to the residence of the spouse in the home. That seemed to me first of all to be a very wide power, and one of the points regulating a resident might be that he cannot reside there.

	<span class='label label-info column'>72</span>
be prayed in aid both ways. I have not given enough attention to this power. It is an interim power and one tends to hop over it when considering the main provisions of the clause. But if one assumes that the courts would be in a position, on the ground of expediency, to say that the non-applicant spouse shall not live in the matrimonial home, that would certainly take care of an initial period of friction and might be useful for that purpose. But let us postulate that they say—and this is, after all, only interim—when the final occupancy right is declared, that that particular part of the judgment then fails and must lapse. I should have thought that, at that point, the man might say, " I shall return to the matrimonial home. After all, I still have occupancy rights. No one has suspended them". If it is expedient on an interim order to say that he shall not live in the house, I think that there is a case for saying that, when we supersede that interim order by declarator under clause 3(1), at that stage there should be a possibility not of ending the occupancy rights of the non-applicant spouse, because that would be very serious, but that there should at least be a possibility of excluding them or putting them into a state of limbo for the purpose of the final declarator. The hon. Member has made a good point but, if that particular provision appears on the interim basis under subsection (4), I am not sure that it should not be included in the general line of argument that I have advanced under subsection (1). It is a difficult matter, a matter of balance, but I believe that there is a strong logic behind what I am saying, and I do not believe that it should be seen as an attempt further to disadvantage a non-applicant spouse in the very difficult situations on which courts will have to adjudicate when the parties, sadly, have reached such a state of non-co-operation that they have to have recourse to the law in order to settle the matter of occupancy. I shall obviously be interested in what the Minister has to say, but it a serious point that deserves serious consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has rightly drawn attention to a very important area of the Bill, and in particular the relationship between clauses 3 and 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that the hon. Gentleman would agree, as I am sure would the Committee, that the introduction of exclusion orders under clause 4 is perhaps the single most important part of the Bill. For the very first time, a person who is undoubtedly the owner of the property may, in certain circumstances, be excluded from his right to occupy that property. That is a very significant and important introduction, and it is certainly right and proper that the exercise of such a restriction should only apply in very special circumstances and with the safeguards that have been specified.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main concern of the hon. Gentleman both during the Grand Committee debate and in the background of his own amendment has been that the particular reference in clause 3 enabling the courts to restrict the occupancy rights of an entitled spouse might, in effect, have the same consequence as an exclusion order under clause 4. He has put down
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0972">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>73</span>
a specific alternative amendment that enables the court, if it thinks appropriate, not only to restrict but, if it thinks it just and reasonable, to suspend the occupancy rights of the entitled spouse. I think that the hon. Gentleman would accept that in most circumstances, if such a suspension were to be imposed by the court, that would have the same effect as an exclusion order under clause 4. Frankly, I would have thought that that was an unsatisfactory way to proceed. If, in effect, we are contemplating the exclusion of an entitled spouse, then it is right and proper that it should be done under clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is right and proper that if an entitled spouse is, in effect, to be excluded from the house which he owns, and to which he has a legal title, then clause 4 is the appropriate clause under which any such application should be made. If, however, we are talking about a restriction on the rights of the entitled spouse which falls short of exclusion, then that should be done under clause 3, and it is certainly desirable to ensure that the terms of clause 3 have just such an effect, and no greater effect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that a wide definition of the meaning of " restrict" might, in effect, have the same consequences as an exclusion order. But, if I am asked, I have to say that that is not the policy intention behind the drafting of the clause. If, on the other hand, I am asked whether that is a possible consequence, given the existing drafting, then I would have to accept that it might just be so. We shall clearly have to consider carefully whether the wording is acceptable in its present form. It may be sufficient to write into clause 3 a proviso that no restriction or other qualification of the right of an entitled spouse shall be such as to have an effect similar to that of an exclusion order. That may be one way of approaching this matter. A proviso of that kind might be sufficient to ensure that the courts do not interpret this to mean the exclusion of an entitled spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Whether we do it in that or some other way, I am certainly prepared to give an undertaking to look at this matter very closely with a view to ensuring that clause 3 shall not be used to achieve what would, in effect, amount to an exclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman might ask whether, if there is agreement that clause 3 should not amount to an exclusion, it is necessary to keep the option of restriction of rights in the clause at all. That is clearly something that we would want to look at, but I think there are circumstances in which it might be appropriate. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right in saying that in the vast majority of houses, which are relatively small matrimonial homes, any restriction worthy of the term would be difficult to conceive as being a realistic option for the courts and would not be likely to appeal to them. However, there are people who live in much larger houses of two or three storeys, often with different bathroom facilites. Therefore, it does not seem undesirable for the courts at least to have the opportunity—in circumstances where that sort of matrimonial home exists—to contemplate a restriction that does not amount to an exclusion order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>74</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Fraser</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In view of what my hon. Friend has said, that the term " restriction " is not meant to amount to exclusion—he has given us the example of the large house, the west wing solution, or whatever one wishes to call it—what distinction is there between paragraphs (c) and 
	<i>{d)</i> which refer to "restricting" and "regulating"? The examples that both he and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) have used could, I think, be covered simply by the term " regulation "—for example, that the entitled spouse was permitted only to move about the west wing of the house. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that we do not get caught up with the phrase " the west wing solution ". That implies that a possible option only if we are talking about some vast mansion of a kind which clearly is relevant only to a tiny fraction of the population. I am more concerned with what often happens with a detached house or large flat, as is the case in many parts of Edinburgh. Several floors may make up a single matrimonial home. Each floor might have bathroom facilities. There is sometimes more than one entrance to the building. A house, which by no stretch of the imagination could be called a mansion and which did not have separate wings, could have the capacity for subdivision, which might be appropriate in certain circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other question my hon. Friend asked was about the difference between regulating and restricting. It is not inconceivable that, in the situation that I have envisaged, if there was only one kitchen but the house was very large and had several storeys, the regulation might be that one spouse should use the kitchen only at certain times of the day and the other spouse at other times of the day. Frankly, I do not see that happening often. It would not be an attractive solution, but the parties might find it perfectly acceptable if the suggestion came from the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to narrow the options available to the court because, particularly in matrimonial matters, whenever one tries to envisage in legislative form every circumstances that might arise, one invariably gets it wrong and introduces a rigidity which is not appropriate to the relationship between ordinary individuals. Therefore, the main objective is to allow flexibility. The proper drafting of the clause should be such as to determine the parameters of flexibility rather than to define how the court must act in each case. If we ensure that it is drafted in such a way that it will not amount to exclusion of a spouse—that should be done under clase 4, if it to be done at all—it is right, within that parameter, for the court to have the maximum flexibility. That is why this fairly wide choice of words has been put into the clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I freely accept that we could choose either " regulating " or " restricting", and certainly we could give further thought to that aspect. I am anxious to allow the court maximum flexibility to do whatever is appropriate as long it does not amount to an exclusion order. If that is the criterion, it is a common sense approach to these issues. If we become too involved in the particular words used,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0973">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>75</span>
which fall short of exclusion, we shall introduce a degree of rigidity which will not be in the interests of either of the parties and may make the court's task more difficult in a minority of cases. That is the basis on which I approach the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should certainly want to look closely at clause 3 with a view to a possible amendment to ensure that an exclusion order could not arose as a consequence of its use. I do not think that the amendment would achieve that effect. It would have the opposite effect of confirming that what, in effect, was an exclusion might be utilised under clause 3. I should have thought that on that basis the hon. Gentleman might not wish to press it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting assumption and totally correct, but totally correct for very different reasons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This has been an interesting debate on a matter of genuine importance which strikes at the whole philisophy of the Bill. The difficulty is that the Under-Secretary is arguing a case exactly opposite to the one that I was arguing. Indeed, the amendment moves in a diametrically opposite direction from what he has been saying. I think that there is a case for moving in a diametrically opposite direction, although I know that there are difficulties in either course of action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The difficulty about clause 3(1) is that it is a messy compromise which gives comfort to either philosophy. The Minister may be right that it should be looked at, and I am grateful for that undertaking. But I am not entirely happy with the idea that an order under clause 3(1), declaring, enforcing, restricting, regulating and protecting an occupancy right should not ever amount to exclusion. There should perhaps be amendments to make that clear. The Solicitor-General for Scotland actually thought that it could amount to an exclusion order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General for Scotland is quite right that, under the present wording, it might, in effect, amount to an exclusion order. What I am saying is that it is the Government's policy objective that it should not, and that is why an amendment may be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>:I got the impression that the Solicitor-General for Scotland said with great force that, of course, it could amount to an exclusion order. He was saying not that only it could but that it should. But we will leave that particular fly sticking to the wall, if that is not an improper way of referring to a judge. I am sorry—a Law Officer. I anticipate history, perhaps.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is hopelessly optimistic to say that clause 3(1), even redrafted by the Under-Secretary, will not amount to an exclusion order in real terms. It may be that the right of occupancy of the non-applicant spouse will survive anything that is done under the various subsections of clause 1 in a legal sense. But the very fact that one lives in a two-up, two-down semi-detached house and that relations with one's spouse are so bad that both have ended up in the
	<span class='label label-info column'>76</span>
courts arguing about occupancy suggests to me that the reality is that, no matter how ingeniously the court acts—whether it produces an agreement about time sharing in the bathroom and the kitchen, which would be worthy of the most enthusiastic holiday operator or flexitime—it is likely to be nothing less than an effective exclusion order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I am on bad terms with my wife and we have had an argument in the courts about her right to continue to live in the house, the fact that I am told that I can use the bathroom between 10 and 12 o'clock and she can use it between 6 and 7 o'clock or that I can have a slice of the kitchen at one time and she can have it at another time, will not be totally workable. For example, it will be little consolation to me if she, wearing only her underclothing, wanders into the middle of my slice of kitchen time to make her bacon butty. This will be a constant aggravation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What I am saying—perhaps rather flippantly but with serious intent—is that, however we tinker with clause 3(1), in practical terms it will amount to the virtual exclusion of the non-applicant spouse. He has obviously refused to allow his wife adequate occupancy; otherwise, she would not have had to go to the courts. She now has occupancy. The effect of that will be that he will almost certainly stay in the house exercising his right, except in exceptional circumstances, with the result of increasing friction, or he will have to go, hook, line and sinker, bag and baggage from the house. I am sure that I am allowed a mixed metaphor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of the day I am saying that there must be a case for the courts recognising and not obliterating but at least suspending under clause 3(1), as they can under clause 3(4) on an interim basis, the right of occupancy. Happily, there will be occasions when they will not think that is necessary. There will be occasions when parties will be able to coexist under the same roof when the house lends itself to division and so on. But where the courts have to give an occupancy right to the wife and children, because justice and social convenience demand it, the whole history suggests that to pretend that there can be co-existing occupancy rights is nonsense. Instead of forcing the wife to go to court under clause 4, surely there is something to be said for amending clause 3(1) in the opposite direction from the way in which the Minister intends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can flog this argument for some time. I have certainly said enough. I hope that the Minister will look at this matter closely. Other members of the Committee may want to join in the debate. We can come back to it on Report when we see what changes the Minister proposes. It is not that my amendment is defective. The Minister will produce something better. The Minister wants to move away from what I have been suggesting. However, I hope that he will at least take a second look at the possibilities that I have outlined. To suggest that we can have joint occupancy—a declarator occupancy by the applicant spouse and a right of occupation at the same time by the non-applicant spouse—is to fly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0974">JPEG</span><!-- image -->

	<i>Amendment made:</i> No. 42, in page 5, line 2, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>" but, subject to section 2 of this Act, an order under this subsection shall not prejudice the rights of any third party in relation to the non-performance of any obligation under such hire-purchase or conditional sale agreement".—

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 43, in page 5, line 2, at end add—
	<br><blockquote><p>" or the personal effects of either spouse or of any child of the family".</p></blockquote>
This refers to a situation
	<br><blockquote><p>"Where one spouse owns or hires, or is acquiring under a hire-purchase or conditional sale agreement, furniture and plenishings … if he or she has occupancy rights in that home, may apply to the court for an order granting to the applicant the possession or use in the matrimonial home of any such furniture and plenishings ".</p></blockquote>
The reason why I put this down is that, although it may be of no great importance, it is an analogous point to the one made by the hon. Member for South Angus (Mr. Peter Fraser). If we look at clause 3(4), which is for interim arrangements, we shall see that the one thing which can be covered by an interim order, apart from the furniture and plenishings, with which we are dealing in subsection (2), is
	<br><blockquote><p>" the personal effects of either spouse or of any child of the family".</p></blockquote>
It is not very clear why, if one can make an order about personal possessions, and so on, on an interim basis, there is no provision in subsection 3(2) for including them when the final declarator and the final arrangements are being promulgated by the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that it may be that the personal effects and so on are more important at the interim stage, but it may well be that no interim order is sought. There may be just a declarator sought ultimately, when a final solution is sought in the courts. I know, and I am sure that the Minister knows from his previous incarnation in the law, that often there can be very bitter and unfortunate disputes about personal effects and personal possessions. I should have thought there was a case, though not a major one. If we are allowing the courts to pass judgment on occupancy, and on possession of furniture and plenishings, it may be that that term is not broad enough to encompass certain categories of personal effects. I am supported in that by the fact that there is specific reference to personal effects in subsection (4). That is an omission which is on the margin but which it would be wise to put right, and the amendment is an attempt to do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am advised that the amendment is otiose because the existing law confers upon the owner of personal effects the right of use and possession of them. Where the owner needs to recover such personal effects from the matrimonial home or from the possession of the other spouse, he or she may apply to the court under clause 3(4),
	<span class='label label-info column'>78</span>
which, as the hon. Member will see, refers specifically to the personal effects of either spouse or of any child of the family. The order can be enforced by delivery order under subsection (5). Therefore, on that basis I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that the amendment is in fact unnecessary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am totally unconvinced by that extraordinary reply. It presupposes that if I want to raise an action for occupancy of the matrimonial home, and I raise it under clause 3(1), if there is also a dispute, not about furniture and plenishings but about personal effects, I must make an interim application, which may then presumably be enforced under subsection (5). I can see that that possibility is open to me. It seems a clumsy, backhanded way of doing it. I am only suggesting that there may be cases where there is no need for an interim order or application at all. If it is proper that personal effects be dealt with ad interim, there seems to me an irrefutable case for saying that it ought to be possible to deal with them ad ultimum, when the final order is made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendment, if it were implemented in its present form, would enable one spouse to seek from the court an order enabling her to continue possession of the other spouse's personal effects. That would be highly undesirable. When we are dealing with personal effects, for the reason that the hon. Gentleman himself argued, it is often a matter of considerable personal feeling, and it is not desirable in policy that the personal effects of one spouse should be able to be ordered by the court to remain in possession of the other spouse. If it is simply a dispute about whose personal effects they are, that is a separate issue, but not one that would be covered by the hon. Gentleman's amendment. His amendment would have the effect of enabling the court to allow one applicant spouse to continue with possession of

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am noted for the grace of my concessions, Mr. Gourlay, and would be the first to say that the wording may be defective. But the intention is clear. I must confess that the wording is defective, because I merely lifted it from subsection (4) and perhaps did not think long enough whether the straight lift was entirely appropriate. My point is clear to anyone who has thought about it, and the Minister should be a little more forthcoming. There is a clear case for saying that in the making of the final order personal effects as well as furniture and plenishings should be included. Two categories are obviously drawn and I should have thought there was virtue in that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree on the principle involved here, but the hon.

The purpose of the subsection is to allow the other spouse to get possession of those plenishings or furniture in order to enjoy the occupancy rights. If we are dealing with that particular problem, this is not the place in

	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, because subsection (4) is clearly on an interim basis and I should have thought that there was a case for looking at it under clause 3(1). I am not convinced of the moral absolute of saying that where one spouse owns something there should be no possibility of possession being given to the other spouse. Clearly it happens in any event just in the occupation and furnishings of the matrimonial home. That is the whole point of clause 2. On the personal effects point, there might be circumstances in which a personal effect was of particular importance, although it had been bought by and was personal to the husband, it might be something that might be much more useful to the family as a whole, and if the children were staying with the spouse I am sure that there would not be a case for that apportionment of personal effects to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In any event, I should like to scuttle from this by saying to the Minister that I think there is a case for making sure that the consideration of personal effects should not just be an interim order but should be looked at under some other heading, under clause 3(1) or (2). I should be happy to leave it with him.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be happy to consider that. It may be that the existing common law is sufficient to deal with problems of this kind.

There is a big difference between these two words " possession " and " use ", and I am not clear about circumstances which would make such a difference between the two. How would one say that the " possession" should be granted and in another case only the " use of "? Is the hon.

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not a question of the court deciding whether it is possession or use. With certain kinds of property " possession " might be a more appropriate way of describing the enjoyment of that property, and with other types of property the word " use " might be more appropriate. Certain things are easier to possess than others. I think it
	<span class='label label-info column'>80</span>
is a more gramatical alternative rather than suggesting any level of rights which would be enjoyed by the spouse concerned.

	<div class='membercontribution'>: The amendments refer to the criteria under clause 3(3). These criteria are applied by the courts when considering whether they should grant an occupancy right to a non-entitled spouse. The Committee will remember that they are of particular importance, because they crop up again as part of the criteria which have to be applied under clause 4.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first amendment seeks to leave out paragraph 
	<i>(a),</i> which specifically allows the courts to consider
	<br><blockquote><p>" the conduct of the spouses in relation to each other and otherwise".</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0976">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>81</span>
I am not quite sure what "and otherwise" means in this case. Presumably, it might refer to conduct in relation to other members of the family apart from the spouse. This is a small point, but it is a general philosophical approach. I think that the needs of the respective spouses are important, whether they have alternative accommodation, whether they are cohabiting with someone else in the case of the non-applicant spouse, and so on. Certainly the needs of the children are of enormous importance in making a judgment as to whether an occupancy right should be declared against the non-applicant spouse, who is likely to be the tenant or the owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure about the relevance of
	<br><blockquote><p>"the conduct of the spouses in relation to each other".</p></blockquote>
I suppose there is some virtue in saying that if one is beating the other that might colour the court's views whether he or she should be given occupancy. But I do not really see the declarator of occupancy rights as a punitive measure. In the same way, I do not think that one should give a great deal of weight to the fact that a wife had committed adultery and that the marriage had broken up because of her flagrant adultery. I do not think that should be a major factor in deciding whether social justice, the needs of the children and the social realities dictate that she should be given an occupancy right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to exclude entirely the conduct of the spouses—I accept that that is particularly important in terms of clause 4 where unreasonable conduct has to be alleged—but I am a little worried about the prominence that it gets in paragraph 
	<i>(a).</i> The point of tabling the amendment was to invite the Under-Secretary to say a few words about that matter. It is open to argument whether we can exclude it altogether, but I think it is rather against the approach of the courts to these problems in recent years. I think that needs and financial resources are more important than the moral judgment which the court may or may not wish to apply to given facts and circumstances which may or may not have been properly argued in front of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 45 seeks to add a new ground for consideration. The Minister may say that it is not necessary because the needs and financial resources of the spouses could encompass the point I am making. But let us take the case of a wealthy family. We have to make arrangements for the wealthy as for everybody else. Let us assume that a family own two houses—not owned by the National Trust, but available for occupation. The second may even be a small country cottage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is quite clear in the definition of " matrimonial home " that, in deciding to go for an occupancy right, a spouse can nominate the house. In other words, the spouse does not need to go for the matrimonial home in which he or she has been living regularly. The country cottage can be nominated. Indeed, there might be legitimate reasons for so doing in terms of personal preference, schooling, nearness to relatives and so on. One might construct a model where that would be a not unreasonable thing to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>82</span>
On the other hand, the non-applicant spouse might prefer to offer accommodation which was perfectly adequate in his mind—and that would be a matter for the court's opinion—and have uninterrupted occupancy rights of the particular house which was the subject of the application.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
his matter can be argued backwards and forwards. It is a barren argument, because only the court can decide at the time. But if a non-applicant spouse makes an alternative offer of accommodation to the entitled spouse—the phraseology must be wrong, because it should be " applicant" rather than " non-entitled " spouse—in other words, if the applicant has an option open to him or her, the court should at least be able to take that into account in exactly the same way as, for example, when someone has been made redundant, an offer of alternative employment is a relevant consideration. I do not see anything prejudicial to the applicant spouse in putting that in. It may not, strictly speaking, be relevant, but it does not fall happily into any of the categories in paragraphs 
	<i>(a), (b),</i> (c), and 
	<i>(d).</i> Therefore, I invite the Under-Secretary to consider whether it should be added.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 46 is to leave out paragraph 
	<i>(d).</i> That is arguing the other way. That is where we have put in and given undue prominence to something which would be better covered in general terms by the respective needs and financial resources of the spouses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I suppose that this is an attempt to cover the dentist's surgery argument: that the husband, who will be the non-applicant spouse, is practising from the premises. Therefore, special consideration should be given to the fairness of making an occupancy order, given the fact that it is his livelihood as well as his home. I should have thought that that clearly, fairly and squarely could be argued in terms of paragraph 
	<i>(b).</i> I fear that, by putting in 
	<i>(d)</i> specifically, the fact that a man is practising some sort of trade is erected as an impediment to an occupancy right. That is not the intention, but I fear that psychologically the onus may shift. Of course, it is a very proper factor for the court to consider. But dentists' surgeries can be rented. Other accommodation can be found. I am not sure that it is important enough to justify inclusion as a separate sub-heading or on its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All these points are uncomplicated and comparatively simple in themselves. Whether they have any validity in the mind of the Minister we shall discover shortly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is correct to link the amendments together, because they cover the same points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As far as the first amendment is concerned, which proposes to leave out paragraph (a) the considerations that the court has to take into account are not considerations which are relevant to the actual declaration of an occupancy right. The terms of subsection (3) make it clear that these are considerations which are to be taken into account in respect of any use of subsection 3(l)(b), (c), 
	<i>(d)</i> and (e). The actual declaration of an occupancy right is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0977">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>83</span>
dependent either on the conduct of the parties or on any other matter of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having said that, which is relevant to the basic point I am making, it is unrealistic to believe that the courts could do other than take into account the conduct of the parties to one another when determining whether it was appropriate to enforce, restrict, regulate or protect occupancy rights. The very conduct of the parties led to the problem in the first place. I do not think that in practice we should achieve much by withdrawing those words from the clause. It is the conduct of the parties to one another which is the base from which everything else has proceeded. Therefore, it would be appropriate to leave these words in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Amendment No. 45 suggests that there should be a specific request to take into account any alternative accommodation available to the non-entitled spouse. There is some substance in the hon. Gentleman's point that there may be circumstances in which the entitled spouse is prepared to make other accommodation available. That is a relevant consideration, but it may not, strictly speaking, come under the needs and financial resources of the non-entitled spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
12.45 pm
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am advised that the wording of the hon. Gentleman's amendment is not appropriate, but I should certainly be prepared to consider introducing an amendment with a similar effect at a later stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his comments on amendment No. 46, the hon. Gentleman has recognised that it would be relevant to take into account these circumstances. He has simply questioned whether it is necessary to say so in so many words.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think it is appropriate to draw to the attention of the court that it would be a relevant consideration if the entitled spouse used the property not only as a matrimonial home but as an important part of his livelihood. The wording has been carefully chosen so that all that the court takes into account is the extent to which the matrimonial home is used in connection with a trade, business or profession. That choice of wording indicates that it is not, by any means, expected to be conclusive on the issue. However, it is clearly a relevant consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact that it may involve only a marginal use of the matrimonial home for a business or profession might lead the court not to ignore it, but to consider that it might not be sufficient to justify not acting in a way in which it would otherwise have wished to act. If, however, it was largely a business use—a small hotel would be a case in point, where the husband's occupation might be the running of the hotel in which the parties themselves lived—clearly it would be a major consideration if occupancy rights were being seriously considered. Therefore, the extent to which it is used for a business, trade or profession is clearly a relevant consideration and it is right to draw it to the court's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>84</span>
I should certainly be willing to introduce an amendment on the lines of amendment No. 45. Therefore, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not feel it necessary to press amendments Nos. 44 and 4G.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am content to drop amendment No. 44 without a backward glance. I accept that the courts must take some account of the conduct of the spouses. I just feel that there is a danger that it could be given undue prominence. But that is a matter for the courts and for those representing the parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased that the Minister sees virtue in amendment No. 45. A score of one out of three is better than I usually achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for amendment No. 46, I shall not push the matter. I do think that the inclusion of this matter under paragraph 
	<i>(d)</i> is unnecessary. We could no doubt think of very many things that could be argued under 
	<i>(b)</i> or (c) which have not been dignified with a separate entry, if I may so put it. But if the Minister is thirled to its inclusion, I do not feel strongly about it and would not wish to press the point. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<i>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</i></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move amendment No. 47, in page 5, line 33, at end insert—
	<br><blockquote><p>'(4A) Any order made under subsection (3) or (4) may regulate any financial payments which the court may direct either spouse to make to the other or to a third party in connection with the payment of rent rates, secured loan instalments interest or other out-goings and the necessary repairs, improvements or other payments which have arisen or will arise from the exercise of any occupancy right which is the subject of such an order.".</p></blockquote>
This is a probing amendment. I may have overlooked some obvious provision of the Bill, but, as I understand it, under clause (3), which is an important clause, an occupancy right can be declared, enforced, restricted, regulated and protected. But there is no particular provision for making financial arrangements at that point. Of course, there is under clause 2, once an occupancy right is being enjoyed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are consequentials flowing from that which would allow one to go to the court, as the Minister well knows, to ask for apportionment and so on. But it is making heavy weather of it to say that I go under clause 3 and get a declarator and I perhaps get some arrangements made about the use of the physical facilities of the house. However, I am not clear that under clause 3(1) I can also say at that stage " As I am going to have an occupancy right, could the courts not make an arrangement about the payment of rates, and how that should be apportioned, and so on? " I should have thought that there was some virtue in doing it at that stage, rather than making an application, perhaps under clause 2 and under another clause retrospectively.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have got hold of the wrong end of the stick here, and there may be some arrangement which would allow this to be done, but it is not clear—I put it no higher. I put down this amendment because I thought it was a power which might
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0978">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>85</span>
be useful to the courts, and the Minister should consider whether it should be made more specific.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point raised by the hon. Gentleman is almost entirely covered by clause 2(3), which provides specific rights for the courts to make an order apportioning expenditure between the parties, and that may clearly involve indicating that one particular spouse should be entirley responsible for the payment of rates or rent, or other provisions of that kind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only other area which might be considered relevant is in regard to mortgage payments, and the hon. Gentleman may be aware that the Government have now on the Amendment Paper new clause 3, which specifically protects the position of those involved in obligations to a building society, in order to be able to deal with the point which was brought to our attention by the building societies themselves. I should have thought that these provisions combined would meet the circumstance, and it would be an unnecessary complexity to introduce a further provision which is already met under clause 2(3) of the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member. That probably takes care of the matter. I have not considered new clause 3, which went down after my amendment and was not available at the time, but I will look at the position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I take it, from what the Minister says, that an application under clause 2(3), to which he has referred, could be made at the time when a declarator under clause 3 was being asked for from the courts? I am anxious to ensure that we are not in a situation where we must have unnecessary applications to the courts to arrange matters retrospectively once a declarator of occupancy is in force. I want to make sure that it can all be combined in one order at the same time. If that is so, I shall be happy to leave it there, and I see that the Minister is assenting to it. On that basis I shall be prepared to leave this subject, having a look at the impact of new clause 3 on this area. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>86</span>
This is a probing amendment. Someone came to me in my constituency consulting period a couple of weeks ago and raised the problem of a rent-paying cottar tenancy in South Uist. Since then I have been deeply suspicious whenever I see the word " cottar " or " Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act", or anything of that kind. A feeling almost of panic overwhelms me. We have not solved the problem of the cottar tenancy in South Uist as yet, but I live in hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In subsection 4(3)(6), we are dealing with certain exclusions.
	<br><blockquote><p>"The court shall not make an exclusion order if it appears to the court that the making of the order would be unjustified or unreasonable …</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>" where the matrimonal home—

	<ol>

	<li>"is … part of an agricultural holding within the meaning of section 1 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1949; or</li>

	<li>"is let, or is a home in respect of which possession is given, to the non-applicant spouse or to both spouses by an employer as an incident of employment."</li></ol></p></blockquote>
In other words, as I understand it, this is either an agricultural holding, or a tied cottage or tied house, which is held as a result of the job. There is clearly an intention here that in those circumstances it will be much harder to get an exclusion order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that in a sense that is fair, but I am, rather anxious about the position of the spouse. I am rather anxious that just because it is a tied house there will not be automatic exclusion. I know that the Minister will say that tied houses are not automatically excluded by this form of words, but again it is a matter of the spirit of inclusion, and I think he owes us some comments, however brief, on the ramifications and consequences here.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I put down the amendment—and I make no apology for it—because of the last part of this paragraph:
	<br><blockquote><p>"subject to a requirement that the non-applicant spouse or, as the case may be, both spouses must reside in the matrimonial home, having regard to that requirement and the likely consequences of the exclusion of the non-applicant spouse from the matrimonial home.".</p></blockquote>
That is a very fine piece of gobbledegook, if I may say so, and it is extremely hard to make any sense of it. Each individual word is plain, uncomplicated, simple and will easily be found in any dictionary. When they are run together in the ingenious way which has been managed by the draftsman I at least —and it may be my own fault—find it very difficult to understand what they mean. I invite the Minister to expound, to parse, to elucidate, or anything else that he may wish to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to know what that phrase means. I presume that it qualifies sub-paragraph (i) and (ii) of 
	<i>(b),</i> but does it qualify 
	<i>(a)</i> as well? As it is set out it is not entirely clear to me. I see that knowledgeable heads are shaking, suggesting that it does not qualify paragraph 
	<i>(a),</i> but that it applies only to the two sub-paragraphs of paragraph 
	<i>(b).</i> Even with that information safely tucked under my belt I am struggling well down the field when it comes to comprehension, and I look forward to some instruction from the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1980-1981V006P0I0979">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>87</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can give the hon. Gentleman information. Whether I can also give him comprehension is not for me to speculate on. The basis of this part of the clause is quite straightforward. Where an entitled spouse occupies the house by nature of his employment, in this particular case an agricultural tenant, that clearly is a very special circumstance which the court would wish to take into account. For example, if there was no alternative accommodation available, the granting of an occupancy right to the non-entitled spouse might lead to the entitled spouse losing his employment, because if the purpose of granting him the accommodation in the first place had been to enable him to carry out certain work, then, particularly in an agricultural area where there might not be alternative suitable employment, the effect of that spouse not being able to occupy the property might not only mean that there were serious consequences for his employment but might also result in the termination of the tenancy itself, which would affect both spouses. If there was a situation where the spouse was required as a condition of his employment to occupy the tenancy, and vice versa, if he was no longer occupying the property that could bring the tenancy to an immediate end and that would be neither in his interest nor in the interests of the non-entitled spouse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are the circumstances which are covered by this part of the provision. The further point I would make is that it does not prohibit the enforcement of an occupancy right. It just draws the court's attention that there are very special circumstances here which would not apply elsewhere in the Bill. I think it is absolutely right and proper that if the tenancy could be brought to an end, or the employment of the spouse could be terminated, simply as a result of the enforcement of an occupancy right, it is absolutely essential that the court should be aware of that fact when it considers how it is to act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>88</span>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not know that this takes us very much further, and I do not know that it will take me very much further either if I pursue it. As far as I can see, the kernel of the argument is in clause 4(3):
	<br><blockquote><p>" The court shall not make an exclusion order if it appears that the making of the order would be unjustified or unreasonable;—</p></blockquote>
where the matrimonial home is a tied cottage—
	<br><blockquote><p>" subject to a requirement that the non-applicant spouse or, as the case may be, both spouses must reside in the matrimonial home ".</p></blockquote>
In other words, the non-applicant spouse must actually be living there if this weighting is to apply. The paragraph continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>" having regard to that requirement and the likely consequences of the exclusion of the non-applicant spouse from the matrimonial home."</p></blockquote>
I think I understand that, but it is extremely difficult in terms of its drafting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>
	<div class='member'>Mr. Rifkind</div> <!-- member -->
	<div class='membercontribution'>: In a sense that provision was to deal with the very point that the hon.

	<div class='member'>Mr. Dewar</div> <!-- member -->
