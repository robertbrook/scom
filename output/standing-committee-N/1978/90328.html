<section>
<div class='page-header'><h1>RATES AND RATING IN NORTHERN IRELAND</h1></div>
<p>10.30 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tom Pendry)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee have considered the matter of rates and rating in Northern Ireland.</p></blockquote>
I welcome the opportunity for this debate, because it has become clear to me that the question of the regional rate in Northern Ireland, and particularly how it is arrived at, is one which is a cause of concern both to ratepayers and to those who represent them. It is for this reason indeed, that I issued the report of the working party setting out the problems of assessing the regional rate and asking for h. Ms.' comments, for those of other elected representatives and indeed of anyone interested. This meeting of the Committee gives me the valuable opportunity of hearing h. Ms.' responses.<br><br>
H. Ms. will know that the rating system currently applying in Northern Ireland, and, so far as the regional rate is concerned peculiar to Northern Ireland, arose from the decision in 1972 by the Government of Northern Ireland to reorganise local government along the lines recommended by the Review Body on Local Government, generally known as the Macrory Report. This reorganisation was endorsed by the Stormont Parliament when it passed the Local Government Act in 1972 transferring many major services from the former local authorities to central Government Departments and setting up 26 district councils to carry out the remaining functions. The district councils, as h. Ms. will be aware, strike their own rates to finance their own services, and the Department of Finance makes the regional rate for all Northern Ireland to raise part of the cost of services now carried out by the central Government Departments.<br><br>
It is, of course, this latter regional rate with which I think the Committee is most concerned. It is, however, not like a normal local authority rate, which is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
struck when, in broad terms, a local authority has decided on its policies, seen what grants it will receive, what money it will have in hand and therefore what it needs to raise by way of rates and what poundage needs to be struck. With such a normal local authority rate, therefore, a ratepayer can know what services his local authority is providing for the money he pays in rates, since these services are quite clearly defined and separate from any others provided by other bodies or central government. But the regional rate is not like that. It is related not to services which can be clearly isolated but to those which are part and parcel of wider government services.<br><br>
It seems rather a pity that the regional rate ever became known as a rate, when it is much more nearly a tax. Indeed the Minister who introduced the Rates (Northern Ireland) Order in the House of Commons in October 1972 stated that the Northern Ireland ratepayer would pay his regional rate into the Northern Ireland Exchequer like any other tax, and would thereby have a burden of rates equitable by comparison with his counterpart in the rest of the United Kingdom. He went on to say that it would become impossible beyond 1973–74 to calculate the regional rate by reference to what services had been transferred to central government from the former local authorities.<br><br>
Furthermore, on 4 April 1974 in the Northern Ireland Assembly the Head of the Department of Finance spelled out in great detail why the regional rate could not be related to specific services and stressed that it was a contribution towards the cost of regional services. I am sure that it is clear to hon. Members, therefore, that the current system of rating in Northern Ireland, and in particular the concept of the regional rate, is not a burden imposed by direct rule but was devised and endorsed by both the Stormont Parliament and the Assembly.<br><br>
Of course, many find it difficult to accept that the regional rate cannot be assessed on the basis of precise expenditure in the way of the normal local authority rate. They ask why we could not have continued to cost the services as they were originally carried out by the former local authorities. We could not have carried on like this since it would have been unrealistic to assume that those services, as they were in 1973, would remain the same either in content

or expenditure or in the degree of central government grant support obtaining.<br><br>
10.35 a.m.<br><br>
Any rate based on such an idea of freezing the situation as in 1973 would be purely speculative. I feel that we would not have been any better able to show the Northern Ireland ratepayer that he was getting a fair deal nor the United Kingdom taxpayer that the Northern Ireland citizen was bearing a fair share of rates and taxes.<br><br>
Another idea put forward by some is to select services similar to those taken over from local authorities into central Government Departments and to fix a rate based on the expenditure on these. The problem here is not just one of isolating or costing services but of deciding what portion of the cost of such services should fall on the ratepayer and what on the taxpayer who would meet the balance of the cost.<br><br>
This leads me to an important point which I feel I must stress. The Macrory report recommended that in financing the reorganisation of local government in 1973 there should be no net transfer from the ratepayer to the taxpayer, and the Government have firmly taken this stand since. In addition, this means that the Northern Ireland ratepayer should not pay less than his counterpart in the rest of the United Kingdom. I think that we all accept that this is a fair and reasonable approach.<br><br>
One has, of course, to acknowledge that if the Northern Ireland ratepayer and taxpayer is paying the same as his Great Britain counterpart he should receive the same services. Whilst there can be no absolute comparison of services—they vary, indeed, from area to area within the United Kingdom—it is Government policy to see that the Northern Ireland services are comparable with the rest of the United Kingdom.<br><br>
I think everyone realises the desirability of showing the ratepayer that he is getting a fair deal. Indeed, the Government have clearly shown their awareness of this problem by setting up the working party to look into the fairest way of assessing the regional rate. In the report of the working party, various methods are examined. The Government are ready to examine others which seem to have merit, and I should like to have such comments from interested parties by the end of May this year. As the report was published on 5 February this
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
year, that gives a rather longer period of consultation than normal.<br><br>
I wish to make it abundantly clear that the Government have not made up their mind on these issues, and I shall take on board, and give proper consideration to, all the points put to me. I look forward in particular to hearing today the considered views of members of this Committee on this complicated and admittedly controversial topic, for I regard today's debate as an essential part of the consultation following on the publication of the report of the working party.</span></p>
<p>10.38 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Airey Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary is right to say that this is a very important debate for Northern Ireland. We welcome the opportunity for consultation which he is offering us. I hope that he will listen carefully to what we have to say about the future rating system of the Province.<br><br>
In the debate on the rating order on 21 February, I pressed for this debate, as did other h. Ms. on behalf of Northern Ireland. In that debate I congratulated Professor Lawrence on the working party report. Having studied the report more carefully, I think I was a little premature in my congratulations, because the working party has produced a not very long report. There are but 36 paragraphs, which took three and a half years to produce. I think that that is rather an excessive period. Can the Under-Secretary tell us why it took so long a time to produce the report? It is a short and rather bland document.<br><br>
Whether the report accurately reflects the scope of the work done over such an extensive period, I do not know. We are entitled to much more detailed consideration after the expenditure of so much time and effort. Perhaps in answering the debate the Under-Secretary will comment on that.<br><br>
There are only two paragraphs of conclusions in the report, and they do not take us very far.<br><br>
10.40 a.m.<br><br>
We read:
<br><blockquote><p>"In the opinion of the working party, the 'average change in England and Wales' approach monitored by the RSG calculations, has most to offer."</p></blockquote>
That is all that is said by way of recommendation of the method to be applied to
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0680">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
the regional rate. It is in paragraph 37, as the Under-Secretary of State will know, because he introduced the working party report with a preface that we have all read.<br><br>
I should like also to refer to another observation which I made on 21 February, when I said that—as the Under-Secretary explained to us—Northern Ireland did not have its own rating authorities. I regretted that having the duty of collecting the rates resting with the Government Department was not wholly satisfactory. I feel that that makes stronger the case made by some of us for elected regional authorities in the Province. The element of flexibility that local authorities have in Great Britain is lacking, as was underlined by the r. h. M. for Down, South (Mr. Powell) during the same debate. Those points are important for the future of the Province, and show the need for more democratic control of regional administration.<br><br>
We should remember that the key services, which the r. h. G. described in some detail, and which were transferred to Stormont, were regional services. In that connection he mentioned the Macrory report, and he will know that I strongly advised the Secretary of State to call back Sir Patrick Macrory to advise him on what the structure and powers of an elected body should be.<br><br>
We have made clear our aim to set up one or more regional councils in Northern Ireland. We think that a brief independent examination of these matters, particularly rating, and all the powers which could be restored to Northern Ireland should be made.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Kilfedder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The h. G. said that he favoured the establishment of one or two regional councils in Northern Ireland. I hope that if there is a Conservative Administration after the election he will not condemn the people of Northern Ireland to that, because Ulster needs the Stormont Parliament. That is what Macrory had in mind, and we should have a fair rating system centred on that. I hope that the h. G. will assure the people of Northern Ireland that that is what the Conservative Party has in mind.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the Committee will not stray too widely into local government reform.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee has heard what the h. G. had to say. I have said that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
in our view there should be an independent examination of those matters. I think, Mr. Wells, that it would be right to leave the matter there. I note what you said about straying any further into local government reform. But the point was important, because there are no rating authorities in Northern Ireland and there is no local government at present between district councils and direct rule.<br><br>
I should like to ask two questions about the composition of the working party. What happened there seems mysterious to me, in view of the nature of the recommendations. That body, when first established in 1975, began life purely as an interdepartmental committee, composed of members of the Civil Service, as I understand it. In November 1976 representatives of the Association of Local Authorities, in which all 26 district councils in Northern Ireland participate, were invited to join. How many representatives did the association provide? Were the civil servants still in the majority after the reshaping had taken place? That has some bearing on the type of conclusions and recommendations reached by the working party as a whole. We should like to know the answer in regard to future consideration of how rating should be handled in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
10.45 a.m.<br><br>
Now I come to the regional rate and paragraph 4 of this report, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"The services transferred from local to central government, where they have been distributed among the central departments, have been merged with the administration of other departmental functions. In consequence, the services taken over have lost their separate identities, and as normal Parliamentary financial control did not require it, no separate accounts of their costs have been kept by the administering departments."</p></blockquote>
This calls for further examination. There is no longer any direct relation—the Under-Secretary has said this today—between the regional rate and those local government services which the rates in Northern Ireland were originally designed to finance. As a result of the transfer of so many local government responsibilities to the Government of Northern Ireland in 1973 these services are entirely merged, as paragraph 4 makes clear.<br><br>
The finance raised through the regional rate apparently is included along with all other items in the overall accounts of the various Government Departments. We
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0681">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
do not feel that that is a satisfactory system or aspect of democracy, and we should like to see rating powers restored eventually to elected local authorities. That is our position whether the authorities are described as regional or local.<br><br>
As paragraph 10 points out, the regional rate—again, the Under-Secretary quoted this, and I hesitate to repeat what he said— could be
<br><blockquote><p>"more accurately defined as a regional tax in lieu of contribution towards central Government services,"</p></blockquote>
including those which prior to their transfer were in the hands of local authorities. Will the Under-Secretary tell us the Government's opinion on the need for more democratic control here and the restoration of those powers to local authorities? He said that Northern Ireland should have services comparable with those in the rest of the United Kingdom, and I agree. There ought to be more discretion and flexibility in the hands of those elected by the people of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Paragraph 9 of the report shows that members of the working party advocated that revenue raised by the regional rate should be spent specifically on those services transferred in 1973 and accounted for separately instead of being merged into the general departmental accounts. That was the recommendation of the working party, but was that view pressed largely or wholly by representatives of the Association of Local Authorities on the working party? Was it their recommendation? It is the point of view that we on the Conservative Benches hold. Was this view of the elected representatives drawn from the district councils overruled by those from the official side? It seems unfortunate that their recommendation should not have been met. We were not able to understand exactly what happened.<br><br>
In the same connection I wish to refer to paragraph 38. In its final conclusions the working party suggests that
<br><blockquote><p>"some attempt should be made to give ratepayers an indication of the services to which they are contributing by way of the regional rate."</p></blockquote>
We do not see how that can be done if the collection of rates is to be done entirely by Government Departments and if the accounting is as the working party report states, and the Government do not intend to reform the position. How is this recommendation to be met? How is it to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
be done with any accuracy or conviction without some form of separate accounting which links regional services directly with the finance raised by the regional rate? I hope that the Under-Secretary has taken the point. That is the recommendation of the working party, and I think that the Government must meet that point. It is important in regard to future democratic administration in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
10.50 a.m.<br><br>
The Under-Secretary touched on the question of comparison with the rest of the United Kingdom. Paragraph 5 of the report says that the regional rate
<br><blockquote><p>"has been .struck on the basis of establishing a Northern Ireland rate burden comparable to that imposed on ratepayers in the rest of the UK."</p></blockquote>
It suggests that as a basis. In paragraphs 10, 17 and 18 it goes further, to show that for the purposes of the report comparisons have been confined to England and Wales and have not touched on Scotland.<br><br>
We have done some research into this matter. In 1975 the Northern Ireland Office explained that comparisons were being made with nine county and metropolitan areas in the North of England in order to establish general parity of rating with the rest of the United Kingdom. A fact sheet was issued by the Northern Ireland Office Information Service in 1975.<br><br>
What was the reason for limiting the comparisons in this way? The terms of reference of this brief report would have permitted the working party to go wider. Surely a comparison could have been made with a Scottish region, such as Strathclyde. That could have been instructive, especially as in Scotland there are no separate water authorities. I hope that the question of water authorities will be mentioned again in the debate. Paragraph 15 acknowledges that the existence of separate water authorities in England and Wales complicates comparisons between Britain and Northern Ireland. Anyone who knows anything about the subject would agree. It would have been useful if the comparison could have been widened to include a discussion of the situation in Scotland.<br><br>
Inclusion of these points would have made the review more comprehensive than the 38 paragraphs, which took three and a half years to produce. I do not think that that is entirely satisfactory.<br><br>
The h. G. helped the Committee with his concise and informative introduction, but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0682">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
he will be aware that in March 1978 the Association of Local Authorities called on the Government to establish a full-scale committee of inquiry to investigate the entire system of rates in Northern Ireland. In the debate in the House on the order on 21 February I mentioned that the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Alderman Cook, had made the same point. The association's action indicates a widespread sense of dissatisfaction with the existing system. This is felt by district councils, whose views must be given considerable weight by the h. G. when he considers all these matters before the end of May.<br><br>
Councillors are undoubtedly unhappy about the various anomalies which have appeared in the present system and the way in which it is working. The <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> of 11 March reported that the Lord Mayor had said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Many things are wrong with the present system and there are serious anomalies connected with the regional rate. I believe inequalities between ratepayers should be ironed out."</p></blockquote>
A much deeper investigation than the Lawrence report is necessary, as well as the application of the principle of democratic control of rating and more flexibility and discretion to elected regional authorities, such as we have suggested.<br><br>
In May 1978 the association decided to hold its hand until the working party's report had appeared, but the call has been renewed, and we should like the Government to tell us what reply they intend to give to the Lord Mayor of Belfast and the association. I think that eventually the association will make a more formal request for the establishment of a committee of inquiry, if it has not done so already.<br><br>
10.55 a.m.<br><br>
Perhaps r. h. and h. Ms. from Northern Ireland can tell us a bit more about the position.<br><br>
In the last analysis, the introduction of fresh methods of rate assessment, as proposed by this rather limited report, is of less importance to the people of Northern Ireland than the institutions by which the rate is struck. I do not wish to be unfair, but I think that the people would have more confidence in their elected representatives than in the wisdom of unknown officials working at a distance from them. That would not be so in regard to the district rate. That is different. But for the regional rate we should like to see elected representatives dealing with these matters in the future.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
<p>10.57 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. J. Enoch Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that this is the first appearance of the Under-Secretary of State in the Northern Ireland Committee, and it would therefore, I hope, be thought appropriate to welcome him on his debut. He is already well known in the Province, and short or long as his future tenure of office may prove to be in that office, all members of the Committee will wish him success.<br><br>
We are engaged this morning on an activity which, at first sight surprising, in reality forms the greater part of the business of politics, namely, that we set ourselves a problem which is inherently insoluble and then debate at length upon various non-solutions to it, and from time to time quarrel over them. The whole business has a Gulliverian flavour which, perhaps, is not inappropriate to a Committee whose business is tinctured with the affairs of the island for ever associated with Jonathan Swift.<br><br>
It all starts very easily with a rate. A rate, in its primordial simplicity, can be easily defined. It has three characteristics which it is useful to bear in mind as we enter the labyrinth from which, even with the assistance of the working party, we have not succeeded in finding the Ariadne's thread by which to emerge.<br><br>
These three characteristics are as follows. First, the levying of a rate is a sign of a responsibility taken by the body which levies it for the expenditure which it is to meet. It is an expression of the coherence of democratic representation and the power of taxation which lies at the root of our constitution. Secondly, it is a local tax, those who pay it and the scale upon which they pay it being locally anchored, so that the income tapped by this tax is unambiguously related to the area in which the relevant services are administered and applied. Thirdly, unlike taxation, which is not necessarily precisely related to particular expenditure, a rate, by its nature, starts from the fixing of the total sum to be raised for the meeting of specific expenditure and then is a way of allocating it over all the ratepayers.<br><br>
These are the three characteristics: democratic responsibility, local anchorage in the relevant area and relation to a specific outlay which is distributed fairly or unfairly over a known group of people— namely, the ratepayers of that district. That is how it all started. That classic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0683">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
picture is not seriously altered by the existence and the growth of Exchequer subventions.<br><br>
11.00 a.m.<br><br>
For there still remains, unless those subventions become quite exorbitant, a sufficient degree of local responsibility and initiative in deciding upon the items of expenditure, and, one may add—an important point to be borne in mind— policing the efficiency and probity with which money is locally spent upon those services.<br><br>
When we get into trouble, and when we get into the trouble which is engaging the Committee this morning, is when we transfer services from local democratic control to the arms of central government, whether central government nationally or central government provincially. That is how we entered the labyrinth. We did not, as the Under-Secretary correctly reminded the Committee, get into this as a spin-off from direct rule. We were already deep in it over the knees when it was decided at the beginning of this decade to dissolve the upper tier of local government in Northern Ireland and merge its functions in those of the provincial Government and Parliament.<br><br>
As soon as this happens an insoluble conundrum is created. The expenditure is decided upon not by the representatives of the ratepayers but by the representatives of the taxpayers and since 1973, with a brief intermission, by the representatives of the taxpayers of the United Kingdom here and elsewhere in this building assembled. In that sense, the Under-Secretary was quite right in saying that a rate is by that transfer transmuted into a tax.<br><br>
But this unfortunately does not go all the way, for the decision taken was not that these services in future should be borne by general taxation. It was not a transfer of a subject from local government to central government; it was a removal from one set of democratic representatives to the control of another set of elected representatives. Consequently, since local government continued in the rest of the United Kingdom, there was the contradiction whereby in the rest of the Kingdom ratepayers, as ratepayers and through a rate, would continue to bear their share of the cost of the corresponding services.<br><br>
It would be absurd and indefensible if the pattern of taxation in Northern Ireland
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
became different from that in the rest of the Kingdom. It was in an endeavour to maintain the pattern of taxation and the place of this tax called a rate in that total pattern that the notional regional rate was invented at the beginning of the 1970s and has existed ever since.<br><br>
Perhaps I should have said earlier that a rate levied upon the value—annual, current or capital—of property in a given area is and has been almost from the start under continual attack. No sign of the novice in this field is more eminent than the delight and self-confidence with which he applies himself to discovering an alternative to rates. But over the decades these attempts, joyfully entered into, have invariably ended with the sorrowful conclusion that no alternative could be found.<br><br>
I believe—this is germane to the point— after some third of a century devoted to, amongst other things, the contemplation of this question, that if we are to have local government at all, and therefore if we are to have locally identified taxation, there is no substitute for rating of property values as we know it, or almost as we know it.<br><br>
11.05 a.m.<br><br>
This is fair enough provided that not too large a proportion of the total tax burden is borne in this particular, rather regressive, form. It is something that we have to live with—we are not living with it in Northern Ireland at the moment though we should like to be—as the price which most of us believe we ought to pay for having representative-elected local government.<br><br>
I return to the proposition that it would be intolerable and a breach of the principle of parity in taxation which the people of Northern Ireland insist upon within the United Kingdom, if this transfer had caused an alteration in the pattern of taxation in the Province, as compared with the pattern of the burden in the rest of the United Kingdom. There had to be the simulacrum of a rate in Northern Ireland. But how was it to be assessed? In the total expenditure, grant and what would otherwise be rate borne were inextricably combined. The decisions were to be taken by those who, although not conscious of having ratepayers breathing down their necks, were conscious of having the resources of the whole United Kingdom— as far as they could be extracted from the Treasury—behind them. There was no means of localising, which is the nature of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0684">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
a rate, the varying burden and the varying incidence of the services in the different parts of the Province.<br><br>
A compromise was hit upon, the compromise of comparability. Find what the people of Northern Ireland would be paying by way of rates if they were not the people of Northern Ireland but were the people of Humberside and other parts of Yorkshire and it is a rough measure of fairness to construct a system which levies from them, in lieu of rates, the sort of sum which they would be paying as rates in those hypothetical circumstances.<br><br>
I do not need to dilate upon the difficulties of any such comparison, such as the fact that the sources of decision which govern this expenditure, as well as the forms of administration which police it, are decidedly different in Humberside from Northern Ireland. But that is not the only example of many disparities which render the comparison inherently unsatisfactory.<br><br>
Nor, as a matter of fact—this is important to be understood—has this approach been carried through. Here I should like to thank the Minister for his courtesy in placing in the hands of the members of the Committee and of Northern Ireland Ms. in particular, this excellent collection of documents bearing upon the rates in Northern Ireland. My attention was arrested by annex A to paper No. 1, headed
<br><blockquote><p>"Striking of Rates since Reorgonisation of Local Govt".</p></blockquote>
An extraordinary story it is. In 1974–75 this new course was entered upon in the belief that the difference which had to be bridged between the comparable areas in England and the current rate in Northern Ireland was 10 per cent. That figure turned out afterwards to have been wildly wrong, wildly low, and the successive paragraphs of that annex record that never has Northern Ireland caught up with the estimate, always belated, of what rates would have been if Northern Ireland had been in Yorkshire.<br><br>
Instead of that the original figure, as adjusted in 1975–76, has been taken as an arbitrary base and the figure levied in lieu of rates in Northern Ireland has been scaled up year by year in the same percentage as the increase—<br><br>
11.10 a.m.<br><br>
—in rates payable in England and Wales. I hope that that is correct, but if there were
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
some marginal inaccuracy in the description it conveys, I am sure correctly, the fact that even if at the start there was some—I will not misuse the word "theological" but will say instead "hypothetical"—basis of comparability to provide the starting point, that ground was never stood upon and we have progressively departed from it as the years have gone by.<br><br>
What is happening now is that each year there is levied in Northern Ireland in lieu of rates and upon a rateable basis a sum which represents a percentage of X, a percentage annually adjusted in relation to a comparable upward movement in England and Wales.<br><br>
This is where we come to the report of the working party. It was generous of the h. M. for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) to pay tribute to Professor Lawrence for his work in this connection, but in fact Professor Lawrence was occupied on other things and the fruits of his labours were garnered in the order that we were debating when the h. M. made his earlier speech, of which he reminded us this morning. But this is where the working party was brought in, to survey the wreckage, so to speak. It did not come to a conclusion, but the chairman gained the general impression—I hope that I am not being too unfair in that description—at the end of it all that there was nothing better than the system on which we were working, of an annual adjustment of X in line with the rise of rates in England and Wales.<br><br>
I must say that I agree with the chairman, for it will be an arbitrary figure anyhow. At least there is a non-arbitrary element in the annual <i>pari passu</i> adjustment with the burdens on ratepayers in England and Wales and one cannot tinker with something which is inherently arbitrary to make it less arbitrary.<br><br>
Incidentally, perhaps our deliberations would have been more mature this morning had we been able to start upon them at an earlier date. I think that we should put on record a faint complaint that the report was signed on 18 August, so the Under-Secretary kindly informed me in a parliamentary answer, because a date does not appear in the printed document, and it was not available until February. One wonders what had been going on in the meantime. It seems a long period for proof correction of a document as brief as this.<br><br>
However, now that we have it and now that the conundrum is displayed once again by the working party report, it is incumbent upon us to express our judgment.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0685">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
Accordingly I say that, having got ourselves into this insoluble difficulty by the transfer of services from local government to nonlocal government, there is no advantage to be gained in trying to find some different but equally arbitrary basis for the levying of sums in lieu of rates.<br><br>
The people of Northern Ireland would be well advised to take a look at the percentage of the total rate-attributable expenditure, as shown in paper 4 in the dossier, which they are bearing by way of rates. For 1977–78 the rates yield was £93.3 million against a total relevant expenditure of approximately £420 million. In other words, well under 25 per cent ofthe relevant expenditure is, in Northern Ireland, being borne in the form of the rate equivalent.<br><br>
11.15 a.m.<br><br>
Before anyone rushes off and tells it in Gath that the people of Northern Ireland are getting away lightly because they are paying a lower proportion of the relevant expenditure by way of rates than in the rest of the Kingdom, we should remind ourselves straight away, not merely that the total of £420 million is precisely the total that the Under-Secretary explained could not be accurately ascertained, but, much more seriously, that it is a total of expenditure not decided upon in the same way as those expenditures are decided upon and controlled in England and Wales, and is, rather, the fruit of Government decision. Maybe we would support most of their decisions, but it would not be true to say that the ratepayer as a ratepayer in Northern Ireland is the gainer by a true disparity of the nature of that 25 per cent ratio that I have mentioned.<br><br>
So we have a conundrum, and like all conundrums it is insoluble and we are duty bound to explain to those whom we represent what is its nature, why it is insoluble and that, while we have to live with it, they are not by and large being unfairly dealt with. We have to live with it for as long as the services, which in the rest of the Kingdom are administered by local authorities, are not administered by local authorities in Northern Ireland. That is a precise and accurate statement. The restoration of a post-Macrory Stormont would leave us with almost exactly the same conundrum. It would still be impossible for the rate burden to be justified to the ratepayer as it has to be in the rest of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
the Kingdom and the figure assessed by way of rates would still be wholly arbitrary. Maybe it would be a political decision, but it would still be an arbitrary decision.<br><br>
It is only by the restoration to the people of Northern Ireland of the right which the people in the rest of the United Kingdom enjoy unconsciously, and take for granted, namely the services towards which they pay rates being administered by their democratically elected local bodies, that we shall solve the conundrum ofthe rating system of Northern Ireland. We would then solve a great deal more too, but we are talking, as you reminded us Mr. Wells, about the rates. One was gratified to observe that the h. M. for Abingdon both grasped and stated this principle so clearly and firmly.<br><br>
This is an unsatisfactory conclusion to arrive at in the short term, but in the long term the implications are unmistakable. Parity we claim. Parity, as the Minister has reminded us, we have in taxation and are intended to have in services. But there is another parity which cannot be omitted and that is parity in form of government. Until we have parity in form of government, which, assuredly, sooner or later, this House will see is a necessity for and the right of Northern Ireland, we shall continue to flounder into the morass from which there emerged the working party.</span></p>
<p>11.20 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall be relatively brief but I want to touch on the question of parity. I am extremely grateful that the r. h. M. for Down, South (Mr. Powell), in a most interesting speech on the question of responsibility, concluded his remarks by reference to parity.<br><br>
The h. M. for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) made a number of interesting comments, but he may well have gone further than his party would care. During the next few weeks, we shall hope to hear a clear statement of the h. G.'s view, not merely in regard to the political structures of Northern Ireland but on the whole question of public expenditure in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
It seems—this is the main purpose of my speech—that the Opposition are in danger of maintaining their support for sweeping and savage cuts in public expenditure which they may not have fully realised would be gravely disadvantageous to their own constituencies. Because I believe, as the r. h. G. has reminded us, that it is our duty to consider carefully the details of the moneys
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0686">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
which the House approves and which it has responsibility to supervise, I hope that my h. F. will this morning, or in a short time, be able to give us further information.<br><br>
I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to debate these matters and for the immense care and trouble taken to provide us with information. But that information needs to go further, and I shall make some requests during my brief remarks this morning.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Biggs-Davison</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The h. G.referred to the speech of my h. F. the M. for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) and suggested that he had gone beyond what he had said previously on behalf of our party. Can the h. G. say in what respect my h. F. has gone further?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not suggesting that the h. G. had gone further than he had gone before. I suggested that he may have gone further than his party has previously gone. I hope that the h. G. will soon make his view clear on the question of the future of local administration in Northern Ireland. I hope that we can have that made clear before long, if not this morning.<br><br>
I turn now to the question of public expenditure. First, there is a possibility that the r. h. M. for Down, South, in his pursuit of truth and clarity, may have made some error of judgment in that, while one hopes that Northern Ireland is in transition, it would be a mistake to describe what we ought to describe as taxes as such so we may as well maintain the continuity of the concept of rate.<br><br>
I accept the r. h. G's point that throughout the centuries we have sought alternatives to rates. In my own constituency in South Yorkshire in 1974, after the reorganisation and as a result of the system of local government reform which was applied in England, rates in my rural districts were brought up to the city areas around which they were distributed and we had rate increases of about 114 per cent. I recall spending most of my weekend evenings in those villages seeking to defend my Labour-controlled local authority which was being pilloried for the responsibility it bore as a result of Conservative local government reorganisation.<br><br>
For a considerable period then and since, there has been continuing bitterness, anger and frustration about rates, and people demand an alternative. I recognise that there is no easy alternative, certainly if
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
adequate responsibility and public ability to question local expenditure is to be retained at local level. Therefore, it would perhaps be better to maintain the term "rates" even though it is not strictly relevant.<br><br>
But I am concerned about the assumption that rating demands in Northern Ireland are comparable with the position obtaining in Yorkshire and Humberside. My constituency is in Yorkshire, and I had a great deal of experience—as other members of the Committee have had—on local government before I entered the House. I am somewhat concerned about the comparisons given in the larger document which my h. F. provided.<br><br>
11.25 a.m.<br><br>
It appears to suggest that the rate movement in Northern Ireland has kept pace with that in England, and certainly in Yorkshire and Humberside.<br><br>
My difficulty is that the figure is rather misleading because the base is not clearly stated. If we are talking about percentage increases each year, we need to know the precise position in the base year. I think that the percentage increases given in the document cover up the fact that, since the bases varied enormously at the beginning, the present comparison is not accurate.<br><br>
I do not claim to be particularly proficient in mathematics, but the rate support grant today in England and Wales is 61 per cent, and the grant implied in the documents now before us is 77.9 per cent. That suggests that the ratepayers—or taxpayers, if h. Ms. insist on that term—in Northern Ireland are getting an enormously better deal than are ratepayers in England and Wales. My h. F. ought to spell that out. It ought to be spelt out today, as it appears that several h. Gs. in the Committee will be voting tonight in theory and on the basis of sweeping cuts in public expenditure. We are entitled to know what sweeping cuts in public expenditure the Opposition want to see, as that is what they will be demanding this evening.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the h. G. will bear in mind, as I pointed out in my speech, that his denominator, his 420 names—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that it was 430.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged. Will the h. G. bear in mind that his denominator which
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0687">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
produces his 77 per cent rate support grant consists of items which are not fixed in Northern Ireland by local authorities as they are in England and Wales but are entirely decisions of the central Government and inevitably, therefore, include substantial elements which are not included in the comparable expenditure in local authority areas in England and Wales?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Hardy</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I think that that is true. I have looked at the relevant expenditure column in the section marked "4" in the file and have seen some of the figures to which the r. h. G. refers. But those figures are dwarfed by the expenditure on education. We ought to bear in mind that in Northern Ireland £198 million or more is spent on education, over £33 million on welfare, £50 million on roads, over £80 million on housing, and £36 million spent by the district councils, which may not include many of the items to which the r. h. G. rightly referred.<br><br>
It seems that under those headings we are providing a larger grant for greater spending in Northern Ireland than areas in Yorkshire and Humberside are receiving at present. That should be spelt out clearly by my h. F. I want to know, and my constituents are entitled to know, what support was given per head in Northern Ireland in the last year for which figures are available. I recognise that it is difficult to make current comparisons, but it should be possible to give a figure for 1977–78, and ideally it would be suitable to give a figure for 1978–79. I want to know the rate support grant per head for Northern Ireland in those years and the figure per head for local authorities in Yorkshire and Humberside. It would be a useful and topical figure.<br><br>
I hope that we can find out what is spent on education per head in Northern Ireland compared with Yorkshire and Humberside,
11.30 a.m.<br><br>
what is spent on welfare, on roads and on housing, and what is spent by the district councils. I say that because those figures do not include the items to which the r. h. G. refers. They must be excepted for Northern Ireland because of the special circumstances. But I do not believe that we should be doing our constituents a particularly good service if the information that I have just requested is not provided.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
I now make another point, and I think that my h. F. the M. for Hemsworth (Mr. Woodall) will understand the feeling which I express. Just as Northern Ireland has particular and appalling difficulties which are met to a large extent by central contributions—I speak of criminal damage to property—so we in the coalfields of Yorkshire suffer particularly from colliery subsidence. There is no special grant from the central Exchequer to cover the often bewildering, appalling and grievous suffering or damage which that experience engenders. We are told that it is something that we must accept as part of the economic legacy and responsibility of that which provides our people with their livelihood.<br><br>
But the fact remains that we have to provide finance for that purpose to a large extent from within—either from the industry or from the pockets and purses of the ratepayers—and the special circumstances which prevail in my constituency or in Hemsworth are not given special assistance from central funds. From that point of view, I think that we are right in properly requiring explanation of those items which may be most necessary items of expenditure in Northern Ireland but to which the British taxpayer rather than the Northern Ireland ratepayer contributes.<br><br>
As Northern Ireland is the beneficiary of enormously above average support from central funds, as the principle of" good, wise and necessary public spending is vitally relevant in Northern Ireland, and as Tory Ms. appear to be likely to repudiate that principle this evening, I think it appropriate that my h. F. should spell out the details as soon as possible. I recognise that it would be difficult to do so this morning. It would be churlish for me to seek to insist upon it, given the considerable trouble already taken by my h. F., but I believe that it would be useful for that information to be made available without delay.</span></p>
<p>11.34 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Craig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I enjoyed listening to my r. h. F. the M. for Down, South (Mr. Powell). I found it more entertaining to relate the situation to Lewis Carroll and "Alice in Wonderland" rather than to Swift and the experiences of Gulliver. I cannot think of any other situation in which, without laughing, one can pose the question "When is a rate not a rate?". According to the working party, a rate is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0688">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
not a rate when it is a levy. I cannot accept the thinking that lies behind the working party's report and the Government's acceptance of it.<br><br>
Of course, my r. h. F. was correct to indicate that this wonderland was created by the acceptance of the Macrory report. I never was in favour of it, I can never bring myself to be in favour of it, and I shall never be content until it is reversed and we have a proper system of local government capable of handling the services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCusker</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The r. h. G. was close to the centre of things when the decisions were made regarding the Macrory report. Could he enlighten us as to how the Northern Ireland Government ever came to be convinced that that was the right way forward? After all, it was Stormont that inflicted it upon us.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Craig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I happened to be a fierce opponent of those who inflicted this upon us. I never like to get at other people's motives, but I had a strong suspicion that the desire was not for the improvement of local government but to ensure that certain services would be kept under the control of certain people. But, I do not want to elaborate on that. History is history. It is getting it right now that matters.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would the r. h. G. agree with me that the body which brought to a head the Macrory report, or what we are discussing this morning, was not the Parliament but the Assembly?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Craig</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It was the Assembly that launched us on this strange taxation system relating to local services. We should return to this aspect because that is what we are concerned with. I agree with my r. h. F. that we shall never get it right until there is a reform of local government. If there were a Parliament of Northern Ireland tomorrow, that would still be so.<br><br>
11.35 a.m.<br><br>
We shall not get it right until either Stormont or this place reorganises local government in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
In recent years the Government in their different forms have failed. They have certainly failed to honour the intention of the Macrory report. In paragraph 141 the Macrory report made quite clear that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
<br><blockquote><p>"under these arrangements the cost of the regional services would appear in the estimates and accounts of Government departments concerned and be subject to annual Parliamentary approval."</p></blockquote>
The failure of the Department of Finance to discharge that responsibility has placed us in a difficult situation With all due respect to the Under-Secretary, I must join issue with him about his remarks in the preface to the working party report, where he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Thus Parliament became responsible for their adequacy, management and costs."</p></blockquote>
These functions were transferred and merged into the existing administrative departments of the Government of Northern Ireland, but that does not mean that Parliament became responsible for the adequacy and management of those functions. In my opinion, it is wrong to suggest that services of that nature can be adequately managed by Parliament. The executive Government may be answerable to Parliament, but it should never be represented that Parliament can be held responsible for the adequacy and management of these services.<br><br>
I cannot accept the argument that it was impossible to ascertain the cost because the rate-borne and other services were administered as one. Macrory clearly envisaged that the cost could have been ascertained. I accept his judgment. When I look at the way in which we were able to separate the different aspects of Northern Ireland's complicated tax arrangements, where we had such items as attributed revenue, I cannot be convinced that it would have been an onerous or costly task to discharge the responsibility of ascertaining the cost of the services.<br><br>
I cannot accept that the regional and district rates combined compare favourably with rate levels in Great Britain, because one has to be able to measure the quality of the services before it can be said that they compare favourably. I think that the Northern Ireland ratepayer is getting very bad value for money. I have watched services deteriorate in a way that I never thought would have been possible in Northern Ireland. We used to boast of the efficiency of our local services. One of the features of Northern Ireland used to be a well maintained and well developed road system. But it is now a classic example of how regionalisation of the road service has failed the country. It has not only
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0689">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
failed in providing us with well kept roads, but I am sure that it has been responsible for grossly extravagant expenditure.<br><br>
I should like to think that some formula can be found by which we know the cost of these services. Then it would be a simple matter of deciding how the bill for them is to be met. The rate will still be there and the rate support grant will still be there. But it is essential to know the cost—<br><br>
11.40 a.m.<br><br>
—and I should like that to be reexamined. If we are given costs, we shall have a much better way of letting the ratepayers know whether they are getting comparable value for their money.<br><br>
I do not think that the principle is disputed by any of us that, to use the Macrory words,
<br><blockquote><p>"there can be no net shift in financial responsibility from the rates to the Exchequer."</p></blockquote>
But we are entitled to see clearly how our rates are being spent, and I do not want them to be regarded as anything other than rates. It is a tax raised on the rateable value of the hereditaments where they are liable to taxation, and it should be distinguishable from the other revenues that go into the Consolidated Fund.<br><br>
Perhaps in the near future proposals will emerge from the restructuring of our local government and, as we set about that task, it will be necessary to ascertain those costs and know the rateable content of the bill. I ask the Minister to bear that in mind.<br><br>
Whatever our political views may be in Northern Ireland, there is a growing demand for local government to be restructured. People want more say in how their money is spent and in the quality of the services they receive. The report does not help us to make progress, and I ask for the matter to be reviewed again.</span></p>
<p>11.43 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are two matters that I should like to dwell upon by way of preface. The first is the inference by the Under-Secretary of State that Stormont was responsible for implementing the matter that we are
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
discussing. I do not want to misrepresent the Minister—he mentioned Stormont—but I should like to put on the record that this matter was finalised by the Assembly.<br><br>
The Minister referred in his opening speech to the fact that the head of the finance department of the Assembly, a Mr. Kirk, was responsible for the acceptance of this scheme. I accept that the scheme flows from the acceptance of the Macrory report, but as the h. G. is aware—and as the Committee should be aware, too—there was great opposition in the old Stormont Parliament to that report. Whereas the Government accepted it, it was not until 1973, during the reorganisation of local government, that they moved towards the present situation, when the Stormont Parliament was no longer in existence.<br><br>
The majority of people who think that direct rule is a mistake, and that what we need in Northern Ireland is a return to a provincial Government of the Province, feel strongly that local government should be reorganised by that body. It would be far better for a democratically elected Parliament of Northern Ireland to deal with the reorganisation of local government, and not for this House to set about a cosmetic exercise in trying to patch up local government, when we have no proper devolved Parliament and no proper devolved Government of Northern Ireland. That is the view of the people and it was the view expressed in the UUUC election manifesto, through which the Unionists came to this House. If h. Ms. refer to that manifesto they will see that our opinion was that the people who should reorganise local government were a devolved Parliament and a devolved Government in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Under the notional rate, it is impossible to give satisfaction to the people of Northern Ireland. It cannot be explained to people how they are getting justice and how justice can be seen to be done. I think that the Minister is well aware of that.<br><br>
In paragraph 9, on page 7 of the working party's report, we read:
11.45 a.m.
<br><blockquote><p>"The initial attraction of a return to a traditional expenditure-based regional rate has not been overlooked. Indeed some representatives on the working party pressed the view that this should be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0690">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
possible with appropriate accounting methods and was the only solution that would completely satisfy District Councillors and ratepayers."</p></blockquote>
I think it would be correct to say that the District Councillors have absolutely no say on this regional rate. I have great difficulty, when approaching them, in explaining how the regional rate is struck, as it is outside their jurisdiction.<br><br>
What I feel to be right—and this view has been put forward strongly this morning—is that we shall never satisfy the people on this matter until we return to proper local government. That local government, I believe, could be returned when the people of Northern Ireland have their own Parliament, not a Parliament envisaged to carry out the Macrory report but one that would be free to deal with this matter in the best interests of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
An h. M. asked for some figures, to which he is entitled. The people of Northern Ireland are not beggars. They are not poor Cinderellas sitting in the ashes in a part of the United Kingdom, asking for favours. They are prepared to carry their fair, full burden of responsibility within the United Kingdom family.<br><br>
While one side of the coin has been presented, there is another side to that coin—the value of the workers of Northern Ireland in its gross output through exports, which is very high. The workers in no way need to hang their heads in shame, as they can lead the whole of the United Kingdom in that regard. So we must balance the position. It is most essential that the contribution made by the people of Northern Ireland should not be overlooked or disparaged. That should be said and put on the record.<br><br>
In regard to obtaining one's money's worth when the money brought in by the regional rate is spent, I agree with the r. h. M. for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig). There is a serious deterioration in the infrastructure of Northern Ireland, which we can see in the roads network, particularly during severe weather, in the total failure to have roads made negotiable through no gritting being provided, and by the complete closedown of areas because of services that were heretofore available not now being available.<br><br>
It has been asked "If public expenditure is to be cut, how then can the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
Northern Ireland representatives ask for the spending of public money in Northern Ireland?" We need to realise that public money has been squandered there. I use the word "squandered deliberately. I think of the fiasco of the Strathearn Audio Company.<br><br>
11.50 a.m.<br><br>
I think of the millions of pounds poured into that company. Then at the end of the day the remaining workers get a golden handshake and the place closes down.<br><br>
I want to emphasise that it is in these matters that we need to have public scrutiny. Even on the Labour Benches some h. M.s have a question mark over the whole De Lorean enterprise, in case perhaps once again we have a Strathearn Audio fiasco on our hands. These are some of the matters that concern the people of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
H. G.s have also talked about immense leisure centres which have been built in Northern Ireland and other matters which could well have been put lower down the list to allow concentration upon priorities such as housing, the supply of water, sewerage and such necessary amenities. I should like to see the Government getting their priorities right. There could still be a cutback in public expenditure if the money that we have is wisely used. These, too, are matters that concern the people of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
We have before us today an impossible task, because there is no way out of this labyrinth except to put local government on a proper basis, with responsibility in Northern Ireland. I firmly believe that the only competent body to reorganise local government is not the House of Commons but a devolved Parliament and Government of Northern Ireland, where the people themselves can deal with this problem. I regret any departure from that principle which was embraced at the election and put in the manifesto of all the Unionist candidates elected to this House.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Powell</span><span class='membercontribution'>: While my h. F. has been speaking I have been reading the manifesto on which we both stood. There is no reference in it to local government.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The manifesto that we stood on was linked with the manifesto put to the convention. The members that are here agreed to the manifesto on which the convention members stood. Both manifestoes were endorsed by not only those who were standing but those who were in the parly party. That was the firm conviction of the UUUC at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. A. W. Stallard</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am following the h. G.'s remarks about the need for a different structure of government in Northern Ireland. He will know that I share broadly that view. But I find it difficult to reconcile that with his views recently expressed in the House that an increase in seats at Westminster, and therefore a move towards further direct rule and integration, is a priority, when he voted in favour of that rather than stressing the need for devolution. I think there is a contradiction in his two positions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to make it clear to the h. G.—I do not want to develop this now—that there is no contradiction between those two positions, because under the scheme devised by his own Government there would be no reduction if the Scottish people were to get their devolution. I believe that Scotland is his native land. I understand that there would be no reduction in the number of Members of Parliament attending this House, if Scotland had the devolved government envisaged by his own Government. It would hardly be likely that a representative from Northern Ireland would want anything less than parity. We are asking to be treated in the same way as it is proposed to treat Scotland and Wales.<br><br>
I was simply carrying out my duty and responsibility on which I stood as a candidate. We asked not for four or five seats but for 20. We asked for that as the elected representatives of Northern Ireland meeting in convention and deciding constitutionally that that was what we were entitled to. I am still convinced that it is what we are entitled to, and that we were sold short.<br><br>
11.55 p.m.<br><br>
However, I said in that debate that if I had to make a choice between increased
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
representation in the House and devolved government in Northern Ireland, I should choose devolved government. But we should not need to make that choice. If we were getting fair play in the House, we should be entitled to both. As has been underlined by other h. Ms., we are at an impasse. We cannot satisfy the people of Northern Ireland about this notional rate, because it is impossible to show that justice has been done and has been seen to be done. Nevertheless, we must carry the proposals because the Government are not able to say, when they are setting a rate, that so much will be spent and therefore a percentage of that figure must be raised by this regional rate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Stan Thorne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the h. G.'s comments, would he now accept that, with greater representation and with parity of representation to other parts of the United Kingdom—since he is concerned with British questions generally— that the whole of Britain should vote in a referendum concerning the future of Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to tell the h. G. that I am firmly on record about that very point. I have made it perfectly clear that if the United Kingdom wants to reject Northern Ireland, it should make that plain. I have said "Let the whole nation vote on this issue". If Northern Ireland is put out of the United Kingdom family in that manner we shall be happy to go our own way. However, we shall not go into a United Ireland; let me make that clear.<br><br>
The h. G. is only echoing what I have already said. If the rest of the family do not want us, let them say it in a democratic manner, and let the parting of the ways come. There are a lot of people in Northern Ireland who feel that, under direct rule they are being edged, not merely out of the United Kingdom, but into some settlement for a united Ireland, which is totally abhorrent to the majority.<br><br>
I am glad that the h. G. has raised that very interesting point. I should like to see the people of the three kingdoms make a decision on the issue and settle the matter once and for all. No one in Northern Ireland likes to be treated as a second class, third class, or sometimes fifth class citizen. We are

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 29</span>
entitled to what we receive within the United Kingdom family. If the others do not want us in the family, let them say so democratically and the Ulster people will then make their own decision but not for a united Ireland.</span></p>
<p>11.59 a.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Like all other members of the Committee, I welcome the chance of examining the rating system in Northern Ireland. I have read with great interest the contents of the folder which was very kindly sent to us, especially the working party report.<br><br>
In passing, I should like to direct the attention of the h. M. for Rother Valley (Mr. Hardy) to the statement on page 10 that households in Northern Ireland are much larger on average than the rest of the United Kingdom, and to that on page 11, which says that household incomes— and, I assume, household sizes—are not taken into account when rating policy is decided.<br><br>
However, those factors could not possibly weigh very much on a valuation officer, except that in the fixing of net annual values he must take the believed possible rentals into account. That is the basis on which the valuation is fixed. Surely those values should reflect to some degree the economic circumstances of the area in question.<br><br>
That leads me on to a great bone of contention about the rating system in Northern Ireland. Those present at previous debates on Northern Ireland rates will recall that a number of h. Ms. have raised the problems that have resulted from levying a regional rate over all the districts in Northern Ireland, when similar premises have different values in different districts.<br><br>
12 noon<br><br>
This matter was thoroughly explored, and it is a matter of which the Committee should be reminded today. It brings into the regional rate an inequity that cannot be defended, yet it has persisted since the regional rate and the present system were introduced because valuation officers have different views.<br><br>
The valuation is perfectly fair within the district—and, therefore, to the district rate in that area—but it is unfair when the layer of the regional rate is added to
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
it. It is not then being levied on a completely equitable basis. That, I think, has been overlooked this morning, and I want the Minister to know that we have not forgotten about it.<br><br>
This morning we have largely ignored the rates levied by the district council. They cover the general administration of the district—recreation grounds, parks, arts councils, art galleries, museums, swimming pools, public baths, licences of various kinds, regional community centres, environmental health, clean air, street cleaning, refuse collection, building regulations, certain housing grants and subsidies, markets, abattoirs, tourist amenities, burial grounds, public toilets, and so on.<br><br>
We should recognise that all the services come directly under the control of the district councils. Not many decisions have to be taken by the councils in this respect. Their administration is a purely technical mechanical function. A decision would have to be taken early in the day whenever a new service or a new facility was provided. But once the decision is taken and that service or facility is under way, the council members have little to do with it.<br><br>
If the organisation and management structure is correct, the thing practically runs itself. In short, few important decisions have to be taken about anything that is provided by a district council more than once. The decision is taken once, and that is generally the end of it.<br><br>
The problem that I see in providing all these facilities—the h. M. for Antrim, North (Rev. Ian Paisley) referred to recreation facilities in particular—is that they have expanded enormously in the past three years. I question how many more will be provided. I believe that we are near the end of the road here. First, the provision in the pipeline or already provided is probably sufficient. Secondly, to go much further is to create a burden on the district rate that will be unbearable.<br><br>
I do not believe that we can go on and on. Even allowing for the fact that councillors can give an explanation and that we know the cost down to the last penny in the pound and, therefore, the sum needed and the rate that has to be struck, not everybody uses these facilities. Not everybody kicks a football, not everybody goes swimming, not everybody plays squash. There is a great deal of resent-
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0693">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
ment among that section of the community—much the largest section—which makes little or no use of the facilities for which it has to pay. There is a ground-swell of opinion against the constant provision of more and more facilities for what, in any given case, must be for a small minority of the population. This matter should not be lightly cast aside.<br><br>
On top of all that, I suspect that money from general taxation will diminish in the years ahead.<br><br>
12.05 p.m.<br><br>
When that happens I think there will be more trouble, especially since at the last valuation the burden of rates shifted from domestic dwellings to commercial property.<br><br>
I fear for the business people because of that and question whether it was wise to make a conscious shift in the burden. If business people are squeezed more and more in the years ahead, prices will rise and will have to be passed on to the consumer. That is what the man in the street does not understand.<br><br>
On top of all that, there is the difference between domestic and non-domestic premises. We know how money is spent on the local rate, but the regional rate is totally different. It finances roads, water, sewerage, health and education. We do not know how much of the rate is spent on each item. The public do not understand the system. There is no yardstick by which either the elector or the councillor can measure the efficiency of the services provided. They cannot even argue how the money should be distributed. When things go wrong the council and the councillor are blamed, despite the fact that they have no power to alter a single dot or cross a single "t" in these functions. The councillor is unable to give a reason; there is no breakdown of sums, no percentage related to a single item of expenditure. In other words, there is no accountability. It is false, in practice, to say that the accountability of Ministers is understood in any degree by the ordinary men and women in the street who provide the money.<br><br>
This is no light matter. Ratepayers used to be able to raise questions with councillors about waste and bungling. They usually got an answer and they usually got action as well. The councillor
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
now says that it is not his work or that he will take up the matter when he next meets the manager involved with roads, water or housing. Those managers can give a bland answer and get away with it because the councillor has no right to ask to examine details of expenditure. He has no right to ask in the same way as a councillor in Great Britain. There is no way in which a councillor in Northern Ireland can measure the performance and efficiency of those who run the services against that of their predecessors under the old council system.<br><br>
I believe that what I said about roads and water can be applied equally to housing, which has always been an emotive subject in Northern Ireland. That is wrong. Councils, because they are under constant pressure from ratepayers, tend to spend money more efficiently than do the Government who have to spend it, so to speak, at arm's length. I dislike the system. The more I look at it the more I believe that the regional rate, at the very least, should be broken down and the money distributed according to some clearly recognised formula. That would give district councillors something to get their teeth into where at present there is nothing. People should know that X pence in the pound goes to roads, education, or whatever, if that were so, they would take a greater interest and would press their representatives on the local boards.<br><br>
It must be our objective that the control of the system is put into local hands again and taken out of the hands of the Minister. I believe that that is the only way that Northern Ireland people can decide how the money shall be spent locally. When I say "people" I mean elected people. I do not wish to see boards appointed by the Minister so that those appointed do not have to ask the people, every three, four, or five years to condemn or justify what they have done.<br><br>
12.10 p.m.<br><br>
We want to get back to a system where those who spend the money are responsible to the electorate at elections rather than being responsible to the Minister. It is wrong that the people of Northern Ireland are denied the right to run their own affairs.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
Finally, I quote from paragraph 16 of Cmd. 517 of December 1967, which reads:
<br><blockquote><p>"The bases upon which the reshaping of Northern Ireland's local government was proposed to be established included efficiency."</p></blockquote>
which in my view does not exist
<br><blockquote><p>"economy"</p></blockquote>
which in my view is sadly lacking:
<br><blockquote><p>"and the effective representation of local aspirations.",</p></blockquote>
which simply has not happened. It is time—indeed, the time is long past, for changes to be made.</span></p>
<p>12.11 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. James Kilfedder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the debate on the Northern Ireland Appropriation order on the Floor of the House I roundly and bluntly condemned the present rating system in Northern Ireland as being totally undemocratic, unfair and intolerable. Listening to our debate this morning—and for some strange reason h. Ms. seem to be distracted by what is going on somewhere else in the Palace of Westminster—I have become convinced that this Government and, indeed, perhaps their Conservative successor if there is an election, offer no hope to the people of Northern Ireland of getting rid of the system that we have and providing justice for the people of Northern Ireland and a rate level which is tolerable for householders in the Province.<br><br>
The system we have forced on us would not be entertained by a Westminster Government for any other region in the United Kingdom, so why should we tolerate it for Northern Ireland? We had civil right marches for one man one vote many years ago, but I believe that this system, based on what councillors elsewhere in the United Kingdom determine, is utterly repugnant to what this Parliament and British justice are supposed to stand for.<br><br>
Perhaps it is time that the people of Northern Ireland rid themselves of their complacency, decided to act and made sure that this Westminster Parliament and Government, or their successors, realise that they will not be complacent much longer about colonial direct rule with such consequences as the present rating system.<br><br>
It seems that what is unacceptable to any other region in the United Kingdom
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
can be maintained in Northern Ireland, despite the fact that Ulster ratepayers have a punishing amount to pay. There is no element of democratic control over the regional rate. Macrory envisaged that the Stormont Parliament would provide the element of democratic control which ensured that ratepayers' money was sensibly and carefully used to provide value for money. This could be guaranteed only by the keeping of proper accounts of the costs of the regional services in the same way as district councils must show how money is spent.<br><br>
Public accountability by district councils means that the ratepayers, if displeased with the manner of dispersal of their money, can kick out the district councillors at the next local government elections. How can Ulster ratepayers monitor the regional rate expenditure on rate borne matters in Northern Ireland?<br><br>
12.15 p.m.<br><br>
They could do so if proper accounts were kept, but proper accounts are not kept. Contrary to the fundamental principle that ratepayers and taxpayers should be able to discover how their money is spent, no proper accounts are available for ratepayers in Northern Ireland in respect of the regional rate.<br><br>
Indeed, under the unfair system imposed on the Province, there is no way in which the Government or the bureaucracy can pretend that the heavy rates paid by Ulster people have any relevance to expenditure in Northern Ireland. As I have pointed out in the House on a number of occasions, the regional rate paid by Ulster ratepayers is fixed not by district councillors in Northern Ireland—that would be too just, too fair—but by district councillors in the North-East of England. That is a disgraceful position which I do not intend to tolerate.<br><br>
The excuse of the bureaucracy is that the Government find it impossible to keep accounts of the cost of regional services, because the regional services have been absorbed into Stormont departments. The tax revenues of Northern Ireland are merged with the rest of the United Kingdom, but that does not prevent the Northern Ireland amount being calculated by the Civil Service. It means that it has to go to some trouble to be able to attribute the correct amount of money,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0695">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
but I believe that the people of Northern Ireland are entitled to expect that the Government and the bureaucracy should go to this trouble to ensure that people realise how much money is being spent and for what.<br><br>
A suggestion has been made that the level of rates in Northern Ireland should be linked to the average level of rates in Great Britain and that whenever a change in the rate occurs in Great Britain, a similar percentage increase would be made in the Northern Ireland regional rate. But that suggestion takes no account of whether the services in Northern Ireland are on the same level as those in Great Britain and it ignores the fact that standards were not the same to start with as between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.<br><br>
The h. M. for Londonderry (Mr. Ross) in his speech condemned the creation of leisure centres. He stated that the people in Northern Ireland did not want them. He cannot justify such a ridiculous statement, except on the basis, as he says, that he does not play squash or engage in the other activities pursued at leisure centres. But he is a public representative. He should think of all the other people who will enjoy themselves. Or does he and his h. F.'s believe that the people of Northern Ireland should not enjoy themselves? Do they intend to keep costs down, close the leisure centres, throw the young people out on the streets, prevent husband and wife, mother and family, mother and father from bringing their youngsters along to these leisure centres?<br><br>
I do not want to see young people thrown out on the streets. I make this protest, which I have made often enough. I want to see leisure centres created in Down North. My protest is that they have not been created there. I am not suggesting that they should be closed elsewhere. I want those leisure centres created in Down North, so that these young people who have nowhere else to go except the public houses can enjoy reasonable recreation. The young people of Northern Ireland deserve a better deal than that envisaged by the h. M. for Londonderry and his colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the h. G. understand that I was referring to provision
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
far beyond what I believe is necessary? I draw to his attention the fact that certain sports and pastimes in Northern Ireland receive no help from public funds whatsoever. A good many people who participate in them have asked me why no money is spent on their pastimes.</span></p>
<p>12.20 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kilfedder</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That intervention confirms what I said earlier about the h. G.'s stand and the stand of his group.<br><br>
The people of Northern Ireland turn their backs on the old-type politicians. They want to see public representatives who will do some good for them and who will provide a community and services of which they can be proud. Therefore, they need the rates spent wisely and properly, not wasted.<br><br>
I do not believe that it is a waste of money to create leisure centres for adults and the young. I wish the bureaucratics would go to some of the places in my constituency, such as Bangor, New-townards, Comber and Carryduff, and see young people wandering around, not knowing what to do or where to go. If they had leisure centres, the young people would be able to get off the streets and enjoy themselves properly. Our future is bound up with those young people and it should be our task to make life better for them. I do not believe that this Government are doing that. I have grave doubts whether their successors will do so either.</span></p>
<p>12.20 p.m.</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When I began this debate I said that the question of a regional rate was not easy to answer. The debate has borne out my words.<br><br>
This has been an interesting debate, certainly from the Government's point of view, as we initially responded to the request for it because we wanted to find out what the elected representatives in Northern Ireland, in particular, were saying on this subject. I am grateful for the contributions to the debate.<br><br>
We are in a consultative period. I am thankful that not too many specific questions were put to me, because as we are virtually in the middle of this consultative period it would be wrong for the Government to pre-empt what they
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1978-1979V004P0I0696">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
may say at the end of May, when the full consultation period has been completed.<br><br>
I should like to answer one or two of the points that have been raised. The h. M. for Abingdon (Mr. Neave) questioned the period that the working party spent on this subject—three and a half years. It was first set up as an inter-Departmental committee. It made an interim report in 1976. But it felt that it should be enlarged and that local authority representatives should be included. That was done and the final report was published in 1978. Unfortunately, the initial chairman, Dr. Dent, died in 1977 and there was some delay as a result.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Win. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us whether the local government representatives were councillors—representatives of the people—or the officials and servants of the councils?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That brings me to the h. G.'s second point, which I was about to answer. The Association of Local Authorities nominated five representatives. They were clerks of their councils. There were six civil servants and the chairman. That answers the question concerning composition raised by the h. M. for Abingdon.<br><br>
The h. G. also asked whether the views of local authority representatives were overruled by the civil servants. Generally speaking, the local authority representatives were in favour of an expenditure-based rate. After discussions they specifically came round to the view of the majority and agreed with the majority report.<br><br>
A question was raised by the h. G. about the Lord Mayor of Belfast's letter to the <i>Belfast Telegraph.</i> It was specifically geared to a new local government situation in Northern Ireland. The Macrory report was geared to the existing situation, and financing that is a different matter. It would be premature for the Government to presuppose that there will be a particular kind of local government in the future. Therefore, we should look at the structure before anything like the Layfield committee looks into the financing of local government structured in that way.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
12.25 p.m.<br><br>
I believe that the last point raised by the h. M. concerned paragraph 38 of the report—how the Department of Finance was to show how the rates money was spent. The tables to the report show the services towards which the regional rate makes a contribution and what proportion of the total cost is borne by the regional rate. If the h. M. wishes to look at the tables I shall not close the discussion, and if we may enter into discussions on the matter in the usual way I shall be happy to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although I have looked at what was said, I raised the question whether there would be any separate accounting which would link regional services.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall look at the <i>Official Report</i> and answer the h. G.'s point.<br><br>
The final question was why earlier comparisons were made with the North-East of England but not with Scotland. The answer is that it was considered that the household income levels in North-East England were most comparable with the position of Northern Ireland. In Scotland the valuations are done locally, whereas in England and Wales they are done centrally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Neave</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Another point was the question of water rates.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is another point that I shall look into.<br><br>
The r. h. M. for Down, South (Mr. Powell) made a very interesting contribution, and I am sorry that he is not present.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Where is he?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Pendry</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The r. h. G. asked me about a specific point. The report was submitted in August 1978 but was not made available until February this year. Between August and February the report was being considered by the various Departments of the Government, and I should have thought that that was not an unusual time. Since then we have ensured that we have a longer period for debate and discussion than is usual, and I believe that to be the most important factor.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
My h. F. the M. for Rother Valley (Mr. Hardy) questioned the amount of rate support grant and asked whether it was high in Northern Ireland. The contrast between the rate support grant of 61 per cent, average in England and Wales and a notional 78 per cent, in Northern Ireland is a measure, I believe, of the needs and resources in Northern Ireland compared with the average in England and Wales. However, my h. F. kindly said that I would probably not be able to satisfy him this morning, and I am sure he was right. I shall go into this in more depth with my h. F. at a later date.<br><br>
The r. h. M. for Belfast, East (Mr. Craig)—who is present—referred to paragraph 141 of the Macrory report and to the failure of the Department of Finance to show estimates. I believe that the regional rate was to be pooled with other Government revenue to meet the cost of all Government services, and it was recognised that both the traditional central Government services and those taken over would become closely integrated as time went on and that the regional rate was essentially a balancing factor. I do not know whether that answers the r. h. G.'s specific point, but I shall be only too happy to look again at the <i>Official Report</i> as we are in this period of consultation.<br><br>
The h. M. for Londonderry made a thoughtful speech. Obviously, he is</span></p>

<p>close to the ground and particularly understands the problems of his district councillors. He raised a number of points and at one stage said that the valuation measure was not uniform in Northern Ireland when net annual valuations were taken. The net annual value in any area reflects the local rent values of a particular area, which perhaps answers that point. I should like to reflect on other points made by the h. M.</p>

<p>I conclude by once more thanking the members of the Committee for truly participating in the real spirit of consultation on a very difficult and complex matter.
