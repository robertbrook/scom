<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that the debate may continue until 4.30 pm.</span></p>
<p>2.45 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (Ms Rosie Winterton)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the proposal for a draft Access to Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2002.</p></blockquote>
This is my first appearance in this Committee, which nearly did not sit this afternoon, and I am delighted that you are in the Chair, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
Today's debate is part of the consultation process on access to justice, which started four years ago. I shall go into some detail, but I hope to leave hon. Members with a clear sense of our direction and to take away their views as part of the consultation process.<br><br>
I shall set out a little of the background to our reform of the legal aid system in Northern Ireland. When we came into office in 1997, the Lord Chancellor expressed concern about several aspects of the legal aid scheme both in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland. We undertook a review of the legal aid scheme in England and Wales, and that resulted in the Access to Justice Act 1999. In Northern Ireland, we were conscious that there had been no substantial reform of legal aid since the Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (Northern Ireland) Order 1981. That order was, even then, a consolidating order, and remains the legislation governing legal aid in Northern Ireland today. We therefore initiated a fundamental review of legal aid, and a major consideration has been the distinctive culture in Northern Ireland legal services. Hon. Members will be aware that 80 per cent, of firms of solicitors in Northern Ireland have only one or two partners. Practices tend to be generalist, meeting all their clients' legal needs, but they are often highly dependent on legal aid income.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I interrupt the Minister before she moves on from the subject of Northern Ireland solicitors. I dare say that she will have received communications and representations from the Law Society of Northern Ireland. I am, of course, not its spokesman, but it is not best pleased. Will she comment on its submissions?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly refer to both points made by the Law Society of Northern Ireland and the consultation process, in which it has participated.<br><br>
The Bar in Northern Ireland is organised through the Bar Library, which is centralised and works in its own distinctive way. Hon. Members will also be aware
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
that there is a well-established fixed costs structure in Northern Ireland, particularly in the county court.<br><br>
The review of publicly funded legal services in Northern Ireland, which has given rise to the proposed legislation, has not taken place in a vacuum. In England and Wales, legal aid has been reformed by the Legal Aid Act 1988 and the Access to Justice Act 1999. Those reforms in England and Wales have provided a wealth of practical experience and knowledge, which has been used to inform the reform programme being considered for Northern Ireland. At the heart of that reform programme is a desire to deliver a modern, transparent and publicly funded legal services system that is flexible, but also takes account of local factors in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister refers to the experiences in England and Wales, but I understand that there have been some less happy experiences there. Have they been considered in drawing up the draft, or will they be considered in the final draft? The Minister referred to the peculiar situation of Northern Ireland, but is she aware that our erstwhile colleague Harold McCusker, during a debate in this place, suggested that when a solicitor was earning £250,000 a year from legal aid, he should become a public defender?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I was not aware of that particular comment. I believe that the changes in England and Wales have enabled us to examine exactly how some methods have worked, and how they can be translated to Northern Ireland. We have stated our intentions in certain areas, saying, "This is how we are going to start off to see whether we can make a slightly different system work". In many areas, which I shall discuss a little later, we have kept the power to introduce exactly the same system as in England and Wales if other systems fail, but we have also tried to ensure that the systems proposed fit into the distinctive culture. I hope that that will become clear during my speech.<br><br>
Part of the reasoning behind some of our conclusions is an acknowledgment that, because there has not been substantial reform of publicly funded legal services for at least two decades, we must move carefully. We have sought to engage with interested parties throughout the reform programme, and I take the opportunity to pay tribute to all those who have participated in the consultation process. Since our Green Paper, "Public Benefit and the Public Purse" was published in 1999, there has been a whole series of meetings, including with representatives of the profession such as the Law Society. That process has been engaged, constructive and, in many cases, informed.<br><br>
Some organisations would like the system to remain largely the same as at present, and some, including the Law Society, perhaps do not wish the reforms to go in quite the direction that we are planning. However, I hope that I shall be able to explain why we feel it necessary to move in that direction.<br><br>
In the course of our consultation, we have had the benefit of the report from the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which was included in our White Paper, "The Way Ahead". We have also had the benefit of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0602">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
the Northern Ireland Assembly's very detailed report on the proposed legislation.<br><br>
I stress again that I do not feel that an English model has been imported into Northern Ireland, and I shall give a couple of examples of the way in which we have tried to respond to the particular situation in the Province. As I said, at this stage our stated intention is to work to introduce a standard fee structure instead of the contracting system that applies in England and Wales. Having listened to the views of consultees, we are using the quality standard mechanism of a registration scheme and a code of practice. We have tried to take on board the points of view that have been expressed and to reflect them in our proposals.<br><br>
The Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission, as the purchaser of legal services—at public expense, but for the public—must have the flexibility and opportunity to provide different services in different ways. The available options are largely the same as those in England, but we expect the commission to exercise them very differently in Northern Ireland. I stress that we want to leave such matters for the commission to advise on in due course. Some people have criticised the proposals, saying that all the detail should be worked out now, but we want the commission to operate very much within the Northern Ireland context so that it reflects in its work the particular needs of the Province.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>David Burnside <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: As regards the establishment of the commission, I am sure that the Minister will agree that it needs independence and integrity. Following Sinn Fein-IRA's recent infiltration into the very heart of the Northern Ireland civil service and the Northern Ireland Office, will she give a commitment to enhance the integrity of the commission so that the standard of security vetting of its membership and staff will be of the highest Home Office standard, not of the low standard that presently exists in the Northern Ireland Office?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take on board the hon. Gentleman's point. I can certainly confirm that we want to ensure that the commission is independent, but also that it has the necessary expertise to develop its policies—and to advise on ours—so that they reflect the needs of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The objectives for reform that we set out in the consultation paper are to put in place appropriate funding arrangements to secure for citizens access to the most appropriate means of resolving legal issues; to target resources on those in greatest need; to ensure that the overall cost of legal aid is affordable and controllable; to secure value for money from quality legal services; and to establish the most effective and efficient administrative structure to deliver publicly funded legal services. The proposed legislation sets the framework for meeting those objectives over the coming years.<br><br>
I shall deal with some of the proposals in the order, starting with the establishment of a new body to administer publicly funded legal services. The Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission—a non-departmental public body—will assume responsibility for purchasing legal services in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
Northern Ireland from the funds set aside by Parliament for that purpose. Secondly, powers will be taken to regulate the cost of publicly funded legal services. We will move to establish a controlled budget for civil legal services and we will develop a range of all-inclusive standard fees that will cover work undertaken at public expense. Thirdly, a registration scheme and code of practice will be created. All individuals and organisations that provide services paid for by the commission will have to be registered with the commission and comply with a code of practice.<br><br>
The proposed draft order also contains provisions that offer the potential for cases to be funded outside the civil legal services fund. In England and Wales, conditional fee agreements, which are commonly called no win, no fee agreements, are a well-established feature of the legal services landscape. The proposal for the draft order will allow those agreements to be introduced in Northern Ireland. The proposed legislation also contains a provision that would enable a private fund to be established to fund cases that might be excluded from the scope of the civil legal services fund.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the point that the Minister is making, but what protection is available to my constituents who had a case brought against them by a person using legal aid who said that she had caught her hand in a letterbox delivering a freebie? Under the merit principle, my constituents—ordinary working people who own their own home—had to pay £800 up front for legal aid to defend themselves. The person who brought the case withdrew it, but my constituents were not refunded the £800.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Did the hon. Gentleman write to me about that case?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I took it up in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps the hon. Gentleman mentioned it to me in passing in the House. I am not sure of the details of the case, but I am happy to write to him if that would help. We have to accept the general principle that conditional fee agreements give access to justice that they did not previously have to many people who do not qualify for legal aid but do not have the private means to take a case forward.<br><br>
The case involving the constituent of the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) might be changed by the Legal Services Commission's assessment of which cases should be prioritised for legal aid. I do not know, because I am not sure of the details of that case. The proposed system would enable the commission to consider types of cases. Having considered local needs, talked to people about local priorities, consulted the professions and so on, it would be able to say, "Yes, this is the type of case that requires public funds." The hon. Gentleman's constituents' case might be subject to a different kind of agreement. As I said, I am not clear on all the details and I shall be happy to respond in writing if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Nigel Dodds <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister talked about conditional fee agreements improving access to justice for certain categories of plaintiffs. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0603">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
am sure that she is aware of the Lord Chancellor's Legal Aid Advisory Committee report on the matter, which stated:
<br><blockquote><p>"To the extent that CFAs in England and Wales have excluded weak cases available studies indicate that they exclude all but the virtually certain cases."</p></blockquote>
What is the Minister's opinion of the committee's view? Some anecdotal and other evidence indicates that the agreements have not worked as well in England and Wales as people thought they would.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The evidence is two-fold. The principle of providing for people who would not otherwise be able to access justice is important. Certainly the number of people who have been able to pursue cases and get justice, where they previously would not have been able to, has increased. The problem could be tackled from the other end as well. We have to judge whether we can free up money—we believe that in Northern Ireland the amount would be about £1.5 million—from the civil legal aid budget and put it into other places.<br><br>
We have noted the report of the Lord Chancellor's Legal Aid Advisory Committee and have in fact commissioned further work on the viability of a privately funded contingency legal aid fund in Northern Ireland. However, we feel that conditional fee agreements can certainly provide a fairer way for people to access justice. Obviously, in some situations, agreements can be reached through insurance companies, for instance, to deal with the point that the hon. Gentleman made about the very high rate of success that might be required. We are weighing very carefully the various views on the proposals for conditional fee agreements and CLAFs.<br><br>
The establishment of the commission will effect a transfer of statutory responsibility for the administration of publicly funded legal services from the Law Society to the commission. That is consistent with the approach taken in England and Wales at the end of the 1980s. The establishment of the commission has been widely welcomed and is a prerequisite to facilitating the research, consultation, analysis and pilot schemes that will be required to implement the reforms that we are suggesting in legislation. The proposed legislation sets the future reform of legal aid in the context of a high-quality, value-for-money service that will be implemented not wholesale but on a gradual and developing basis.<br><br>
The draft order clearly sets out the knowledge and experience that will be required from members of the commission, including knowledge of the provision of civil legal services or criminal defence services, the work of the courts, consumer affairs, social conditions and management. Appointments will be by open competition. We hope that the members of the commission will bring a breadth of experience and knowledge to the whole spectrum of the commission's responsibilities, including judgments on how to get the best value for money and on how to ensure the quality of the services that will be provided.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
<p><span class='member'>David Burnside</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give a commitment that competition for the membership of the commission will be truly open, fair and based on a meritocracy, and not reflective of anything else in Northern Ireland society?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A great deal of effort is being made to ensure that we find the very best people to undertake this important work, and we want the process to be open, fair and transparent. It is important that the commission is able to have an independent view of how best to provide legal services to the public in Northern Ireland at public expense.<br><br>
The commission will be independent, but it will be subject to policy directions given by the Lord Chancellor. However, it will be empowered to give the Lord Chancellor any advice that it may consider appropriate on matters relating to any of its functions. The Lord Chancellor will, as he must, retain overall responsibility for policy, but he will be able to give the commission guidance and direction. That reflects the need for the Lord Chancellor to be in a position to ensure that the priorities for, and the administration of, publicly funded legal services are consistent with the overall objectives of the democratically elected Government of the day.<br><br>
The legislation will require the commission to ensure that its advice to the Lord Chancellor and any decisions that it makes are properly informed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dodds</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A review of public administration was under way at the time of the suspension of devolved institutions in Northern Ireland and, as I understand it, is continuing. Given that another non-departmental public body will be set up, what are the likely administration costs of that body? Are any figures available?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the first year, we anticipate that the start-up costs will be approximately £700,000. Overall, we believe that the system will lead to greater cost-effectiveness because of the number of people who will benefit from the establishment of the commission and the reforms that we are introducing.<br><br>
The proposed legislation will lead to research-based decision making, and the commission will be required to conduct research into the profile of legal need throughout the jurisdiction. That is a very important principle in what we are trying to achieve, and it is at the heart of our policy. Targeting social need is a stated priority, and without the legislation it would be difficult to reform legal aid in such a way as to meet those targets of social need. There are currently important areas of advice and assistance, including social welfare issues, which do not always get the best out of publicly funded legal services. We should like to redirect funds towards those important services that can make a significant difference to the circumstances of many individuals in Northern Ireland. The commission could work with other agencies to develop a co-ordinated approach to funding that vital work. Progress on such an important initiative would be dependent on releasing funds spent in other areas by publicly funded legal services.<br><br>
I am sure that hon. Members will have noticed that many of the not-for-profit organisations that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0604">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
responded to the proposals welcomed the fact that the commission will be able to ensure that access to vital advice on housing, welfare benefits and other areas is opened up to the people of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
That may mean using funds that have previously been directed to other areas, which brings me to the second strand of the reform proposals: taking control of the cost of providing publicly funded legal services. Hon. Members know that expenditure has risen from £12.19 million in 1991 to £41.53 million in 2001–02, which is a real-terms increase of 149 per cent. Given the amount of public money devoted to publicly funded legal services, it is vital that it is used to secure legal services for the most meritorious actions and for actions that are of most importance to the individual citizen and the community. I am thinking of cases concerning children and the life and liberty of the applicant.<br><br>
Resources are finite and it is not feasible for publicly funded legal services to continue to increase on a purely demand-led basis. To address that, the proposed legislation will introduce three important measures. The first is the establishment of a controlled budget for civil legal services, which will be informed by an analysis of the need for, and the availability of, legal services. That proposal, which is established practice in England and Wales, will bring publicly funded legal services into line with other areas of public expenditure that have finite budgets.<br><br>
The second measure will complement a controlled civil legal services budget by establishing a funding code, which will contain the criteria to be used in determining whether civil legal services should be provided in a particular place. Under the proposal, the Lord Chancellor will set the Government's priorities for civil legal services. The priorities set for Northern Ireland will reflect local needs, and may closely resemble priorities set for England and Wales: the real and immediate risk of loss of life or liberty; social welfare issues including debt, employment rights, benefit entitlement and housing; domestic violence; welfare of children; and proceedings against public authorities alleging serious wrongdoing, abuse of position or power, or significant breach of human rights.<br><br>
The proposed funding code will introduce flexibility in assessing applications for funding by enabling different criteria to be applied to different categories of case according to their priority. The funding code will therefore play a vital role in ensuring that priority cases receive funding and in managing the controlled budget for civil legal services.<br><br>
The third measure is the development of new remuneration provisions that will enable all-inclusive standard fees to be developed for all aspects of publicly funded legal services. The proposed legislation makes provision for exceptional cases to be remunerated outside the proposed standard fee structure, which uses all-inclusive fees for all aspects of a case or piece of advice. It is envisaged that the vast majority of legal issues brought at public expense will be remunerated by reference to standard fees. There will be provision for funding of exceptional cases, but exceptional will mean exceptional.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
That approach will enable the Government to obtain a much clearer view of the funds required for publicly funded legal services in Northern Ireland on a year-on-year basis. It will also give practitioners certainty about the amounts that they receive in payment for their services, and it will speed up the payment process by simplifying the assessment procedures. The proposed remuneration provisions will be developed in a structured manner, commencing with remuneration for criminal defence services.<br><br>
The final strand of the proposed legislation which I draw to the Committee's attention is the proposal to enable the Lord Chancellor to establish a registration scheme and code of practice. The code will set out defined levels of service to the client that those providing legal services at public expense will be required to meet. The proposal will bring to bear on services provided as part of publicly funded legal services the scrutiny applied in many areas funded from the public purse.<br><br>
Under the proposal, all firms, bodies and individuals who wish to provide publicly' funded legal services will have to be registered and comply with the code of practice. We will audit compliance to ensure that the public get the standard of service to which they are entitled. Only firms and individuals who satisfy the quality standards will be entitled to provide publicly funded legal services.<br><br>
The proposed legislation will also enable the Lord Chancellor to make regulations in respect of codes of practice for different types of work. The proposed system will include compliance monitoring, which could result in sanctions being imposed should noncompliance be found. We will be interested to hear hon. Members' views on how a code of practice would work. For example, what sanctions and incentives might be built in to the running of the registration scheme to encourage high standards? It is important that we build quality into the services being offered.<br><br>
I am sure that hon. Members will be interested to know our thinking on the important subject of implementation—a matter that was raised previously. Throughout our consultation, we were clear that it would be neither appropriate nor desirable to contemplate implementing all the proposed reforms at the same time. We consistently stated that the Government's immediate priority would be the establishment of the Legal Services Commission. We strongly believe that that is the right step and we are pleased that we have had agreement in principle from our consultees on that matter. It is envisaged, however, that the reform of civil and criminal legal services will be taken forward when the commission is established and is ready to engage in the reform process. The commission is key and the legislation needs to set out the framework within which the commission will operate.<br><br>
We are committed to consultation and that commitment is undiminished. The commission must play a pivotal role in the localised working out of the detailed policies of reform for publicly funded legal services. Many of the positions set out in the proposed legislation—including the funding code and the registration scheme regulations—can begin to be
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0605">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
developed with the commission, alongside detailed research, analysis, consultation and pilot schemes. To develop those policies without the involvement of the commission would be wrong in principle and counterproductive in practice.<br><br>
The implementation plan that I will lay before Parliament with the draft order will ensure that the commission is at the heart of the development of legal services and criminal defence services. That is consistent with our ongoing commitment to engage all interested parties to ensure that the reforms deliver the objectives that we have set out. Getting the process right and delivering these reforms will be of great benefit to the citizens of Northern Ireland, to taxpayers and to society. I commend the order to the Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor), I advise hon. Members of two things. First, there is no injury time, so we shall still finish at 4.30 pm. Secondly, there must be nine members of the Committee before me, not including the Minister or the Whip. We are extremely close to the quorum at the moment.</span></p>
<p>3.26 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr. McWilliam, and welcome you to the Chair. You have occupied that Chair on many occasions with your usual authority and pleasant good order. I believe that the Minister is a debutant before this Committee, and I therefore welcome her, too.<br><br>
I am aware of your advice about time, Mr. McWilliam. As I look at the Clock, it occurs to me that there is scarcely more than an hour to go. I do not want to trespass on eternity; my views and those of my party are, in my estimation, of less value to the Committee and the Minister than those of the people who live in the Province or represent it—or do both, as is the case for four hon. Members present. In some senses, I defer to those hon. Members' views. They, their constituents and the professionals in their community have to operate the systems that we are discussing, so we should pay good attention to what such hon. Members say.<br><br>
As I said earlier, I do not speak for the Law Society of Northern Ireland. I could not presume to do so; I am not a member of it. However, the members of that professional body practise the system day in, day out, in offices, law courts and—from time to time—penal establishments. I trust, in the name of fair play, that the views of the Law Society of Northern Ireland, for which I carry no brief, will be weighed and given the value that is their due. Its members are daily practitioners of the regime that the Lord Chancellor's Department is extending to Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I should perhaps declare what may be an interest. It probably is not, but it is better said than left unsaid. I was a practising solicitor. I am now non-practising; I went straight about 14 years ago, and have not touched the law since. There is quite a good chance
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
of my making a total recovery. That brings to mind an early experience of mine as a solicitor.<br><br>
It may surprise the Committee to know that at the age of 26 I was selected to play golf for the English solicitors against the Northern Ireland solicitors' golf team. That match was an away fixture, so we flew over and met our charming hosts. During a meet-and-greet and get-to-know-you session, with a little something in our hand at the time, I was asked by one of our hosts what my golf club was at home. I said that I was a member of the North Warwickshire golf club, whereupon my host said to me, "And is that a Protestant or a Catholic club?" In my mid-twenties I gained an insight into the sort of question that would never have occurred to me. In fact, I was temporarily overwhelmed by that question, because I was, somewhat precociously, a member of the committee of my golf club and had to confess that I did not know the faith, or the non-faith, of any other member. That matter would not have occurred to me—it did not seem to be relevant.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>David Burnside</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In the same sense of politeness, I am not a golfer, but I live very close to Royal Portrush golf club, which is one of the great golf links in the world—no offence to Royal County Down golf club. Members of golf clubs in Northern Ireland do not ask people their religion. Frankly, I find the hon. Gentleman's remarks offensive.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am very sorry. I did not mean to cause offence. I was relating a true occurrence that happened to me to explain how, as a much younger man, about 35 years ago, I gained an insight into a community, which I had not understood previously. I had not considered that such a question mattered. No offence was intended. That was a true case that I have remembered across the years, which made me realise that that community was different, although it was part of my own country.<br><br>
Perhaps I should acknowledge to the hon. Gentleman, since he raised the point, that I have played at Royal Portrush twice: the first time on the occasion that I mentioned and the other time last year. He may take the intelligence back to the Province that Royal Portrush was far too tough for me. It is one of the most majestic golf courses that I have ever seen. I really ought to play the course off the ladies' tees to have any chance at all.<br><br>
I think that you would like me to get back to the subject, Mr. McWilliam. I shall not detain the Committee, because I am conscious of the fact that time is passing. The Opposition welcome the establishment of the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission, which is an independent, non-departmental public body. The intention behind such a body is to encourage both transparency and flexibility.<br><br>
Rather disturbingly, it has been reported in the <i>Daily Mail</i> that one of the suspects of the Omagh bombing, Michael McKevitt, has been granted legal aid to fight the landmark legal case that has been brought by families of the victims. Michael McKevitt's bill for contesting the families' bid to sue the suspects could, eventually, be as high as £500,000, while the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0606">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
families have sought legal aid unsuccessfully. The Lord Chancellor has decreed that the order will not result in any new, additional burden on existing levels of public funding. In light of recent events, however, we must ensure that legal funding is distributed fairly and justly.<br><br>
Additionally, the trial of the three alleged IRA men who have been charged with training guerrillas in the use of explosives in Colombia is imminent, although it has been postponed because they are refusing to leave their cells. Can the Minister provide clarification on the agreements that have been reached between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Colombia on the costs of bringing them to trial?<br><br>
I will detain the Committee no longer, but I wish to say again to the hon. Member for South Antrim (David Burnside) that I did not mean to cause any offence; I was merely recounting what was a salutary experience for me when I was a younger man.<br><br>
I know that you, Mr. McWilliam, are in a little difficulty with regard to the quorum. Indeed, that is a problem for all of us. I was going to say that no discourtesy would be intended to you or the Minister if I were to leave the Committee before 4.30 pm, but I am resolved not to be the hon. Member who collapses the quorum. However, if we should become more plentiful, I may not stay until that time.</span></p>
<p>3.35 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair once again, Mr. McWilliam, but I am sure that you will not mind if I say that the Minister's presence is an even more attractive sight for all of us: she is very welcome to this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. There is no contest.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I assure the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) that the strength and success of our golf clubs and other sporting institutions in Northern Ireland derives very much from the fact that they are non-discriminatory, and I am pleased that his most recent visit was much more satisfactory than his initial one.<br><br>
The Ulster Unionist party welcomes the principle of legal aid reform in Northern Ireland, and I was part of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee that looked at legal aid reform in May 2001. However, this order is largely skeletal; it is clear that the bones of the new Legal Services Commission are without flesh. We are given very little to go on—for example, with regard to how the commission will be set up or what the running costs will be. How can we be sure that the commission will not become yet another elaborate and expensive bureaucracy? The absence of detail—and, indeed, of any time frame for implementation—must be addressed.<br><br>
Throughout the order, the Lord Chancellor is empowered to give directions and guidance to the commission. I draw attention to article 47, which outlines the Lord Chancellor's role in making remuneration orders. If the order is intended to provide an independent framework for the provision and administration of legal services by setting up a new non-departmental Legal Services Commission, do
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
not the extensive powers given to the Lord Chancellor undermine that independence? The Legal Services Commission will become more administrative than executive; in devolution terms, it will be more of a Welsh Assembly than a Scottish Parliament.<br><br>
The Lord Chancellor has the power to appoint members to the commission. In the light of recent events at the Northern Ireland Office, eligibility of employment within the new Legal Services Commission is an issue that is worth highlighting. Therefore, I seek an assurance that stringent security checks will be put in place to ensure that undesirables do not find themselves at the heart of the commission; that point has already been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim. Public confidence in the commission must be established from the outset.<br><br>
I also draw attention to the prioritisation of services. The order does not outline how cases are to be prioritised. What criteria will be in place for prioritisation? What conditions will dictate whether one case deserves greater priority than another? That is particularly relevant in civil legal services because the fund will be capped. Could needy individuals lose out because of the ever-escalating cost of other cases such as the Bloody Sunday tribunal? The cost of that, incidentally, is thought to be £100 million, and it is rising rapidly.<br><br>
I welcome the replacement of the merits test with something more flexible. However, problems are related to articles 18 and 19, which deal with costs for assisted and unassisted parties. If a claimant received legal aid but a defendant did not and the unassisted defendant won the case, he or she would still have to pay his or her costs. Such costs are sometimes in excess of what it would have cost to settle the case, but the defendant clearly has the right to retain an unblemished reputation. Why should I settle a claim for £1,000 to a legally assisted claimant if I am in the right, although it costs me £1,200 to defend myself? That is a clear injustice and the opportunity to resolve it through a new order has not been taken. No doubt the Minister will also consider the example to which my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South referred.<br><br>
I shall consider criminal defence services. It is accepted that criminal legal aid, subject to criminal proceedings, should be available for virtually all cases, save minor traffic offences or other such cases. That is due to the serious nature and potential consequences of the proceedings. However, the problem with criminal legal aid is that profit margins are small. Solicitors aim either to do the perfect job and consequently attract high-paying clients, who are few and far between in Northern Ireland, or to process as many cases as possible with minimum administration. Does that really secure value for money from quality legal services? Does that ensure that the most appropriate and cost-effective services are available to the public?<br><br>
The order provides the ability to contract specialised agencies and professional individuals to deliver legal services. That goes some way toward addressing the imbalance in providing quality legal services for all. However, in practice, it seems that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0607">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
those agencies or individuals will lose out. In England and Wales, the agents are usually very junior barristers or pupil barristers. They do all the work. They consider the papers, advise on the plea, make representations on bail and mitigate for a sentence. Sometimes all that is done for a fee from the solicitor that is as low as £40 before tax. On the other hand, the solicitor, who has done little or no work, can pocket over 50 per cent, of the fee paid by the Legal Services Commission. If those agencies and individuals are used, efforts must be made to ensure that the people who do the work get a fair proportion of the fee or that they are paid directly by the Legal Services Commission.<br><br>
I have specific worries about provisions under part III of the draft order, which are known as the alternative funding options. Part III is identical to existing legislation in England and Wales. The Law Society of Northern Ireland has stated that the provisions are entirely unsuitable for the Province. Indeed, it appears that they have caused great difficulties in the English litigation service. The Law Society said that they have led to the
<br><blockquote><p>"unregulated operation of claims-management companies, such as Claims Direct; the exploitation of individual litigants; the domination of the market by the same insurers who operate the defence side of litigation; and the effective denial of choice of solicitor."</p></blockquote>
Do we wish to bring in legislation that would cause the same things to happen in Northern Ireland?<br><br>
Furthermore, the no-win, no-fee arrangements must have a capped percentage to prevent solicitors from benefiting financially by an amount in excess of what might be deemed reasonable. In any case, persons with valid but low claims will not have access to legal services. A solicitor will not touch a £1,000 claim unless he expects at least half of that in return. If legal aid is to be targeted at those in greatest need, it must be provided for low-value claims that are high enough to be significant to the claimant but not necessarily to the solicitor.<br><br>
The Law Society put forward an alternative proposal: a contingency legal aid fund to be financed from the public purse but independently run on a not-for-profit basis. That is a most worthy suggestion and I would be grateful for the Minister's views on it. I am also concerned about the mention of graduated fees. Those have failed miserably in England. Family cases in particular have driven experienced practitioners out of the publicly funded market. I read in <i>The Times</i> this Tuesday an article headed,
<br><blockquote><p>"Legal aid lawyers abandon divorce cases as fees drop".</p></blockquote>
A survey of more than 1,600 barristers conducted by the Family Law Bar Association found that 42 per cent, had refused to take on divorce-related financial settlements. <i>The Times</i> gave an example of a woman from Loughton who contacted 20 solicitors before finally finding someone to take on her case.<br><br>
According to the Northern Ireland Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, in Northern Ireland—in the Province—we already have in the region of 200,000
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
unmet cases. Do we wish to see that figure increase through so-called improvements to the current system?<br><br>
In conclusion, I draw attention to the skeletal nature of the order, to the extensive powers it gives to the Lord Chancellor, which clearly undermine the independence of the new commission, to the issue of prioritisation and to the issues surrounding the alternative funding options. I welcome the opportunity that I have had this afternoon to raise those matters, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on those and other matters in her reply.</span></p>
<p>3.47 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Patsy Calton <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I also welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam.<br><br>
I should like to raise several matters that have been brought to my attention, largely by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Some have already been explored by other hon. Members, but I should like to ask the Minister whether certain issues have been answered or remain outstanding.<br><br>
The Human Rights Commission is concerned that the order will not increase access to justice in Northern Ireland, although, with a number of other bodies, it welcomes the provision of the LSC—the Legal Services Commission. I have a real problem with "LSC" because it also means "Learning and Skills Council", so every time I say it I have to ask myself which one I am discussing.<br><br>
The point has been made that the order does not necessarily meet the particular legal aid agenda in Northern Ireland and the proposals are possibly motivated by a need to reduce legal aid expenditure. The Minister referred to that, and I understand her situation: her Department is faced with a budget that has risen from £12.19 million to £41.53 million in a relatively short period. I also understand that diverting funds to other areas, such as housing and welfare advice, is necessary. However, although taking control of cost is obviously important, problems may build up because of other issues, to which I shall return. I agree that it is not possible to have a completely demand-led system. However, a balance needs to be struck in meeting need, not ignoring it, because legal aid services currently do not and cannot reach parts of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The lack of detail in the legislation has caused concern, although I heard the Minister's response and sympathise with her point of view. If the legislation were too detailed it would clearly be difficult to amend. I understand that the point of pre-legislative scrutiny is to try to come up with detailed information, but there is an issue about key points being left to future secondary legislation or the discretion of the commission and/or the Lord Chancellor. That area needs to be addressed before final drafting.<br><br>
The Human Rights Commission asks for the protection of human rights to be listed in the LSC's competences, and I should be interested to know whether that matter has been addressed since it made its submission. It argues, as have the Liberal Democrats on a number of occasions, that
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0608">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
"representative of the Community" should extend to gender, racial and social representation in addition to religious and political representation. There has been a great deal of argument in another place about whether it would be better to replace
<br><blockquote><p>"representative of the Community in Northern Ireland"</p></blockquote>
with "reflective of the Community in Northern Ireland", and I would support such a change in the commission's composition.<br><br>
What plans does the Minister have to address the issue raised by the Human Rights Commission of whether a duty should be imposed on the LSC to consult widely on the extent of unmet legal need?<br><br>
Does the Minister intend to address the issue, which has been raised by several hon. Members, about the Lord Chancellor being able to influence, and possibly dictate to, the LSC? As other hon. Members have said, that would seriously undermine its independence. The Human Rights Commission made it clear that the Lord Chancellor should be a statutory consultee rather than an influencing factor.<br><br>
Legal fees have been mentioned, and the LSC should be able to keep them at a reasonable level that is not so low as to be unattractive to legal practitioners. I should be interested to know whether the Minister has picked up on that point.<br><br>
Concerns have been expressed about exclusions from civil legal services. Has the Minister addressed the question of whether the blanket exclusion of legal aid from certain categories will impinge on the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European convention on human rights? Electoral rights may be excluded from the range of civil legal services, and the Human Rights Commission makes the point that
<br><blockquote><p>"Electoral rights are too important to be ineligible for such assistance".</p></blockquote>
Concerns have also been expressed that investigation after a death must allow the family to have effective access to the investigatory process. The next of kin must be involved in the procedure to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interest. The Human Rights Commission is unsure whether the measures will guarantee that.<br><br>
Under recent reforms in Scotland, civil legal aid can be made available prior to industrial tribunals. Concern has been expressed about the lack of legal aid available before immigration appeals tribunals; I understand that such aid is available in England and Wales.<br><br>
On financial eligibility, only the very poorest qualify for legal aid. Persons on low income do so if they make a financial contribution, but that often constitutes a disproportionate amount of their income, so many people cannot afford legal advice. The lower capital limit for financial eligibility should be upgraded in line with inflation for every year since 1983.<br><br>
The Human Rights Commission is not in favour of the LSC's contracting-out provision for legal services. On the funding code, it believes that fixed budgets would contravene the European convention on human rights. Does the Minister share that view? I agree with the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) about
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
the possible consequences of failing to allow for flexibility to fund a case where the applicant requires the grant of funding.<br><br>
The Human Rights Commission would be concerned if the Lord Chancellor's Department influenced priorities for funding, because the Government may be a defendant in many cases. If the Lord Chancellor could influence the LSC to do as he wished, reassurance that the power would not apply to the LSC's priorities would be required.<br><br>
Other hon. Members mentioned criteria for the availability of funding for services to the individual which is not provided by the LSC. The problem is that if other organisations are expected to contribute, individuals may be excluded merely because of the slight possibility that another organisation such as the Human Rights Commission would be able to provide funding, when really it could not because it has very little funding itself.<br><br>
I welcome the Minister's determination to make firms, bodies and individuals register for compliance with the code of practice. That should be required not only of directly paid bodies, but of those that offer services on a no win, no fee basis. It would be a great pity if people were turned away, forced to go elsewhere and then failed to secure the level of service that would have been provided by direct funding.<br><br>
Most of my remaining points have been made by hon. Members with much more legal training and knowledge. As you know, Mr. McWilliam, I found out that I was to attend the Committee about 24 hours ago, and since then I have been working solidly on a number of other issues. If I have made any sense at all, it is entirely due to a young man who has been acting for me as a researcher in the past week—a student from Manchester grammar school who has been with me on work experience. For the record, his name is Paul Stuart and I believe that he is likely to go very far indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Mr. Stuart is to be congratulated, as is the hon. Lady. Most people do not recognise the authorship of their brief.</span></p>
<p>4 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Dodds</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious that we are hanging on to the quorum by a thread. A lot of the issues have been dealt with, so I shall be as brief as possible. I also declare my interest—I am a non-practising member of the Northern Ireland Bar. Since I gave up the Bar, I have had less time to play golf. That has been a recurring theme in the debate.<br><br>
Reform of the legal aid system is an area of particular concern for people in Northern Ireland. On behalf of my party, I welcome that reform, but I stress that there are concerns about aspects of the proposed order. As well as the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Lord Chancellor's Legal Aid Advisory Committee in Northern Ireland has said that the proposals
<br><blockquote><p>"do not meet the needs of the legal aid agenda in Northern Ireland."</p></blockquote>
The main objective of the order is increasing access to justice, so we have to be concerned that many people and organisations in Northern Ireland, not just those
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0609">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
with a vested interest—including the Northern Ireland Assembly, which considered the matter in great detail—have expressed concerns about whether it will meet that objective. The Assembly concluded that it would not. Many hon. Members argue that we should take account of politicians in Northern Ireland, particularly when the communities reach a consensus, as the Assembly did on this issue. That point of view should be carefully weighed in the balance.<br><br>
Some people believe that the changes are primarily about reducing expenditure. There is a lack of detail. The figures that the Minister outlined show considerable increases in annual expenditure during the past decade. We recognise that, and it is clearly an issue for Government. However, it has been said to me on more than one occasion that there does not seem to be the same concern about the extraordinary amounts—tens of millions of pounds—of public money that have been spent on the Bloody Sunday inquiry. It is estimated that the inquiry could cost upwards of £150 million before it concludes. It puts matters into perspective to compare the sums of money spent on that tribunal inquiry to the legal aid bill.<br><br>
Several hon. Members have referred to concerns about lack of detail. It has been difficult for consultees to give a detailed response to the proposed order without knowing the detail. I accept what the Minister said about wanting to involve the Legal Services Commission and hear its views, but it is difficult for us to address the issues when we do not have the detail that we need. It is important that legal aid be administered by an independent body, not the Law Society. As I mentioned to the Minister, there are concerns about the costs of creating another quango at a time when public administration is being reviewed in Northern Ireland. That is clearly an issue.<br><br>
We have not had much detail on the prioritisation of cases. That is something that has been raised by several consultees. It is important to know what sort of criteria will be applied in prioritising cases for civil legal aid. I endorse the remarks made by the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mrs. Calton) on the possible extension of legal aid to tribunal representation. The Human Rights Commission found that an appellant's chances of success before a tribunal increased from one in four without independent representation to one in two with it. Advances have been made in Scotland so we should consider the situation in Northern Ireland. I, too, am concerned about the exclusion of categories of cases, such as election petitions. That is a very serious matter.<br><br>
I am pleased that the new fund for criminal legal aid will not be capped. However, in my view, draft paragraph 30 restricts access to justice, in that the commission can determine the number and description of legal representatives. Lawyers and others in Northern Ireland have expressed the view that the level of representation should be determined by the court, not by a commission. I would be grateful for the Minister's views on that. I welcome the fact that the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
commission has been given the task of preparing a criminal defence service code of conduct.<br><br>
I am conscious of the time, but I wish to reiterate my concern about the introduction of a statutory basis for conditional fee agreements, to which several Members have referred. In reply to my intervention, the Minister talked about freed up money. Money not spent on damage claims makes it possible to focus public funds on other priority needs in England and Wales. The Lord Chancellor's Legal Aid Advisory Committee does not agree:
<br><blockquote><p>"Since most personal injury cases result in a settlement or a victory in court, with the defendant's insurer paying the costs, there can have been so very little money re-focused in this way that the claim made for CFAs in paragraph 152 cannot be accepted."</p></blockquote>
I would be grateful if the Minister would address that point. Her contention is that such agreements should be supported because money can be refocused and redistributed. That view is certainly not shared or supported by the Lord Chancellor's Legal Aid Advisory Committee. In fact, it comes down very strongly against that argument and says that there is no substance in it. It actually goes so far as to describe it as a "demonstrable falsehood."<br><br>
Reform is welcome. In many ways, it is overdue. However, there are serious issues that must be considered. I appeal to the Minister to take account of the comments made by the Northern Ireland Assembly. Its Members looked at the proposals in great detail. As representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, they did so through an ad hoc committee. She should also take account of the views that have been expressed by many hon. Members today.</span></p>
<p>4.8 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The debate has been extremely useful. I welcome hon. Members' general support for the establishment of a Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission. The debate today is very much part of the consultative process; obviously, I shall take back many points. As hon. Members are aware, we are still consulting on certain issues.<br><br>
Let me begin by making particular reference to the points that several hon. Members made about the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, some of which were quite detailed. The Government have welcomed the interest taken in the proposals by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which plays an important role in advising the Government on human rights issues, policies and legislative proposals. It has raised issues, some of which can be responded to simply with further detail. We shall take some of its points into account, but we may differ on others. Given the time remaining, the best way for me to respond to the detailed points made by hon. Members is to write to the commission, and I shall be more than happy to circulate that response to Committee members.<br><br>
Many hon. Members have raised the general issue of the Lord Chancellor's powers under the proposals. It is important to recognise that we are trying to establish a commission that can reflect the local need for legal services in Northern Ireland and target and
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0610">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
prioritise. However, that must be done within a framework set by the Government of the day. It is therefore right that the commission should be accountable to Parliament through the Lord Chancellor. That is an important principle, which should reassure hon. Members that the body will not be operating outwith the democratic process. It is important to stress that we want to achieve a balance between independence and accountability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mrs. Calton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the Minister to reflect on the possibility that the Lord Chancellor will be involved in deciding on cases in which the Government are the defendants? Would such a case cause the Lord Chancellor to take a particular view, or is there some way round such special cases?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The commission, not the Lord Chancellor, would decide individual cases. The hon. Lady is searching for a guarantee that the commission would decide on individual cases, irrespective of whether a Government Department was being challenged, which is often the case.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Would it be appropriate to say that the Lord Chancellor would not in any sense intrude into a decision, but would remain accountable for the expenditure, not least to the Comptroller and Auditor General?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Winterton</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Exactly. The point that I was making was that if an individual were involved in a case in England and Wales against, say, a public body, which one could argue has connections with the Government, that case would not be referred to the Lord Chancellor.<br><br>
Perhaps I can reassure the hon. Members for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds) and for East Antrim. It is true that the Lord Chancellor sets the priority types of cases under the funding code. I gave the examples of civil proceedings involving a real or immediate risk of loss of life or liberty, social welfare issues or domestic violence. That said, the priorities set for Northern Ireland will reflect local needs and the code will be consulted on. It will be subject to an equality impact assessment and will be human rights compatible. The code will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny under the affirmative resolution procedure, so Parliament will be able to consider the priorities that have been set and comment on them. That is a safeguard that I think hon. Members want.<br><br>
I think that the hon. Member for East Antrim described the order as skeletal. The way in which the system is being set up in Northern Ireland is no different from the way in which it was set up in England and Wales. Indeed, in establishing the Legal Services Commission in Northern Ireland we are in a privileged position because we can learn a lot from the experiences in England and Wales. Rather than concentrating on dotting all the i's and crossing the t's, we want to ensure that the commission operates in
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
a way that takes into account local needs and reflects local priorities. We want to have a long consultation period about how that is to be achieved involving not only the professions but local organisations and local voluntary and consumer bodies, so that the commission will truly reflect local needs.<br><br>
I return to the point made by the hon. Member for Belfast, North. When we talk about the increase in costs since 1991, we should bear in mind the startling fact that the number of people who have benefited from legal aid has not increased by many. That is a key difficulty and a big problem: we have not been able to assist the number of people that one would imagine in view of the increase in costs. The system that we propose will allow for extension—it will enable more people to gain greater access to justice, and I take issue with the Human Rights Commission on that.<br><br>
With regard to the power of the Lord Chancellor to give guidance, given the comments that have been made in today's debate, I wish to place it on the record that paragraph 8(3) of the draft order expressly prohibits the Lord Chancellor from giving guidance to the commission on individual cases.<br><br>
Finally, on the issue of a contingency legal aid fund versus conditional fee agreements, as I said, we take the views of the Lord Chancellor's advisory committee very seriously. We have commissioned further work on the viability of a privately funded CLAF and will take all relevant matters into consideration.<br><br>
Today's debate has shown that it is generally accepted that it is important that we reform the legal aid system in Northern Ireland. We accept that we must do everything to ensure that the maximum number of citizens benefit from the money spent. As elected representatives, it is important that we do everything that we can to ensure that public money is spent for the greater benefit of citizens.<br><br>
I am very grateful for all the contributions made by hon. Members this afternoon. As I said, this debate is part of the consultative process and all the views expressed today will be fed back into it. I hope that we can get the process right and introduce a system that provides high-quality services to a greater number of people in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
