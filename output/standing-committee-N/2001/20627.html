	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Desmond Browne)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the scope for a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland.</p></q>
I welcome you, Mr. McWilliam, to the Chair. This is the second meeting of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee during this Session and, if I remember correctly, you were in the Chair when we last met, so you are aware of the quality of debate that we can expect this afternoon. I am sure that we shall all behave in such a way that you will not be exercised in keeping us in order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Calls for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland have been made for a number of years, but the current debate has its genesis in the Belfast agreement. Under the agreement, the new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was invited to consult and advise on the scope for defining additional rights—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On human rights, as it is warm this afternoon, hon. Gentlemen may remove their jackets if they wish.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam. I am sure that the Committee is pleased to have been given some direction on the scope for cooling down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the Belfast agreement, the new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was invited to consult and advise on the scope for defining additional rights reflecting the "particular circumstances" of Northern Ireland, which, with the European convention on human rights, could form a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. Since then, the commission has carried out a long consultation process with a wide variety of interested groups and that process continues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister giving way so early in what I am sure will be a penetrating insight into the birth of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. He referred to the agreement and the mandate given to the commission and used the words "to consult and advise on the scope for defining" these rights. Does that include drafting a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Lady's question because that is part of the debate that has
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
been engendered by the draft Bill which the commission published on 4 September 2001 for consultation. There was a formal consultation period of around three months until December 2001, but the consultation continues, as the commission made clear. There was some challenge about that, but my view is practical. It would have been strange for the commission, following extensive consultation, to say just yes or no or that there is scope for a Bill of Rights without giving an indication now of what might be in the Bill. As the Minister with responsibility for human rights, I believe that it has been helpful to the debate to have a practical example of a Bill of Rights against which to engage in debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make limited observations about the process because of my particular position in relation to the discussion and consultation. I shall explain that to the Committee in a few minutes. It is helpful to me and to the debate to have a draft against which to test some of the principles that should be considered. I hope that my response is helpful to the hon. Lady.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To put it bluntly, one cannot advise on the scope for a Bill of Rights without considering what the Bill would contain, particularly if it is to reflect the circumstances in Northern Ireland and merge with and generate rights that are additional to those set out in the convention. That is my response but, of course, it is not the end of the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many people, perhaps the majority, in Northern Ireland will question why we are not dealing with a Bill of Rights for the whole of the United Kingdom. Why are we limiting it to Northern Ireland? Some of the questions asked by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which is oriented towards a final unification of Ireland, have set alarm bells ringing in Northern Ireland. I would have thought that we would begin with a Bill of Rights for the people of Northern Ireland as they are now and not try to project ourselves into the future, when the situation might be different—indeed, a situation not envisaged in the sort of questions that are being asked.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman's point is helpful in that it feeds into the debate. Such issues must be debated in the context of the scope for a Bill of Rights that reflects the circumstances of Northern Ireland. The question is germane. It is not like the hon. Gentleman to anticipate a future position but, in a sense, his question does that. We are at present not making a decision about a Bill of Rights for anywhere but Northern Ireland. We are in the process of carrying out a consultation led by the commission. With its genesis in the Belfast agreement, the mandate comes from the political parties in Northern Ireland and the two Governments, as reflected in the referendums that took place in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The background of the mandate does not allow the commission to change its instructions to consider the scope for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, and the commission is following its instructions precisely by consulting and formulating advice to the Secretary of State on the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0582">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
We are at present debating not a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland—that is a misunderstanding—but the scope for one. It may be that the debate has become confused because the commission felt it appropriate, in order to encourage debate, to formulate what a Bill of Rights might include. I believe that that was right. However, I do not think that we should jump from the scope for such a Bill to what should be included in it. We must consider the scope, and my remarks will concentrate on that in the hope of generating a debate that is germane to the issues of today, not tomorrow.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the scope does not consider the victims of the past. Let me clarify that: if someone was the victim of torture or some other human rights abuse that was against the law at the time, they should have redress under the Bill.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is encouraging me to do what I avowed I would not do. I shall not debate individual rights, because my position as a Minister—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The scope.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me answer the question in the way that I wish. If the hon. Gentleman is dissatisfied, he can intervene again. The Secretary of State and I, as a Minister in the Northern Ireland Office, await the eventual advice on the scope for a Bill of Rights. Therefore, it would be inappropriate for me as the Minister with responsibility for human rights to say on my behalf, or on that of the Secretary of State, what I think of individual rights. If the hon. Gentleman wishes to feed into the debate his argument about the scope for rights relating to victims, he is entitled to do so and should do so. I hope that he will be able to catch your eye, Mr. McWilliam, and contribute to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A careful reading of the draft Bill will reveal that it contains draft rights relating to past victims. As I understand it, it contains a specific reference to that, so I am not certain that the draft produced by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has the lacunae that the hon. Gentleman suggests are in it from his reading. However, if he wants to fill such a space in the draft Bill in a particular way, I am sure that the commission will be very keen to hear from him. No doubt, he will bring to that debate, as he does to all debates on Northern Ireland, his very particular view based on his extensive experience of service there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process of consultation continues. I support the commission's view that it should seek the views of as many people as possible before coming to any final conclusions. If that process takes longer than was originally envisaged—it looks as if it will—so be it. The crucial thing is for people from all sections of the community to have the opportunity to contribute to that process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that there is a large swathe of the public in Northern Ireland, especially among the Unionist community, that has great difficulty in making submissions to the commission, given that one of its first actions was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
the endorsement of religious discrimination in the recruitment of new police officers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am encouraged by the increasing ability of people from different sections of the community in Northern Ireland to engage in this debate. I was looking yesterday at a list that I have been keeping of those who have gone public on the matter and, to my delight, I was able to reflect that an article in a newsletter on the subject contained a quotation from a member of the hon. Lady's party. Not only did that gentleman make a very positive and encouraging contribution to the debate, but he prayed in aid the fact that the hon. Lady was also engaged in the debate. The hon. Lady is an example to all the people of Northern Ireland, showing them that they should engage in this debate and that there is nothing to fear from doing so. No community in Northern Ireland has anything to fear from engaging in a debate on human rights. They are for everybody. I am sure that that is the message that the hon. Lady wants me to give the people of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's response, but it was to a question that I did not actually ask, and was a commentary on a recent meeting of party members. Can he answer the following question: does he accept that there is a broad swathe of people, especially in the Unionist community, that has great difficulty in dealing with a human rights commission that endorsed religious discrimination in the recruitment of police officers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady can perhaps speak for sections of the Northern Ireland community better than I can. If she wishes to feed into the Committee's record the fact that that is a perception of a section of the community in Northern Ireland, she has succeeded in doing so in her two interventions. I was seeking to answer the point that that is the perception that some people in Northern Ireland have with my view of a changing perception, through engagement, that people in Northern Ireland have. I say quite strongly, and I am sure that the hon. Lady would join with me in saying this, that it is important that all sections of the community in Northern Ireland engage in the debate on the scope for a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland. No one in Northern Ireland has anything to fear from human rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fact of the matter is that the vehicle whereby the advice will come to the Secretary of State is the body that the people of Northern Ireland agreed to endorse: the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. They should engage with that body, and they have nothing to fear by expressing to the commission their views as strongly as they wish because everyone has everything to gain from human rights, and nothing to lose from developed human rights in Northern Ireland. That is the answer that I give to the hon. Lady. I cannot speak for other people's views based on their perception of historical issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

have now been on my feet for about 15 minutes and managed one page of my speech. I want to make some progress. The hon. Gentleman should just hold the point that he wants to make for now. I want to develop the theme of my speech, and he may then receive his answer. If he does not, I promise that I will let him intervene later on. Lots of people want to speak, and increasingly, because I accept too many interventions, there is too little time for others to contribute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government cannot and will not seek to influence the proposals put forward by the commission. Our position is, and always has been, that we will await final advice before coming to any policy decisions. The Government have an active interest in the debate. I have a duty to highlight a few issues of principle that need to be fully explored and debated as the commission firms up its advice. I wrote to the commission raising those points in November 2001 and I should like to take the Committee through them now. They are, first, the role of a Bill of Rights in achieving reconciliation and rapprochement; secondly, the relationship of a Bill of Rights with the European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998; thirdly, what we mean by the "particular circumstances" of Northern Ireland; fourthly, where the balance lies between good policy and justiciable rights; and fifthly, enforcement mechanisms, which will probably be the least engaging of the five.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the first point of reconciliation and rapprochement, the agreement that formed the basis for the formation of the commission and the current debate on a Bill of Rights stated that the two Governments and the parties would
	<br><q><p>"strive in every practical way towards reconciliation and rapprochement within the framework of democratic and agreed arrangements."</p></q>
It follows, therefore, that any Bill of Rights that would have the effect of polarising opinion would not contribute towards that goal. The importance of achieving the maximum possible level of consensus from across the community is, in my view, self-evident. That is why I am pleased to see such a diverse range of people engaging with the commission in this process. All of us as politicians have a duty to encourage people to get involved in the debate to ensure that the final product helps facilitate the process of reconciliation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Burnside</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This will be my only intervention during the debate and it is fundamentally important. The Minister will remember section 19 of the Belfast agreement, which covered the subject of policing. That section referred to the independent commission on policing seeking to gain widespread community support, not support to communities. That was one of the reasons why some of us gave some sympathy to that objective in the reform of policing. Will the Minister give a commitment to the Committee that in the debate on human rights, the Government will retain the objective as stated in section 19 of the agreement to command widespread community support? The evidence in practice on policing has proved that there was not widespread community
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
support for the legislation on the future of policing in Northern Ireland that was pushed through this House by an elected majority. Will he give a commitment that the mistakes linked to Patten will not be made on human rights, and that he will seek widespread community support? I define community as being the whole of Northern Ireland as a corporate and electoral block.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief. That one was a wee bit long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No matter what my answer would be to the assertions of the hon. Gentleman in relation to policing, which I do not accept, I would seek to define widespread community support. A clever political answer to the hon. Gentleman's assertion about policing would be, first, to define those three terms and then to give the Government's answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not accept that policing in Northern Ireland, even in its reformed fashion, does not command widespread community support. Polls suggest that more than 80 per cent, of the population of Northern Ireland supports the police in their present form. I do not know how widespread, how much community or how much support the hon. Gentleman needs, but there is not a politician in this Room who would not be delighted with that level of support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To answer the hon. Gentleman's question in relation to this debate and this process, I am sure that he paid attention to the last five or six sentences that I spoke before his intervention. I do not think that I could have made it clearer, in the context of this debate, that I am calling for the most widespread debate. I am saying, as a point of principle, that given the objectives of the Belfast agreement, which is the genesis of this whole process in terms of reconciliation and rapprochement, I would expect us to encourage, and the commission to be receptive to, a process that achieves the maximum possible consensus. Where I am coming from at the moment, the maximum possible consensus and widespread community support seem pretty near. If that satisfies the hon. Gentleman, then we are thinking the same things about where this process should end up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the context of the European convention on human rights. The Belfast agreement was not clear about whether there was a need for additional rights. However, it was clear that there was a need for the incorporation of the ECHR and for serious work to be undertaken to determine whether other things, reflecting Northern Ireland's "particular circumstances", should sit alongside the convention in a Bill of Rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European convention on human rights, of course, has been a reality for the United Kingdom for a number of decades. Since 1966, any individual who feels that his or her rights have been violated has been able to take a case to the Strasbourg court. The UK accepted the right of individual application in 1966. Since 2000, when the Human Rights Act came fully into force in Northern Ireland, individuals have been able to rely on the rights guaranteed by the convention directly in the domestic courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
That legislation applies across the whole of the UK, providing a uniform framework of rights, safeguards and enforcement mechanisms. That plays into the point made by the hon. Member for South Antrim (David Burnside), which is part of the debate on this issue. That is the framework into which any Bill of Rights must be slotted, and it is important that the associated enforcement mechanisms put in place are compatible with the arrangements under the Human Rights Act. I will discuss that in a little more detail in due course.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the commission's remit in considering the scope for a Bill of Rights is to reflect the "particular circumstances" of Northern Ireland, it is imperative that we have a discussion about what those "particular circumstances" are and what is meant by that section of the Belfast agreement. Opinions range right across the spectrum. Some would say that there is no fundamental difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK—or, for that matter, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Some would say that the troubles have affected all aspects of society, from the court system through to, for example, children's health.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Different interpretations of the "particular circumstances" fundamentally affect the understanding of what should be included in the Bill. For example, if someone believes that the children of Northern Ireland have all been seriously and adversely affected by the troubles, the chances are that they will believe that the Bill should make special provision for children. But then, why should a child from Newtownards enjoy rights that are not granted to a child from Newcastle—the Newcastle in the north-east of England? Similarly, people who are rightly concerned about levels of poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland argue that there should be strong protection for social and economic rights in any Bill of Rights, but are the people of the Bogside really entitled to greater rights than the people of Brixton?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution provides for different administrations across the UK to adopt different policies, responding as they see fit to the circumstances of their area. I support that. As a firm believer in devolution, I am committed to the principle that decisions affecting local people are best made by locally elected politicians. Of course, that will lead to differences, but they are differences in policy, not differences in fundamental rights. For me, that distinction is at the heart of the debate on what might—or might not—be part of any Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a myth that often surfaces in human rights debates that because all rights are good things, all good things are rights. That cannot be the case. Lots of things are good—many are very good—and we all want them and enjoy them. For that reason, elected politicians may seek to pursue issues and develop policies that ensure that people can enjoy the good things they seek. However, that does not make those things rights. It just makes them good policies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that much careful thought needs to be given to that issue in the context of proposals for a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. We need to be very
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
clear that we are proposing rights rather than good policies. I spoke earlier about my commitment to devolution, and I am committed to the principle that decisions that affect local people are best made by local politicians. In Northern Ireland, that issue is of particular importance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
After 30 years of direct rule, we now have a situation where locally elected politicians are substantially running the country, taking important decisions that affect the life of the people there. Not only that, but the new institutions are based on a system of power sharing involving politicians from both sides of the community. Moreover, contrary to many people's expectations, this is working. That is something of which politicians here and in the Assembly can be proud, and it is something we should all strive to protect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That makes it all the more important that, in framing any Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, we are very clear about where the balance lies between rights and policies. We should not use rights to undermine the democratic process. We must make a distinction between what should be the preserve of the courts and what rightly lies with the politicians. In the context of Northern Ireland, that means a balance between issues that should be dealt with by Westminster—as the Bill of Rights would be—and what should sit with the Assembly at Stormont. Having only just devolved power there, it would be ironic if we were to tie the hands of Stormont by handing over some of their responsibility to the courts, which we would do if we drew that line in the wrong place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister elaborate on one point? I am not going to ask him about individual rights. Will he express a view on the constitutional guarantee that is written in black and white in the agreement? Should that go into the preamble to any additional Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Lady anticipates precisely what I will not do. My answer to her is that I await the view of the commission on that point, and that view can then be played into the overall debate. It is inappropriate for me to give my opinion on such specific issues. It is appropriate that I set out the issues of principle, and some of the related arguments, which I think ought to engage the process. From that process, if everyone that I hope and expect to engage in it assists the commission to supply proper, formulated advice to the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend will then make our position clear in relation to those specifics.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One cannot determine the scope for a Bill of Rights for anyone, unless one has an informed and mature debate about where the responsibilities of the democratic process and politicians lie, and what it is appropriate to express as rights that are justiciable in the courts. There needs to be a debate that hardens that division, and then rights can be drawn on the right side of that line. If the convention does not fully address the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland on that side of the line, a Bill of Rights should fill that lacuna.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0585">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
A carefully crafted Bill of Rights need not tie the hands of politicians unnecessarily, but any proposals must be analysed closely by all the participants in the process to ensure that it is precise, enforceable and answers a real need.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The distinction drawn by my hon. Friend between rights and policies is important. Does that mean that those who argue that a Bill of Rights should be inclusive and extend to social and economic matters are in the area of policy rather than rights? Would a Bill of Rights then cover rights against the state rather than the policies that that state might be operating?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that my hon. Friend is in exactly the area of debate where I want people to be. He is engaging in one of the two great areas of debate on human rights at the present time. One is a mature debate on whether all social and economic rights fall within the province of democratic politics and policy. I shall give a crude example; I hope that the Committee will excuse that. Are we to live in a society in which it is not open to a political party to seek power on the basis that its priority for a given period of government will be, for example, education and to say by definition that it cannot fulfil everyone's expectations in health, housing and other social and economic areas? Or are we to live in a society in which politicians and party policies in relation to social and economic rights will become largely irrelevant because there will be a set of absolute rights or a set of broadly written rights and every decision made by a politician on policy in the social and economic sphere will be second-guessed by an application to the courts?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That may not answer my hon. Friend's question, because there is no simple answer. However, I can confidently say that not all such rights would be excluded from a Bill of Rights, but we must engage in informed debate about where the line will be drawn. We cannot proceed on the basis that every international instrument signed by the Government can be incorporated willy-nilly into the domestic law of the country. We cannot proceed in that way because the majority of such instruments are not drafted with a view to their being so incorporated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who know the history of the European convention on human rights will say that the situation was the same for the convention and that we eventually incorporated it, but we did so in this country with a history of jurisprudence and after decades of the right of personal petition. We incorporated it with a jurisprudence that had moved on and was a dynamic process. We need to engage in that debate, which is all the more important because some people have not done so. Those people felt that it was for others to do that, or they stupidly adopted the view of the former Prime Minister, which was that we do not need human rights because we have a free society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must engage in the debate because of the world in which we live. Those of us who fundamentally believe in human rights, as I and my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister do, must
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
engage in the debate on where the lines are properly to be drawn and not see this as an inexorable process of internationalising every single policy decision. It is the responsibility of democratic politicians in this country. I have gone further than I planned, but I hope that that is clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is much more enlightening when he speaks without his written notes. He gave what he called a crude example, which was, in fact, a very helpful illustration of the Government's thinking at present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for the hon. Lady's kind remarks. The other point made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) was about the relationship between the individual and the state. I take the opportunity that that part of his question gives to put my papers down again and discuss that issue. Northern Ireland is a good example of the deficiencies of a stereotypical attitude towards human rights, and challenges all of us who have an interest in advancing human rights, using the human rights agenda to inform our politics and the future of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a deficiency in an approach that tends to be adopted in a stereotypical fashion, because the structure of human rights that is incorporated in the convention is designed to reflect only the relationship of the individual to the state. For that reason, many people in Northern Ireland have turned their backs on the human rights agenda, because their view is that non-state organisations or other individuals rather than state organisations are responsible for infractions of their human rights. As a result, they believe that the human rights agenda has nothing to offer them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must use those rights as templates for finding ways to regulate and inform the way in which we treat other human beings. Instead of looking at rights from a selfish perspective, we must start looking at rights from the point of view of the other. Instead of "my rights", we must talk more about other people's rights. If we all talked about other people's rights, informed by the principles set out in international instruments and by the convention, we would create an environment in which all those who think that human rights are for other people would be able to engage.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the last Parliament, the Government convinced me that it was right to incorporate the European convention on human rights, although my previous judgment had been against it. I now have difficulty with the Government's saying that perhaps there ought to be a dimension beyond the European convention in terms of detail, extension and expansion. Some of us in the Opposition find it difficult to understand why what was declared in the last Parliament to be the solution—for want of a better word—to the issue now must be a question of debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman takes us to the essence of the debate. It is a mistake to think that the Government are saying that the European convention on human rights does not provide enough rights for the people of Northern Ireland. The Government are
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0586">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
saying that the Belfast agreement—an agreement between both Governments and the parties of Northern Ireland—requires a survey of whether the convention provides sufficient rights in the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland or whether there is a need for supplementary rights in the form of a Bill of Rights. The Government are saying what all Governments should say; "We have reached this point, but that is never the end of the road. We need to look at what road we are going to travel in this area in the future." I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman was persuaded by what I thought were very good arguments for why we should incorporate the European convention on human rights. Not the least of those was that, as we already have a right of personal petition, it is appropriate for our judges to adjudicate on issues in relation to the convention, rather than relying on an international court to do that for us. It is appropriate for us to do that domestically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Gentleman was persuaded by that but I am certain, knowing him and his ability to look beyond today, that he did not think for a minute that that was the end of the debate on human rights. It is not, and is not likely to be. The whole process of rights and equality is a dynamic. Every aspect of law in this country is dynamic, or else it would have been fixed in stone a long time ago. We do not do that; we look at the law and discover that, from where we are now, we have a different view of the future and might need to adjust our position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that we are doing in Northern Ireland, in the context of the requirement in the Belfast agreement, is asking the human rights commission, which has the expertise, to advise us on the scope for supplementing the rights in the European convention on human rights in the future because of the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland. The Government are not saying that the convention is not enough and that we need more. We are saying that we have an open mind about whether it is enough. If we are persuaded by arguments that it is not enough, those additional rights that are necessary for the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland will be reflected in a Bill of Rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hull, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Minister. For the past 10 minutes away from his brief, what he has said has been fascinating and raised many questions. In the context of the Good Friday agreement and the legislation that followed, a new type of right from the old, traditional, individual right was created. That is the concept of community rights and parity of esteem between communities. How does my hon. Friend the Minister see that developing in the light of what he has been saying and of his philosophising on the question of rights and how they will progress?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shudder to think that I was philosophising. I was just trying to articulate my thinking. I do not see myself as a philosopher in any aspect of life, let alone this. My hon. Friend raises an important point, which is an aspect of the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland. His point ought to inform the debate on what those particular circumstances are, just as point from the hon.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) about majorities should. Once there is clarity, or at least some idea of where the parameters of the phrase lie, we have a better chance of identifying what additional rights, within those parameters, the particular circumstances require.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to second-guess any advice that the Secretary of State may get from the commission on that matter, but it is a very legitimate point, which needs to feed into the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure the Minister that what he is saying is every bit as good as any lecture that I had as part of my philosophy degree at Bristol university. I understood him to be saying earlier that the phrase, the "particular circumstances" of Northern Ireland, needs some analysis. Did I understand correctly when I made the assumption that he, like me, believes that human rights are universal and that if a Bill of Rights is truly effective and has been constructed correctly, it succeeds in being effective in any environment? Therefore, whatever we come up with here, the rights themselves should not be conditional on the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland. That should simply be a test of whether we have been sufficiently universal in constructing them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises an interesting issue. I am not really talking philosophy. I am sure that the fact that he can raise that point is informed by his education at Bristol university. I do not have a pat answer to it. First, we need to approximate a definition of the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland. It might run to 40 pages; I do not care. Some attempt needs to be made to define that particular phraseology because it informs the debate. It may be that once that is done and we consider the particular job that the commission has been asked to do, we challenge the accepted wisdom that all rights are universal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be that one needs a situation in which particular circumstances generate a need to identify particular matters as rights, because there needs to be justiciability in relation to them. I am not trying to create an earthquake in relation to the human rights agenda and undermine the accepted wisdom that all rights are universal, but we need to have that debate. What does the phraseology "particular circumstances" mean in Northern Ireland? I am not going to take any more interventions because the next paragraph begins with the word "finally".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I think the debate needs to consider the rather dry subject of enforcement mechanisms. There is a risk that, if we do not think carefully about the rights versus policies debate, we may end up putting forward so-called "rights" that would be difficult to make justiciable. For example, the right for every person to have a "loving and stable" family life may be highly desirable, but is it justiciable? Can any child take their parents to court because they did not feel loved enough? It may sound like I am being flippant, but it is a serious question. If such rights were included in a Bill of Rights, would a two-tier system in effect be created, with some rights being justiciable and universal but not others?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0587">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
Should there be, as some have suggested, a human rights court? Personally, I am not persuaded that that is a necessity. I read the Amnesty briefing with bated breath because it promised to set forth the arguments for such a court, but unfortunately it does not; it just says that there should be one. If we are to mainstream human rights across the entirety of our society, there surely must be a strong argument in favour of human rights being an integral part of the whole justice system, rather than an add-on for a particular court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As with so many issues, there may be no absolute right answer, but it is important that we debate the fundamental questions. Until there is greater clarity and consensus about the fundamental issues, we cannot get into the debate about content. We need to reach a common starting point. We cannot do that without honest and searching debate. As politicians, we have a duty to have that debate. We all need to get involved and get beyond the easy positions of "them" and "us". Human rights, if they are to mean anything at all, must have a large element of universality. We should not be fighting for things for ourselves, but rather setting out in a contract what we want to ensure for others. If a human rights culture is worth striving for, we all have to work together to achieve that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam, for that essential guidance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I start by paying tribute to the human rights commission, its first commissioner, Mr. Brice Dickson, and his colleagues, for having put a vast amount of work into the subject and clarifying it considerably. Although I shall be less than unambiguously flattering about some of the results later in my remarks, it is fair to pay tribute to the great energy and public-spiritedness with which the work has been conducted, and to the real attempts made by the commission to engage with the population of Northern Ireland in a proper consultation exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, I pay tribute to the Government—I do not do that every day of the week—for bringing forward this sitting of the Committee, and for making it clear that they want to consult fully before legislating. I should be the first to criticise them were they to rush into hasty legislation, especially on such a
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
fundamental matter, without adequate consultation. It is only fair to pay tribute to them for doing what I believe is the right thing by Parliament before taking any vital and irrevocable decisions. In the nature of things, foundational or constitutional laws or Bills of Rights tend to be rather longer-term than ordinary legislation, and one has to be particularly careful before one engages in that kind of legislative exercise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, the Opposition do not wish to reach a final view at the present time on whether we should have a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. We wish to hear a little more of the debate and, in particular, we wish those who have been advocating such a Bill of Rights to address the fundamental questions that must be answered, which represent the hurdles that must be crossed if the Opposition are going to support such an initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first hurdle is a question to which the Minister has already referred; why should we have a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland and not for the rest of the United Kingdom? What is the logic of that? The second question is, why should we go further than the European convention on human rights, which we have just incorporated into our domestic law and which has the great virtue of covering the whole of the European Union, including the Republic of Ireland? It covers the whole island of Ireland. Why should one go further? What is inadequate about the ECHR when it comes to Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those questions are touched on and asked in the document that the commission has been good enough to circulate to us—it has been circulated widely in Northern Ireland—but they are not really answered. There is no systematic attempt to engage with them in any of the documents that I have seen. I rather gather from the Minister that he has not seen a systematic argument of that kind, which is what we need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third criterion that will have to be satisfied before we decide to support such an initiative is that there should be an evident consensus in its favour in Northern Ireland. Before one thinks of passing any kind of constitutional amendment or foundational law, it is absolutely essential that it is not based simply on a temporary, partisan majority in a particular legislature but on a wide consensus—bi-partisan or tri-partisan—among those who will be affected. One should not make a constitution, or something that purports to be one, just because one has a majority in the legislature at one particular moment. Obviously, it will not act as a constitution unless a basic consensus underlies it. We must see some evidence of a genuine consensus across the communities in Northern Ireland.

Finally, but not least importantly, if we are to see this initiative progress, we need to be clear in our minds that it will not in any way conflict with, and will hopefully contribute to, the success of the peace process and the normalisation of affairs in Northern Ireland. It should not exacerbate conflict and sectarian divides but go as far as possible to contribute to greater harmony in the divided communities of Northern Ireland. We would not support a venture that looked to us as though it would merely be the basis of a large amount of gratuitous and, no doubt,

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
often sterile, vexatious and extremely expensive litigation in that part of our country. I can see that there might be one group in any community that might be attracted by such a prospect, but it is not an aspiration that we share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out the broad principles that we want to address. I may differ from something that the Minister said a few moments ago by saying that it would be wrong this afternoon not to engage to a certain extent with the substance of the actual Bill of Rights that the commission has produced. One can only go so far in a discussion of whether or not there ought to be a Bill of Rights before seeing the sort of Bill that might be introduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is extraordinarily unlikely—this is a matter not of principle but of pragmatic politics—that we shall have this venture all over again. If Parliament decides that we shall have a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland, the chances are that it will be very like the Bill of Rights in the document. The alternative would be to start the exercise again, appoint a new commission and start a new consultation exercise in Northern Ireland. That would take several years and the Conservatives would no doubt then be responsible for the content of the Queen's Speech. That is an unrealistic approach, so we had better engage with the document, having as competent a discussion as possible on it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to make it clear that the hon. Gentleman is aware that the document before him is a consultation document; it is not an advice document from the commission to the Government. I agree that it is not possible to have an informed debate on a Bill of Rights without referring to individual rights. As a Minister, I am in a particular position in relation to the matter, but I want the hon. Gentleman to be clear that the document is for consultation and is not developed advice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. My comments will be part of the consultation exercise, so it is doubly important that we should not miss this opportunity to state in no uncertain terms what we think about the suggestion; I shall do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed Bill of Rights suffers from a number of shortcomings. Part of it is a little platitudinous and otiose. For example, it states that we are all equal under the law. That is true and no one disagrees with that, but I recall that we were given that right by Magna Carta; it probably has been restated many times since, so that does not take us far down the road.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is wrong. Magna Carta did not extend to my constituency.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed, Magna Carta did not extend to Scotland, but it extended to Ireland. I realise that to you, Mr. McWiIliam, English history before 1603 is not worth going into.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Prince Bishop of Durham would not accept it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assure you, Mr. McWilliam, that Magna Carta extended to all the domains of King John at the time, which included part of France—although he had just lost Normandy, of course—and certainly included Ireland of which he was then Lord.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
The protection of Magna Carta may not have applied at the time of your ancestors, Mr. McWiIliam, or those of the Minister, but they applied to mine and to those of the representatives of the Northern Ireland parties in the Committee. We inherited those rights a long time ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an unfortunate tendency in the document to a lack of precision and to rights being formulated without it being clear who is expected to deliver them. If one thinks of a right as a citizen's asset, who has the corresponding liability? Is it always the state—the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire has asked about that—or is it someone else? That is not always clear. There is a tendency to formulate rights that are unrealistic and illusory. The Minister made a point along those lines and he may agree with what I am about to say on the subject.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The best example is in section 14(d) 1 which states:
	<br><q><p>"Everyone is entitled to an adequate standard of living".</p></q>
From whom are they entitled to that? Is the state supposed to guarantee that, or is it the employer or parent? Who has the corresponding responsibility? What is an adequate standard of living? I foresee endless litigation about that because there is no satisfactory, unambiguous meaning in that provision. Section 14(c) 1 states:
	<br><q><p>"Everyone is entitled to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and well-being."</p></q>
That is a particularly curious way of expressing it. Only God can assure us of that. If the right had been for the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health care, it would no doubt have been the Government to whom we would have looked. In England, we should be grateful to be assured of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health care at present, when the national health service is breaking down. Again, what is intended by such a right? Who will deliver it? How is it to be denned? It is extremely inadequate and rather dangerous—perhaps pretentious would be the right word—to hold out to people the prospect that they can be assured of an adequate standard of living and the best possible health, when in fact such matters are not deliverable in practical terms; they are certainly not easily definable and, therefore, not properly justiciable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A more serious charge from the legal point of view can be delivered against some of the provisions. Let us take one that is probably influenced more than any of the others by political correctness. Consultation clause 5 states:
	<br><q><p>"The State shall take all appropriate measures to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women".</p></q>
None of us is in favour of violence against women, but I hope that none of us is in favour of violence against men. The draft wording may be politically correct, but it lacks the even-handedness that should be absolutely essential in any corpus of law worthy of the name, and certainly in any foundational legal document such as a Bill of Rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another criticism of the document is that it is presumptuous, in that it takes the creation of a Bill of Rights into areas that traditionally have always been a matter for determination by democratically elected
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0589">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
assemblies. For example, criteria for who should be allowed to vote are set out in consultation clause 2 on democratic rights. Incidentally, I noticed that the intention of the commission is that the Bill of Rights should state that everyone aged over 17 should have the right to vote. Later in the document, children are defined as anyone under 18, so there seems to be a slight inconsistency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Consultation clause 2 states:
	<br><q><p>"Elections to the European Parliament, the Westminster Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and local government shall be by a system of proportional representation".</p></q>
It is extraordinary that a Bill of Rights for one province of one country should determine the method of election to the European Parliament. It is extraordinary that the controversial and difficult issue of whether we should have proportional representation to the Westminster Parliament should be decided through a Bill of Rights, let alone a Bill of Rights that covers only one part of the country. Frankly, the draft goes far beyond areas to which any Bill of Rights should properly have regard.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend share my concern that what appears to emerge from the pages of the consultation document is, if I may use the expression, a prostituting of a Bill of Rights in the pursuit of wider political objectives?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend uses strong language that I would not use in the context. However, with the best of intentions, the commission has produced a document that is not a viable prospective Bill of Rights. It would produce far more problems than it would solve and would lead to a great deal of unnecessary and sterile litigation, which is litigation that produces no valid or useful result. It would make no contribution to a sense of justice and would disappoint people. People would feel cheated when they found that the extravagant promises held out to them in a Bill of Rights could not be delivered in the way that they had been led to expect.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope it will be some consolation to the hon. Gentleman to know that the actual terms of reference with which the human rights commission is obliged to work by virtue of the agreement actually ensure that the commission consults and advises on the scope of rights that are supplementary to the convention, dealing with circumstances that are particular to Northern Ireland voting rights. With the greatest respect to women, those rights are not peculiar to Northern Ireland; they have them in the rest of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for what I take to be a supportive argument. I entirely agree with the hon. Lady. Voting rights and women, and many other factors including health care, are not matters that are peculiar to those living in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was immensely surprised by consultation clause 19. Perhaps I could quote it because the Committee may want to reflect on it:
	<br><q><p>"No amendment shall be made to this Bill of Rights without the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly".</p></q>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
That is quite an extraordinary statement to make. It implies that the Westminster Parliament, which would enact the Bill of Rights, should not be allowed to make a change without the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly. That is of course impossible, because it runs counter to the fundamental principles of our constitution, which is that the Queen, or King, in Parliament is sovereign; it follows that no Parliament can bind its successor. I take it that the statement would have no constitutional force. Alternatively, it is not intended to be taken seriously at all because whoever drafted it knew perfectly well that such an attempt to entrench the Bill of Rights would be constitutionally ineffective, in which case the clause would give a very deceptive impression to those who read it, who may not be quite as au fait with constitutional law as those who sit on the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have already said that I believe that the commission has behaved with the utmost integrity and public-spiritedness in the matter, and I know that several distinguished lawyers sit on the commission. Their motivation cannot possibly have been deliberately deceptive, and the clause cannot have found its way into the draft through incompetence. I am mystified as to how the clause got there. It seems to me that whatever the explanation, it was something of an egregious error. I am quite concerned about the document as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For the moment, I have no other criticisms to make of the text that is before us; at least, none that need detain the Committee this afternoon. However, I think that I have said enough to indicate that we have an open mind on whether there should be a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland or not. We will continue to follow the consultation exercise and be guided by the evident opinion in Northern Ireland on that subject. We will look again very closely at the four criteria that I set out earlier. Whether the answer to that question is positive or negative, we are convinced that the text as put forward at the present time is not at all acceptable. There would need, at the very least, to be a substantial modification before it could be seriously considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regretted the tone and substance of the Government's response. I thought that it was negative, lacking in the generosity of spirit of the Good Friday agreement and unhelpful to the process that we are trying to promote. The Government's refusal to provide sufficient funds for the proper functioning of the human rights commission, charged

with the critical role of building cross-community consent, has plagued its development and limited its capacity to promote human rights and dignity in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was the Government's refusal to give the commission the powers needed to send for persons and papers and to take cases on its own behalf that undermined its standing among those who sought to deny it teeth in the first place. It was the Government's refusal in the Committee stage of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to concede vital points of clarification about the powers of the commission that has disrupted its activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Happily, the House of Lords, in its decision in the appeal case yesterday, confirmed that. I quote from that judgment. Paragraph 26 said,
	<br><q><p>"I have not found it necessary to refer to the extracts from Hansard in order to resolve the question on this appeal. I do not however see that the Government's position in what is said there is inconsistent with my conclusions. Mr. McNamara MP's amendment to the Clause which was later section 69 of the Act, would have avoided, at any rate in part, the issue in this appeal since it would have said expressly that with leave of the court the Commission could submit an opinion as amicus curiae. One reason he gave was that that ‘would enable it more effectively to carry out the advisory and educational functions envisaged in the Agreement' ".</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend's position on several such issues is on record, and he has made it clear, but I wish that he would update his position. For example, I wish that he would look carefully at the recent announcements for the financial year 2001–02 on the way in which the commission is being funded. I can see why, if he is quoted in a House of Lords judgment, he wishes to quote that to the Committee. I might do the same myself. But the fact of the matter is that the Government joined the commission in arguing that case in the House of Lords. We were represented in that case. Our position, simply put, was that the commission had those powers, which was why the Government resisted the amendment. The powers were already in the Act. The Government's position has been fully vindicated by the House of Lords. The House of Lords agreed with us that the commission had those powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but if the Government had accepted my amendment, we would not, four years on, have had to take that matter to the court at great expense. I understood very well what my right hon. Friend, now the Secretary of State for Wales, said at that time, but the point made in the House of Lords judgment, nevertheless, is that had that amendment been accepted, we would not have been in that situation. I regret, therefore, that that costly legal battle took place. There was also a draining of other commission resources, which were taken away from its main task.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that the Government have entered into an agreement with the commission. Despite that, the commission is still in the position of always having to go and bid for funds for particular projects. Not having a sure and certain amount of leeway in the funds available to it weakens the commission and its position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the main substance of the debate: the scope for a Bill of Rights or the reason why we need a Bill of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
Rights. It is not just because it is a requirement of the Good Friday agreement, important though that is. It is also because it is a vital building block in the process of peace. Earlier this year, we discussed the Justice (NI) Bill, which prefigures, in important respects, the further devolution of reserved powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Like my hon. Friend, I would like to see that happen as soon as is safe and possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Legislative reform, from the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998, through the Northern Ireland Act 2000 and the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 to the Justice Bill now in the House of Lords, forms part of a process that will consolidate the peace and create the institutional framework for taking the relationship between peoples on these islands forward in a spirit of optimism and good will. At each stage in the process, the guiding principles have been confidence-building, trust and inclusiveness. That should be the aim and scope of any human rights Bill in Northern Ireland. At the time of all-party negotiations leading to the Good Friday agreement, it was not possible to agree on the exact shape of a new police service, which was why the Patten Commission was established to advise on how to create a police service that aspires to serve all sections of the community equally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was not possible to determine all the changes needed to create a criminal justice system, whose impartiality and fairness all sections of the community could respect. The agreement provided a route map that the political parties could use to take the process forward. I think it is now possible to envisage a Department of Justice as part of the governance of Northern Ireland and the further devolution of powers; I hope that will happen soon. However, the cross-community confidence required to take that step requires the building blocks of consent to be put in place.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Bill of Rights that offers the entrenchment of rights protection, over and above the minimum standards of the European convention, is essential. Critically the Bill must embody and strengthen the principle of parity of esteem between both the communities.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman elaborate on the point that he has just made? Does he envisage a hierarchy of rights: the Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, then the European convention of human rights for the rest of the United Kingdom? How does he expect the Bill of Rights to be entrenched in that hierarchy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is what my hon. Friend the Minister said the argument would be about. If we decide that there are particular and special rights for Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement, how do we deal with the question of parity of esteem between the communities, and how do we embody individual rights within community rights? How we balance those factors is part of what this important debate is about. That is what has been set off by the publication of the commission's proposals, and we have to get to the root of it. We have to ensure that nothing undermines the basic principles of the Good Friday agreement: the principle of consent and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
the principle of esteem between the communities. We need to argue about that, think about it and work at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was sufficient that all the parties, the hon. Lady's party and mine, as represented by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, felt that there was a need to explore, through a human rights commission, the establishment of a Bill of human rights for Northern Ireland. We also have to put that into the context of whatever Bill of human rights comes from the Republic, and we have to bear in mind what will happen if the fundamental charter of human rights of the European Community becomes justiciable. That is an interesting question because it contains within it social rights, which raises the whole philosophical question of whether it is merely sufficient to say that a person is entitled to a fair trial, or whether he should be entitled to a fair education. It is important that we consider the way that the argument is developing. I will come on to who should resolve that in a moment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the relevant section of the Belfast agreement is a classic instance of constructive ambiguity? The initial requirement is only that the commission should consult and advise on the scope for defining future legislation. The second sentence goes on to assume a positive answer to that initial statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that one could read that conclusion, but as the Deputy First Minister said, I would rather be dealing with the ambiguities of the Good Friday agreement than dealing with the situation that existed before it. That is the proper way of looking at it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Bill of Rights must seek to consolidate and embody in its principles all that is contained within the agreement. Those have been negotiated by the political parties and endorsed by the people of Ireland, north and south. They have served as a foundation stone for every positive political development since, whether the decommissioning of terrorist weapons or the dismantling of interrogation centres and watch towers. The Good Friday agreement has been working and it is important that its principles are unassailable in law in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the jargon of academia, the nice word consociation is being used and I have seen "consociationalism" written down. I wish that I could pronounce it, but I shall try to explain what it means. It is the ability with which matters have been accepted in Northern Ireland and the way in which the building blocks have been put into the peace process. The first is the principle of cross-community power-sharing with the dual premiership of the First and Deputy First Ministers acting jointly and the inclusive Executive determined by the d'Hondt method. The second is the principle of proportionality applied across the public and private sectors with the election of the Assembly by proportional representation, the award of Committee places by the d'Hondt method and the vigorous and mainstreamed promotion of equality. The third is the principle of community self-government and equality in culture, tradition and ethos marked out by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
notion of parity of esteem that is central to the Good Friday agreement. I keep returning to parity of esteem because that is what makes the Good Friday agreement different. We are discussing community rights, not just individual rights.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregory Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman explain why the proportionality that he alluded to in Northern Ireland and political representation are signally absent in the composition of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was not responsible for the appointment of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Given its composition and some of the problems that it has had, to which I alluded earlier, it has struggled bravely to go ahead. However, it is interesting that the hon. Gentleman made that point when he embodies the principle of the d'Hondt system. That is why he has been a member of the Northern Ireland Executive from time to time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the principle of consent is embodied in consensual devices such as the need for cross-community agreement as laid down in what is contained within the Assembly. I believe that those principles provide a means to address reconciliation in a divided society and further believe that the Good Friday agreement was right to suggest that they be embodied in a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. Those principles must be at the core of any Bill of Rights. I believe that the process of negotiating such an extension of the agreement has the capacity to broaden the consensus so far achieved around the Good Friday agreement and that it can take the process forward. There is good reason why the model of the Good Friday agreement has inspired hope for conflict resolution across the globe. Just as Northern Ireland aspires to be a world leader in the potential for conflict resolution, so too should it provide a model for the institutionalised protection of civil and political rights, and social and economic rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has made an interesting and important contribution along those lines. It still has a contribution to make, but it is now for the political parties in Northern Ireland to devise a method by which agreement can be sought between the parties and can reach the key stakeholders in civic society. That is the way that the process can now be taken forward. It is important to bring the political parties together and for them to sit down and thrash out what should be in such a Bill of Rights, if that is possible. If they can come to that agreement, it will be far more important than any document produced by the commission or any Bill introduced by the Government. If, through their ideas and representation, they can find general agreement on the scope and nature of such a Bill, it would be possible by that method to ensure the general acceptance of what is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the implementation group had some discussion on that matter yesterday and that a number of parties will be meeting bilaterally to see if agreement can be reached. I hope that that will happen and that that aim is achieved. If the parties, after discussion and collaboration with the diverse voices of civil society, can thrash out an agreement away from

the Government, the Bill of Rights becomes their Bill—a Bill that all the people of Northern Ireland can share a sense of ownership of, and, once achieved, reflect on with pride.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.55 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I emphatically praise the Minister and, quite pointedly, those advisers who have contributed to his lucid and erudite speech today. It was one of the most insightful of the many speeches that I have heard him make. It was 48 minutes long, and the Minister was only ever made moribund by his own sense of fairness and his willingness to take so many interventions. As his speech went on, we got very close to the core of the issues before us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In my judgment, the collective spirit that unites people who watch the World cup or the Eurovision song contest, so effectively organised by the people of Estonia, suggests that human beings around the world are not very different. I would go so far as to say that the underlying software in our minds is amazingly similar. That is why, I believe, human rights are basically universal and absolute. The challenge is not so much to debate that but to ensure that anything that we put forward can be applied in any circumstance of the human environment that faces us. For a long time, the Liberal Democrats have believed in the importance of a Bill of Rights, so it is encouraging that we have moved so far in these debates and that the Minister and the Government seem willing to explore the enhancement of the human rights available in the specific environment of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister's comments highlight the crucial danger in such debates. It is extremely easy to mix up policies and principles. That point has already been made. The clearest analogy for me would be with physics. The laws of physics do not change, but those affecting one particular phenomenon or circumstance can have a different emphasis. In the same sense, human rights do not change but the relevance of one right or another varies according to the specific circumstances. That is my first substantive point. Success for us is not to create rights specific to Northern Ireland. It is to ensure that the rights are defined in such a way that they work in Northern Ireland, although the same rights, the same Bill, should effectively work elsewhere too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I, for one, would be rather concerned if we believed that the citizens of Northern Ireland were entitled to certain rights that were not applicable to citizens elsewhere in the United Kingdom or elsewhere on the planet. We are not discussing culturally specific matters when we discuss rights. There is a link with the rule of law. One reason why we sometimes get confused between a right and a policy is that we miss the fact that the courts are there not to define rights, in a fundamental sense, but to apply them to the circumstances presented to them in the legal environment. That was, I think, the intention of strand 3 of the Good Friday agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One reason for being extremely cautious is because of the phrase
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
	<br><q><p>"to reflect the particular circumstances in Northern Ireland".</p></q>
The Minister rightly highlighted the danger of assuming that the circumstances in Northern Ireland are so specific that the rights need, in some way, to be different there. My second substantive point is to underline the importance of not being seduced, by the need to encourage and nurture a more normal environment in Northern Ireland, into believing that one mechanism is to introduce rights there that do not exist anywhere else. That is a direct consequence of my first point.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some of us feel that the hon. Gentleman's position produces some fundamental problems. He expresses a set of rationalist assumptions that absolute rights exist that can be easily worked out in any set of circumstances. However, circumstances alter cases, and special cases exist in Northern Ireland. It may well mean that the legal interpretation in Northern Ireland of human rights is somewhat different from the interpretation elsewhere, and certainly different from other sections of the world a long way away from Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is exactly the debate before us, and the hon. Gentleman is entitled to make that point. He is right: I do take a rationalist view when it comes to rights. I believe that if we are successful in this matter—not without difficulty—we can define rights in such a way that they would be applicable in Estonia, Zimbabwe, America or Northern Ireland and that what would change is the specific application of the points. For example, as the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Mr. Davies) made it clear, the consultation document refers to proportional representation. Everyone knows that the Liberal Democrats are in favour of proportional representation—fair votes. To me, that is not a right but the application of a right. Perhaps the fundamental right is the right to expect one's voice to be heard in a proportionate fashion when it comes to electing politicians to service. D'Hondt may be a great system, but it is not a right; it is an application. If we phrase the rights correctly, the application will be determined by local politicians and tested by local courts. Right hon. and hon. Members are entitled to draw their own conclusions, but that is the submission that I would like to make, given that it has already been confirmed that the debate today is to be taken as part of the consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister rather modestly sought to distance himself from the possibility that this was a philosophical debate. Qualified as I am with a 2:1 single honours degree in philosophy from Bristol university, I feel confident to bestow on him at least a temporary honorary degree in philosophy for the purpose of the debate today, because it is a matter of philosophical consideration to determine which of us is correct in our assumptions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Having studied philosophy—I did it as a special joint degree—I am surprised that none of those rationalist assumptions were challenged and removed from the hon.

and has, perhaps, showed charity by not challenging me further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford made similar points. He gave some insightful examples of where we risk mixing up policies and rights. He rightly pointed out that the right to physical and mental well-being may, in fact, be the application of a right, whereas the right is that individuals should expect society to maximise their well-being in specific fashions. The right to expect the absence of violence against women may be a specific policy application of a fundamental right not to experience violence from other human beings. However, even that is conditional. Britain has recently embarked on a war against terrorism and, inevitably, individuals have been harmed as a result.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Therefore, my third substantive point is that one cannot get away from the fact that rights exist in a hierarchy—that has already been alluded to in the debate—and that if we are to create something workable in the consultation, we must recognise that there is a priority of rights in application, each subject to the next. The consequence of not doing that will be to create a situation that is impossible to enforce. We will create a situation in which the law has to be interpreted by courts, whether there is a contradiction or not, and we will put public servants or individuals who fall foul of those contradictions in an impossible and probably litigious situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my fourth substantive point. My feeling is that it is hard to get to the fundamental rights, but the more simply we define such rights, the more effective they will be. I would suggest that rather than seeking rules, we are looking for guidelines. For me personally, the guidelines relate to maximising the freedom of individuals to live as they please, and in that context, to minimise the harm that we do to each other as we live out our lives. Freedom and the no-harm principle are familiar to anyone who has studied philosophy before. There may be others, but I suggest those because the simpler we make the definition, the more effective it can be. Mr. McWilliam, you gave a good example earlier on when you generously allowed us to take our jackets off if we wished. An alternative would have been to assume that we had the right to sit in a cooler room. Even there we could have had a debate achieving the same result in two different ways. It is not at all easy to get that hierarchy correct, but unless we do, we will end up with significant difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have three more short points—[	<i>Interruption</i>.] I ask hon. Members to contain their excitement because they will no doubt be able to make their points as well. I continue to be concerned about the "both communities" terminology. Northern Ireland is not two communities, but many. I fear that the more often we say things such as
	<br><q><p>"mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities",</p></q>
the more we inadvertently discriminate against those people who do not want to be regarded as part of one of those two main, admittedly large, communities.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
What about the Baha'is, the Chinese or the few Estonians who live in Northern Ireland and adamantly feel that those categorisations do not work? I will take this the last intervention, Mr. McWilliam, and I commit to finish in the next two minutes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know that the hon. Gentleman is a strong supporter of the Belfast agreement. The mandate of the commission does tie it to looking at additional rights to reflect the principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities, and parity of esteem. That is where the terminology has come from. It has not been dreamed up by the rest of us; it is actually in the agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I know where it comes from, but I have disagreed with the terminology from the outset. I do not think that it helps us to enshrine the situation in the legislation, which ironically is all about human rights. The actual step to take is to think about walking the talk in terms of respecting the diversity of Northern Ireland communities in the terminology that we use in the documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another concern I have is that any modern Bill of Rights should reflect all rights, be they civil, political, economic, social or cultural. However, we should always remain at a strategic level, rather than being tempted to create a shopping list, which may create a litigious society at the end of the day. My feeling with regard to enforcement is that, as the Minister said, laws are there to protect and enforce rights. It is very important that we recognise that rights at their most effective are enforced by the attitudes within the societies in which they are created.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At heart, democracies serve the public, not rule them. They enable, not enslave, and they liberate, not litigate. As a result, I remain ever-vigilant and ever-concerned that we do not inadvertently create enormous potential for litigation in society, where individuals end up spending huge amounts in legal insurance to ensure that they are not sued because of the inadvertent consequences of well-meaning legislation. I am sure that we will have opportunities to discuss that further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is good that we are moving forward. I am extremely positive about the discussion. It looks like a unique opportunity to draft a comprehensive, modern, effective and forward-looking Bill of Rights for a divided society, the history of which has been marked by intolerance. Looking ahead, let us recognise that it is not an opportunity simply to regulate life in Northern Ireland in a fair way. It is an opportunity to take the philosophical challenges before us and create something so robust that, with little change, it could legitimately be applied to the rest of the United Kingdom. This is not so much about giving people a chance for an equal life in Northern Ireland; it is about giving people the chance for a good life in general. That is territory that should attract us all.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gregory Campbell 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unlike some of the other hon. Members who either majored in philosophy or have dealt with that side of the issue, I want to look at the scope of the Bill in terms of how I believe many people in Northern Ireland will view the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
concept, and how it may well be enacted on the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I fully agree with the Minister over his discussion of and reference to the genesis of the scope of the Bill when he traced it back directly to the Belfast agreement. It is my view, and that of the people whom I represent, that the genesis of a Bill of Rights must be right. If it is not, and if it is not something that the people of Northern Ireland, in their diversity, can accept and support, and want to see the development of, mistakes will be made. If the genesis of the Bill is going to be enshrined in the Belfast agreement, it will in essence have opposition from my community, which is deeply suspicious of all that surrounds the Belfast agreement because of the way in which it has been manipulated and used to the disadvantage of the Unionist community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I alluded in an intervention to the composition of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. That is not only regrettable but a matter that has to be addressed. The composition of the commission is such that not a single member, as I understand it, comes from the bulk of the Unionist community. That is not to say that it does not have any pro-Union members; it does. But none of its members shares the views that we, the bulk of the Unionist community, hold—opposition to the Belfast agreement and wanting to see a fair system of government to which both communities can give allegiance, rather than the Belfast agreement to which only the Nationalist community and a minority of Unionists give allegiance. That must be addressed. We simply cannot have a human rights commission that is not broadly based continuing to give advice and make decisions. That is simply not tolerable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My concerns go further. In preparation for the debate, the commission circulated Members—I presume other Members have received copies, as I did—with a briefing. It refers to a survey that it carried out during the past six months, which gives rise to further concerns. The questions contained in the survey, which address the scope of a Bill of Rights, are very partisan.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Table 3 in the summary from the commission shows time after time the distinction between the two main communities and how they would view specific protections for particular rights in Northern Ireland. Over and over again, in virtually every element of every question asked, there is a lower proportion of people from the Unionist community than from the Nationalist community who would support specific rights. That is the case both with bland matters, such as the right to health care or the right to an adequate standard of living, and with more specific ones, such as the continued application of the Bill if there were a united Ireland. I see no question regarding the continued application of the Bill if there were an independent Ulster. Why should that not be considered? I am not someone who would advocate and favour an independent Ulster, but it is at least as tenable a proposition as that of a united Ireland, and no more unlikely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
I shall deal with some of the wording of the consultation document, which continually uses the phrase
	<br><q><p>"the conflict in Northern Ireland".</p></q>
It uses that phrase as if there were some parity between victims and perpetrators. Unfortunately, the whole usage of the word conflict permeates Government thinking. The relatives of innocent victims in Northern Ireland are very deeply concerned at that mythical parity—that in some way there is a conflict between diverging political opinions. In fact, what has happened over the years has been not conflict, but a perception that those who advocate violence and terror can get political change because of the advocacy of that violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to close because I am conscious that others want to speak. The scope of any Bill must be enshrined in and have as its basis the fundamental support of both communities in Northern Ireland. There is a perception among the Unionist community that the human rights enshrined in and advocated by the commission can be more easily supported by Nationalists. We must avoid that at all costs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I ask the hon. Gentleman a question? This is a point of information rather than point-scoring. Did any anti-agreement Unionist apply for membership of the commission when it first advertised or for any of the new appointments?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Campbell</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The short answer is yes, but they were unsuccessful given that no one represents their point of view on the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall conclude by referring to the scope of the Bill and how perpetrators of violence—those who support and advocate violence and those who are passive—would view a proposed Bill. The rest of Northern Ireland—more than 90 per cent, of the population, Unionist and Nationalist, Loyalist, Protestant and Catholic—want a Bill that would be useful to peace-loving democrats who would be able to avail themselves of it in circumstances outlined by the Minister and other members of the Grand Committee. If the Government allow a Bill of Rights to be perceived in such a way that perpetrators of violence see it as a charter or mechanism by which they can promote an agenda that leaves democrats opposed not to the principle of human rights, but to how it is implemented in Northern Ireland, that would be deeply regrettable. I hope that the Government will take steps to avoid that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in the happy position of being able to report that the Ulster Unionist party, for the first time in its history, had a meeting to discuss a Bill of Rights and human rights protection generally. That took place last Thursday and the date was set before this meeting of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee, so it was a happy coincidence. It was a very well-attended meeting—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Are we to understand that the official position of the hon. Lady's party's is that there should be a Bill of Rights for the Province?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was a meeting that brought together Ulster Unionist members, some of whom were not in favour of the agreement and some of whom were in favour. The consensus was that, as the agreement was endorsed by the vast majority of the population—more than 70 per cent.—in a referendum in 1998 and 13 lines in it were dedicated to a Bill of Rights, we should make a contribution to any forthcoming Bill.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I strongly recommend to the Government that as the agreement has been endorsed by a majority in referendums both in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, they should take the opportunity to make it work for all the population of Northern Ireland, not just for a specific section of it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Quentin Davies</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just want to pursue the question that my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) asked. It is true that the Belfast agreement provides for a commission to examine the scope for a Bill of Rights. Everyone in the Room accepts that a commission should be set up and that the question should be examined. However, the agreement did not prejudge the answer to the question of whether there should be a Bill of Rights; that is what the consultation exercise is about. My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke asked if the Government had decided in principle whether to have a Bill of Rights. I am interested in the answer to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to explain that the meeting that we had last week was the first in a series of seminars that we hope to hold. As two interventions indicated, as a party we were most unhappy about the original composition of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Despite its title, it endorsed religious discrimination in the recruitment of new police officers and damaged its reputation and standing within the Unionist community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not crystallised our view on a Bill of Rights. There is debate in the party. Under the terms of the agreement, the commission was invited to consult and advise on the scope for defining rights and we have not yet resolved whether that extends to a detailed Bill of Rights. What is clear is that in the terms of the agreement, any Bill of Rights should be supplementary to the European convention on human rights and should reflect the circumstances of Northern Ireland, drawing as appropriate on international instruments and experience. The experience of Northern Ireland is often compared, particularly by the commission, to that of South Africa. I understand from the eminent South African constitutional judge, Albie Sachs, that it took lawyers in South Africa six years of hard work to draft the charter of human rights for South Africa. I, therefore, urge the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission not to repeat its previous performance, to which the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford referred, of rushing to draft the consultation document. Many expectations of a Bill of Rights have built up through the consultation and it has to be right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>32</span>
The other point that I would like to draw to the Minister's attention is to emphasise that we are asked to consider issues that are supplementary to the European convention on human rights and reflect "particular circumstances" of Northern Ireland. A particular circumstance in Northern Ireland, which should be addressed in the Bill of Rights, is the right to parade. I am obviously not a card-carrying member of the Orange Order or the Ancient Order of Hibernia—[	<i>Interruption.</i>]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The use of mobile phones, even to send text messages, is not in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. McWilliam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rights to assemble, to free association and to join a trade union are enshrined in European law. The right to parade is a huge issue in Northern Ireland. If a Bill of Rights comes into force, there should be provision for any group wishing to parade.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Parades Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission have rather unhelpfully referred to article 11 of the European convention on human rights and have given the incorrect impression that that article covers parading. I do not agree and the issue should be addressed. The agreement also makes it clear, in the 13 lines dedicated to the subject of any future Bill of Rights, that there should be a clear formulation of the rights not to be discriminated against and to equality of opportunity in the public and private sectors. I repeat that that should be implemented to include the Police Service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was wrong that one of the first things that the British Government did—having set in train a new human rights commission and placed a new emphasis on human rights—was to distort the provisions of the agreement in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. That is wholly demeaning to good young Catholic recruits who are in the service on merit, but can never prove it. Freedom from discrimination on the grounds of religion or whatever else must be written into a Bill of Rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the points that we must deal with. I appreciate the fact that the Minister, having put down his notes, was much more illuminating than when he stuck to his text. There is much discussion to be had in my party, but at least we have made a start.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We need to remind people about this issue. It is inevitable. We are here because of the Belfast agreement, which I supported and support, so we have to try to find our way round a number of difficult problems connected with human rights. I welcomed the opening statement by my hon. Friend the Minister, because he drew attention to some of the difficulties that we must consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One problem with the notion of human rights is that it is almost impossible for anyone to say, "I am opposed to human rights." That is a difficulty because it means that something about this notion carries so much weight that everyone will try to grab hold of it

for their own purposes and write in the details according to what these noble-sounding values are.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that we should consider the issue differently from the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit Öpik), who seemed to take a very rationalist position. He seemed to say that rights are universal, they exist for all time and we can observe and determine what they are. In fact, they are not. They alter what is the right thing to do according to different circumstances and conditions. I hope that that will be taken into account, because it might be particularly appropriate for Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.27 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall occupy the last three minutes of the debate with considerable guilt, given the time that I took at the beginning. However, those who intervened on me are entirely responsible. They were warned what would happen if the interventions were of the quality and frequency of those in the debates that we have had in this Room before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In three minutes, I cannot do justice to the numerous and sometimes complex points made by members of the Committee. However, it does give me an opportunity to thank them. In the last two hours, there has been more of an opportunity to have a concentrated debate on this issue than perhaps there has ever been in Parliament. We may need to look for other opportunities to debate the issue again, because much remains to be said. Perhaps we will have debates in another format, depending on whether members of the Committee agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have enjoyed the debate. The contributions from both sides of the Committee have been thoughtful. However, I do not agree with everything that has been said. I disagree principally with the now dated view of my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
McNamara) of the relationship between the Government and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. He may need to consult the commission as to its view of its relationship with the Government and particularly the relationship with the Minister for human rights in Northern Ireland, and update his position. These things have to be said, however, and it is important that we engage in debates about them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I can fit in one or two general points. First, I associate myself with the recognition by the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford of the expertise, commitment and hard work that the commission has put into the work that has been done on the issue thus far. The fact that the quality of debate is so good is a credit to its work and a reflection of how right my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was in his appointments. I am satisfied that the commission is properly representative of the diverse communities of Northern Ireland. Well-qualified people applied for the post of commissioners when additional commissioners were added, and not everyone could be appointed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
