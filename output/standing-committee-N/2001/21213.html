	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Desmond Browne)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Committee has considered the proposal for a draft Criminal Injuries Compensation (Northern Ireland) Order 2001.</p></q>
I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. McWilliam, with or without your voice. The Committee is sitting today to consider the Government's proposals for draft legislation to allow the new criminal injuries compensation scheme to be introduced in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that hon. Members will recall the background to the Committee's involvement in considering draft Orders in Council. The Chairman of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs suggested earlier in the year that future draft Orders in Council on reserved matters should be referred to the Northern Ireland Grand Committee. I wholeheartedly agree with this addition to the legislative process, and I hope that hon. Members will take the opportunity to express their views on the draft proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may be useful to mention the current status of the proposed legislation, which was published on 28 June. On 30 November, the statutory consultation period ended on the draft order and scheme under section 85 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.1 have since received a report from the Northern Ireland Assembly on its consideration of the proposals and my Department has received a further 13 representations from interested individuals and organisations. My officials are considering all the responses, and there will be a comprehensive report on the concerns expressed before final decisions are made on the draft order, which will be laid before the House early next year. Any views expressed by the Committee will be factored into that report and given due consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before I talk about the substance of the proposals, I will spell out the basic principles that govern the payment of criminal injuries compensation. Some views that have been aired by members of the National
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
Assembly and others make me suspicious about the level of knowledge and the recognition of those principles, and it will be helpful to the debate if they are restated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state is not liable for injuries caused to people by the acts of others. A state compensation scheme that is funded by the taxpayer cannot reasonably be expected to match the damages that are awarded in the civil courts where personal or corporate liability has been established. The state is not liable for the criminal acts of others, and a victim can sue an offender if there is a reasonable chance of securing damages. However, in recognition of the public sense of responsibility for, and sympathy with, the blameless victim, the state provides a monetary award on behalf of the community. Any compensation scheme that depends on public funds needs to strike a balance between the needs of the victim and the interests of the taxpayer. There will always be an argument about where that balance should lie. The need to establish equilibrium between those two interests seems to be missing from the National Assembly's consideration of the proposals, but it is fundamental to the understanding of a state compensation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Claims under the scheme are essentially risk-free. The attacker does not have to be caught, nor does his identity have to be established. The victim does not have to bring a court action and risk losing and the attacker does not have to have the means or the will to pay any damages awarded. A successful claim to the Compensation Agency will invariably be paid. There is no right amount of compensation. People often say that no amount of money can compensate them for the hurt or loss that they have suffered, but the simple fact is that last year the Northern Ireland scheme paid out over £40 million to more than 7,000 victims; the average award was £5,600. Our scheme is probably the most comprehensive and generous in the world, and will remain so under the proposed tariff arrangement. I emphasise that in Great Britain, the tariff scheme pays out more than all other schemes in Europe added together. Those who criticise our scheme should bear in mind that under many foreign schemes, victims receive far less compensation, or even no compensation at all, for the pain that they suffer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scheme will no longer aim to provide individually tailored compensation covering each and every head of damage that might be awarded in a successful civil suit. If victims want that, they are free to sue the attacker, if his identity is known and if it is worth while to do so. The Government believe that the tariff scheme is the right approach for Northern Ireland. It is straightforward, transparent and simple for victims to understand. It gives victims a good idea from the start of how much money they are likely to get and pays out more quickly than the present scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the substance of the debate and of the draft proposals, I want to begin where I think we properly should: with the victims of violent crime in Northern Ireland. No member of the Committee needs to be reminded of the horrendous consequences for many people of the years of violence that were
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0560">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
spawned by civil unrest and generated through terrorism. Although the violence emanating from that scar on our past may now be greatly diminished, the surviving victims are, in many cases, victims for life—as are many victims of ordinary violent crime. The Government recognised that unfortunate fact in 1997 when the then Secretary of State announced the establishment of a Victims Commission to look at ways of providing greater recognition for victims of the troubles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The origins of the draft proposals that we are discussing are found in the report of the Victims Commissioner, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield. I therefore stress that we are debating proposals that have their roots firmly based in the desire to create a better deal for victims of violent crime. In his report, "We Will Remember Them", Sir Kenneth Bloomfield recommended a review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme. He was not asked to look at that particular area—he did so as a result of evidence he received during his work as Victims Commissioner that pointed to a significant level of dissatisfaction with the current arrangements. The Government accepted the recommendation and referred the review back to him. That review also started exactly where it should have—with the victims of violent crime, their needs and their requirements.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The independent review was established in 1998 and reported in June 1999. Its remit was to recommend a new statutory framework for the payment of compensation, taking into account the experiences of victims of the troubles. It was also under a duty to look at the way in which other jurisdictions compensated victims of violent crime, and the need for fairness, equity, openness and affordability.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome anything that will provide a better deal for victims. I am somewhat concerned that obstacles might be put in the way of genuine victims under paragraph 14(d) and (e) of the report. There are cases, in which young men get caught up in trouble early in their lives, when they were immature, and end up with a criminal record. Later in their lives they seek to distance themselves from that involvement, but nevertheless suffer because of it, perhaps at the hands of the organisation with which they were involved. That seems to show that in considering their past and associations—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be brief. If the hon. Gentleman wants to make a speech, he can do so later. That intervention was too long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I finish my question?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, the hon. Gentleman may not. He was supposed to be making an intervention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to the issue, even if it is out of sync with the introductory remarks that I wanted to make. There is an on-going debate about whether a victim's record should be taken into account in respect of criminal injuries compensation, and if so, to what extent. To a significant degree, the proposals are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
designed to elicit comments on that issue. In Northern Ireland, having one type of previous conviction has disqualified people entirely from receipt of compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By and large, criminal injuries compensation schemes exist to compensate blameless victims of violent crime. As I understand it and as the hon. Gentleman points out, that applies to the previous scheme and, to a significant degree, to this one. The basic question is whether public money should be set aside for such a scheme to compensate someone who was blameless on a particular occasion, but otherwise led a violent life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All schemes try to strike that balance appropriately, but it is difficult. I am sure that as the debate progresses, the hon. Gentleman will appreciate that we think that we have got the balance right with this scheme, but his point is well made. At some point, all societies must allow people to live down their past. I need not advise those who represent the people of Northern Ireland how important that judgment is and has been in that society, particularly over the last decade or so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister may elaborate on this point later. Has this compensation scheme adjusted the rules about taking such people into consideration?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for his question. The scheme will introduce considerable discretion. In a sense, it responds to the request for such discretion from the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs). In the context of Northern Ireland, that requires us to take into account offences that could be categorised as terrorist offences. Broadly, the proposal is that those offences be considered in the same discretionary manner as other previous offences. I shall come to that later, when hon. Members will no doubt want to contribute. Interestingly, if I understand the Assembly's comments correctly, it supported that approach to compensation. I can understand why it is another necessary step if Northern Irish society is to move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The terms of reference for the review were given to Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, although I do not think that he identified himself in his original report as the person who should be given the onerous task of conducting the review. He suggested that the job should be done and he was the right person to do it, because of his background and the information that he had accumulated. There was no mention of a tariff scheme in those terms of reference, and his recommendations were the genesis of the proposal before the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In its conclusion, the review pointed out the importance of appreciating that no imaginable scheme could satisfy all the relevant interests in every particular. This legislation does not attempt to meet that impossible objective. The review realised that a balance would have to be struck between issues of affordability for the public purse, predictability of expenditure, which is obviously important for
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0561">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>7</span>
managing budgets and paying tolerable compensation. They stress that
	<br><q><p>"nothing in the course of our work has shaken a conviction that arrangements in Great Britain, let alone the one in Northern Ireland, are generous to victims in comparison with the arrangements prevailing in other jurisdictions."</p></q>
Members of the Committee will remember my earlier reference to the gross amount of money being paid by reference to the rest of Europe. We should not lose sight of that premise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sir Kenneth's conclusions and those of his colleagues, one of whom is a highly respected social services professional with much experience in dealing with the consequences of traumatic incidents for individual victims, were reached only after lengthy consultations with people who had been the victims of criminal violence, and with organisations representing such individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to place on record the Government's gratitude to members of the review team, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, Professor Desmond Greer and Mrs Marion Gibson, who each brought a specialism to the review. Their report is a major piece of research into criminal injuries compensation in Northern Ireland.

The evidence gathered by the review found that the main concerns about the existing common law-based criminal injuries compensation scheme centred on difficulties in the process of accessing compensation. For example, many people who thought that they should have been eligible for an award were not; others were, but found the process so humiliating, traumatic and lengthy that they sometimes wished that they had not bothered in the first place, especially if, at the end, the award was perceived as notional. Others felt excluded as their solicitors and barristers entered the adversarial ring and bartered with each other, over the heads of their clients, about the quantum of awards. Many felt a great sense of unfairness and inequity as they saw or heard of other cases involving similar injuries being settled at enormously varying amounts. Court appearances were seen as at best uncomfortable and at worst humiliating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In response, Sir Kenneth concluded that the adversarial process, which underpins the settlement of civil claims and therefore the common law based criminal injuries compensation scheme, was itself partly responsible for much of the discontent. It follows, therefore, that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to maintain a common law system, while at the same time solving the grievances expressed by so many.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would take all day if I were to take issue with every aspect of the Law Society's evidence to the ad hoc Committee of the Assembly with which I disagree. I have another speech that is three times the length of this one and the first two thirds of it is devoted to that. I decided to spare the Committee that lengthier speech, but I may be forced into making it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Law Society made several generalised statements to the ad hoc Committee with which I take issue, one of which is the assertion that there is an absence of support from victims for the proposals. The Law Society's assertion that a majority of respondents wanted no change is, in my understanding of the report, clearly wrong. Chapter 7 of the report details the concern about and the criticisms of the current arrangements in Northern Ireland in some significant detail from its researches. The overall thrust of the evidence focused on the need for a scheme of compensation that contains as few elements as possible that could cause additional stress or pain to the applicants. My reading of the report is that because of the weight of criticism from victims of the current scheme, the review concluded that the scheme needed to be reformed, root and branch. Otherwise, one cannot understand the review. The Law Society has fundamentally failed to understand the report if it is arguing that the report sets out the reasons for change, but from talking to victims, finds that it had not come about. The report is substantially based on the views of victims, which is why it came to the conclusion that it did.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon.

My role as Minister behoves me to accept some recommendations and reject others and have a logical reason for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government were under no obligation to accept the detail of the recommendations. However, they were compelled to accept the main thrust, which expressed deep concern about the status quo, and a desire for a more transparent system. That would achieve the objective of preventing a significant amount of money from leaving the system and ending up in the hands of the legal profession. Transparency was necessary to ensure predictability and certainty. The review recommended a hybrid scheme, which was rejected because of the disparities that would occur at the top end of the tariff and the lower end of common law. Under a hybrid scheme, only about 10 per cent. of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0562">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>9</span>
cases would have been dealt with using the common law approach, but the tariff would cater for about 90 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having accepted the general thrust, we could apply it to all the recommendations and achieve Sir Kenneth's objectives. We accepted the main thrust of his argument, but felt that we could achieve his objectives by applying the same approach to all claims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The review recommended that for all claims below a certain value—less serious injuries that do not prevent a person from eventually returning to a normal way of life—a tariff approach should be adopted. I would stress that the vast majority of claims fall into this category: 89 per cent. of such claims were settled for under £10,000 in 2000–01. It also recommended that legal costs should be withdrawn from the scheme in tariff cases, and that released funding of £5m should be redistributed to allow more victims to have access to the compensation scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report was published in July 1999 and copies were placed in the library of the House. The Government conducted a public consultation exercise on the findings of the review, and in June 2000 published their response. In June, we published a draft set of proposals that were subject to consultation with the Northern Ireland Assembly and others, until the consultation period expired on 30 November.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals that we are debating today, on which others have had the opportunity to raise concerns, fundamentally change the way in which a victim of violent crime obtains financial compensation for injuries. They do not change the principles on which our system of compensation is based, which provide that, by way of a financial award, the state recognises the wrong done to an individual through a crime of violence by a third party. The absolute right of the victim remains to pursue the legal liability of that third party to pay compensation as determined in a civil action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed changes will ensure that those requiring access to the compensation scheme have to negotiate as few hurdles as possible to achieve a fair and adequate award. The system should be simple, straightforward, transparent and open. It should lead to a fair award of compensation based on current average values.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although Northern Ireland is a separate jurisdiction with separate civil case law, which has led to the evolution of its own criminal injuries compensation scheme, concerns have often been expressed about the disparity of treatment between criminally injured victims in Northern Ireland and those in the rest of the United Kingdom. Consequently, to aid us in producing a system with the necessary attributes, we used as a template the system that has operated successfully in Great Britain for more than five years. We had also to have regard to the scheme already in existence, along with the broader principle of parity of public expenditure where it is achievable and practicable. Our response to Sir Kenneth's recommendations took account of those objectives
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
and, without adverse outcome on victims of crime in Northern Ireland, we sought to achieve parity with the structure of the scheme in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have proposed that all claims should be settled on the basis of an injuries tariff with set values, with additional compensation in certain circumstances for loss of earnings or earning capacity, costs associated with long-term care and other related special expenses, and dependency, bereavement and funeral expenses in fatal cases. We must bear in mind that most cases are settled without the need for additional compensation. For example, less than 1 per cent. of all cases that are settled are for awards of more than £50,000.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that a straightforward injury will attract a straightforward tariff award, as listed in the literature that will be made available to applicants. For example, a simple broken nose—if there is such a thing—will attract £2,500, as will a dislocated jaw or temporary blurred vision lasting less than 13 weeks. Under the current common law-based arrangements, the Compensation Agency's "Guidelines to Offers" recommend settling those injuries between £1,750 and £2,750. Committee members will see that we have pitched the tariff in what statisticians might call the upper quartile of the range of likely awards. The new tariff awards will also include a small percentage amount to cover any pecuniary loss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The aim in all cases is to enable the victim to access compensation without the need for lengthy and cumbersome bureaucratic and legal processes. It will also allow applicants to know from the start how much they are entitled to, and reassure them that their injuries are worth exactly the same as those of anyone else in a similar position. For more serious injuries where recovery is slow and affects the ability to work for more than 28 weeks, the scheme allows for lost earnings or earning capacity to be compensated on an individual basis.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way. There are so many opportunities that I would like to take, but I want to hear what he has to say before I intervene again. On his last point, that is a radical change from the present scheme in which loss of earnings is awarded from the time of the injury. What justification is there for the 28-day delay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a very good question, and there is a very good answer. We are making this radical change to the scheme to simplify it. Had we allowed comparatively small claims to be bogged down in the necessity of proof of loss of earnings over 28 weeks, we would have recreated an aspect that is causing much difficulty and delay to the current system. Instead of doing that, we built into the tariff an element for loss of earnings for those 28 weeks. In calculating the tariff, we examined one year's settlement of claims of more than £10,000 and calculated the average settlement. We discovered that it fitted into the range specified in the guidelines that were issued to those who settled claims on behalf of the board. We then aggregated the claims and worked out the element of the aggregate that was attributable to pecuniary loss. It came to 1.85
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0563">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
per cent., so we added 1.85 per cent. to every claim. Thus, across the board, there was an element in every tariff to represent the 28 weeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that that is a tariff-based system. It was not intended to be precise but to be fair, open and transparent. It includes a built-in element, but the amount of work to calculate that part of the total compensation was clearly disproportionate. An enormous amount of paperwork and calculation were required for 1.85 per cent. of the claim. Instead of insisting on all that work and proof, we have said that everyone will get it, thus, we can cut out the first 28 weeks. That seems to be consistent with the tariff-based approach and fair to everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee may be able to come up with another calculation method; I am sure that those who calculate such things could come up with any number of methods. However, I think that that was a fair way to do it, and it allows us to avoid a great deal of difficulty.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a slightly separate matter, the Minister rightly points out that a tariff-based system will ensure that each individual gets the same amount for a given injury. How will the system factor in the vastly different consequences for individuals with similar injuries and suffering? To allow more variability, should the system not have more flexibility than a tariff-based system offers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman leads me to my next point. If there is a disproportionate consequence, the effect on the individual will be measured. If recovery from a serious injury is slow and affects the ability to work for more than 28 weeks, the scheme allows for lost earnings. The calculation for that would be on an individual basis. Similarly, if an injury has a disproportionate effect on the individual's employment prospects, the total award will reflect a loss of earning capacity. In other cases, a mental illness brought on by the effect of an injury might prevent the applicant from returning to their normal employment. That loss, either by way of lost earnings or earning capacity, can be compensated under the terms of the scheme. Therefore, the calculation of the award would reflect the seriousness of the injury and the effect that it has on the applicant's life. That is how civil law calculations are made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be wrong to think that the new arrangements are solely predicated on a tariff. Such arrangements were described in the report of the independent review as a modified tariff if
	<br><q><p>"compensation in the case of more serious injuries and death are (subject to the 28 week rule) assessed on a combination of a tariff and a modified common law approach."</p></q>
As a consequence of restructuring the scheme—this time against the advice of the review team—we proposed that the current right of appeal to the courts on quantum or eligibility should be replaced by a right of appeal to an independent criminal injuries compensation appeals panel. Such a move mirrors arrangements in Great Britain that have operated successfully for five years and, although at present
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
some 3,000 appeals are decided each year, only 13 per cent.—or 390 cases—receive a full hearing. If my memory serves me correctly, only 109 cases received a full hearing in which the applicant was successful. A significant amount of time, energy, and money is spent on legal advice for applicants for whom the scheme pays, for a minuscule product.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It follows that many cases can be settled without the full panoply of the judicial process, which takes on average over two years. The evidence given to Sir Kenneth Bloomfield overwhelmingly suggests that court appearances increase the trauma for victims. In the light of that evidence, we had a duty to find a system that spared the victim that additional trauma. The consequent reduction in legal costs is an added bonus, as those costs can be used to pay compensation, rather than to pay lawyers. They amount to approximately £5 million out of a total budget of £45 million to £48 million a year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I press the Minister for further useful clarification. Recourse to the law is taken when an individual believes that he is being unfairly treated by the system. Although the proportion of people in that situation is small, does the Minister accept that many people believe that it is especially important for that small group to have access to legal recourse, without which they do not, in effect, have access to full representation, which they believe is natural justice?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is arguing that the system that has operated successfully in Great Britain for five years is an affront to natural justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not saying that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is not saying that, and we are going to introduce the system in Northern Ireland. I do not think that a trip on the ferry from Great Britain to Northern Ireland makes the system here an affront to natural justice over there. The standards of natural justice in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are the same. Unless the operation of the system in this country is an affront to natural justice, there is no reason to believe that the system will be such an affront when it is translated to Northern Ireland. It is clear that the system in Northern Ireland takes a long time, generates a lot of trauma for people who are involved in it, costs £5 million a year, and produces 14,000 cases, 109 of which are decided in favour of the applicant after the full panoply of the judicial process that involves lawyers at all levels, including barristers and solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also a lawyer, as most members of the Committee know. The legal profession has made a significant contribution to the development of the value of claims. The calculation does not need to be made in the context of a criminal injuries compensation scheme. Figures and elements of claims can always be argued about in civil litigation, and that is what has happened over the years. One has fertilised the other, and they continue to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0564">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
As a Minister and a lawyer, I have a responsibility to pursue a system that is fair to people and addresses the issues that were revealed by a Government review, transparent, speeds up and increases the payment of compensation to victims and spares them trauma. We should also be able to widen significantly eligibility for the scheme. I am not suggesting that it will be perfect, but no one says that the status quo is perfect. I object to screeds of evidence that misrepresent what is being done and suggest that the scheme was designed to save money, when it was designed to respond to the needs of victims. I object to evidence being dressed up to make that argument seem respectable when it is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also pertinent that the review recommended the continuance of court involvement for the only reason that in the political climate of Northern Ireland that prevailed at the time of the publication of the report, it was a bridge too far to replace the independence of the judiciary by a body, although independent in function, that was appointed by the Executive. Almost three years later, there is no longer a valid reason to accept that argument and there is much to be said for adopting a process that will bring greater advantage to many victims of criminal violence, mostly, one would hope, as a result of non-terrorist violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That overall ease of process has convinced us that there is no longer any real need to include in any part of the scheme payment of legal costs in successful cases. People do not need to hire a solicitor to access social security benefits; we want to make access to compensation equally straightforward. Every year some £7 million of public money pays the legal and other costs of some £40 million in compensation payments. That is a significant amount of money that could be better spent in other ways. The draft proposals therefore do two things. They earmark additional funding for Victim Support Northern Ireland to provide support and assistance to any applicants who want help in accessing the compensation scheme and progressing their application, and they widen the eligibility criteria to allow even more victims to benefit from compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I draw the Minister's attention to a criticism highlighted by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission which, without criticising Victim Support Northern Ireland itself, drew attention to the fact that the people who work there are
	<br><q><p>"primarily volunteers without specific legal expertise to address what remain complex criteria for an award to be made. The Commission would wish representation and the giving of advice to victims to be given by the legal profession."</p></q>
Could the Minister comment on that apparent criticism of the expertise that may be available to Victim Support Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am obliged to the hon. Lady for reminding me of that. The criticism appears to be that the people in Victim Support Northern Ireland who offer advice are not lawyers. I could have said that in one sentence. They are not, but the whole purpose of the scheme is to enable people to access their right to compensation without having to employ lawyers. It would be an admission of failure if we said that people would need a lawyer to access the scheme. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Government argue that the scheme will be so simple and straightforward that people will not need to engage lawyers. Indeed, if we discover over time that they do, when that has not happened in Great Britain, we will have failed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has made some valuable suggestions. It essentially said that even trained volunteers in Victim Support Northern Ireland would not be able to operate the scheme as it operates at present. I agree with that. As I understand it, even trained lawyers are having difficulty operating it because there is such dispute about certain things. We have set aside a significant amount of money for the training of victim support volunteers so that they can be trained to the highest standard to provide the level of advice that will be necessary. The added advantage is that because they are being paid from money that we are providing to the organisation, we are expanding and improving the skills of the organisation, but we are also not taking significantly from the fund that can be used to compensate individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Widening eligibility represents a marked improvement to the scheme. No longer will an applicant have to be present at an incident if mental illness occurs as a result of a violent crime committed against a loved one. That is the aspect of the present criminal injuries and compensation scheme about which I probably receive the most correspondence. People tell me that they are no less the victim of an incident because they only heard about it second hand and its effect can be as serious and sometimes more serious. If they had been there, they would have been able to see the extent of the injury and kept it in some perspective. We are responding to a growing public demand from the public and elected representatives to address that perceived injustice. Professional rescuers will not be left out of the loop either if they suffer mental illness as a result of believing that a loved one has been injured or killed in an incident in which they are involved in their professional capacity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Bereavement awards will be replaced by bereavement support payments, which provide a formal recognition of the grief and suffering of the close relatives of a murder victim. The quantum of such payments will be higher than the current bereavement awards, and will be made available to a much wider group. Unlike under the present system, cases may be reopened after a final settlement if there has been such a material change in the victim's medical condition as a consequence of the injury that injustice would occur if the original assessment were allowed to stand.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the current statutory absolute time limit of three years will be abolished and a new two-year flexible limit will be imposed. That means that claims should be made within two years of the date of the incident—a not unreasonable expectation in most cases—but in exceptional circumstances cases can be considered at any time after the two-year limit if it is reasonable and in the interests of justice to do so. In
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0565">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
short, we have reduced the time limit but greatly increased the flexibility of the circumstances in which that time limit will be relaxed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This should make a huge difference to many who would have lost out under the current law. In particular, it should make it possible for claims to be made by victims of childhood sexual abuse who, for very understandable reasons, have not been able to pursue the dreadful crimes committed against them as children until well into adulthood. The current system of an inflexible three-year limit has operated to the detriment of such people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately the proposed new arrangements would not help existing victims of child sexual abuse who have failed to meet the current strict time limit. As a result the Government have, after lengthy consideration, taken an almost unprecedented step. We have inserted into the proposed scheme a provision that will operate retrospectively and enable those victims of child sexual abuse, whose claims would have been disallowed under the current statute, an opportunity to submit a fresh claim under the terms of the new scheme. That is despite the fact that the incidents in question took place prior to the date of the introduction of the new arrangements. Such a move only serves to emphasise the Government's commitment to creating a better deal for some of the most deserving victims in our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A significant number of those people have in the past applied and been refused under the existing arrangements. They are known to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. We undertake to contact them so that they can take advantage of this window of opportunity to have their retrospective claims dealt with. The gross injustice that the strict rules have done to a significant number of the most vulnerable people in our society can at last be redressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without any help from my advisers, I can equivocally tell the hon. Gentleman yes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have also had to pay due regard to the more recent evolving political developments. As we look to the future in terms both of political stability and diminishing levels of violence and unrest, so we have looked ahead with the proposed arrangements for paying compensation. This is a statutory framework that we hope will govern compensation for crimes that will not include the equivalents of the horrors of Omagh, the carnage of the Shankill road bomb, the multiple killings or isolated murders of victims be they civilians or security force personnel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Already, the figures show a marked decrease in the ratio of terrorist-related to non-terrorist injuries from 29 per cent. in 1992–93 to 8 per cent. in 1998–99. Terrorist-related awards have been, on average, twice the value of non-terrorist awards, reflecting the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
severity of the injuries sustained. Much of what we expect to deal with in the future will be the victims of Saturday night brawls, the victims of domestic violence, and the victims of general thuggery. Those cases are traumatic and terrible for victims but, with respect, they are nothing like the consequences meted out on people by terrorist atrocities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have removed the ban on compensation for those with terrorist connections. From 1 April 2002, all unspent criminal convictions—scheduled or otherwise—will be treated in the same way in assessing entitlement to compensation for an injury. Those changes are made with the best interests of the victim at heart. There is no other reason underlying the proposals. The changes are not made to cut levels of compensation or to reduce the compensation budget. They have their origins in providing a better deal for victims, and I have a clear conscience that that is precisely what they will do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals have been examined by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, which raised a number of issues. We are grateful for its response and the concerns expressed are being considered. However, the proposed scheme is based on one that has been running for five years in Great Britain and has not yet been challenged. Nevertheless, we do not rely solely on that. We have undertaken a separate exercise and our lawyers are satisfied that the scheme in Northern Ireland complies with the Human Rights Act 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My response to the hon. Lady may be shorter than her question. She raises the nub of the commission's argument that we have failed to meet the necessary standards on human rights. We undertook a separate exercise and took separate legal advice. The hon. Lady will be aware that lawyers do not always agree on human rights matters, which are not always amenable to specific definition. We went to significant lengths to ensure that we met those objectives in devising the scheme. We achieved transparency, efficiency and

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
accuracy, and balanced that with the individual circumstances of applicants. I am reinforced in that view by the independent legal advice that I have received. I am happy to debate with the commission its alternative view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dodds</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has stressed that the proposal is not motivated by a desire to cut down on the compensation bill.

The Government believe that the proposed scheme takes account of equality issues and that it will not have an adverse impact on section 75 groups. An equality impact assessment is being prepared and will be published in due course. We have had no representations on equality matters in the proposed legislation from any organisations acting for the groups concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the Compensation Agency staff, who have been responsible for delivering the service denned by the legislative framework throughout the years of civil unrest and since. That standard of service was recently recognised when they were awarded a charter mark for the third time. The agency's objective has always been to ensure that everyone who was eligible received full and fair compensation for their injuries. The administration of the changes that I have outlined will fall squarely on its shoulders. I am sure that members of the Committee will join me in concluding that the agency will rise to the challenge that has been set.

I generally welcome the measure before the Committee. His speech will stand as an eloquent testimony to the effectiveness of the tariff scheme that was introduced in Great Britain in 1996. I thank the Minister for endorsing the measure introduced by the previous Conservative Government. I do not want to delay the Committee too long, so I shall confine my remarks to one or two essential points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basic principles of simplicity, straightforwardness and a much quicker system are obviously to be welcomed. I want to illustrate that with
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
my first experience as a troop leader. In 1980 I inspected a troop under my command that was arriving in the Army. A soldier in the troop had been blown up by a bomb in Kinawley in 1978 and had suffered a substantial loss of hearing. I served in the Army until 1990, and it took most of my time there before he could secure compensation under the scheme as it then stood. That case illustrates all the agonies that a victim goes through, trying to understand the system and get some idea of when to expect payment and the level of payment, which is why I thoroughly welcome the general direction of the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted that the Minister said that he was suspicious of the level of knowledge of the Northern Ireland Assembly, because of its report and recommendations. It is worth reiterating the purpose of compensation. Howard Webber, the chief executive of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, talked about the case of Lisa Potts, which gave rise to considerable controversy on the mainland because of the relative lack of compensation that she received compared with the compensation that had been paid in other cases. For example, Marco Pierre White was awarded £100,000 after his food was described as containing black ink instead of squid ink. Other examples will readily spring to hon. Members' minds. Mr. Webber said:
	<br><q><p>"Lisa Potts's case highlights that no amount of money can make up for the suffering caused by such horrific events. It cannot reward her for the heroism she showed. But £50,000 can provide real help for people to rebuild their lives. The scheme lets society show its sympathy for victims and recognise their suffering. You cannot compare it with awards in the courts where a guilty party compensates the victim."</p></q>
The principles enunciated by the Minister on the role of the state in that process are absolutely valid. Access to justice is extremely important. The Minister spoke to us as a lawyer, hoping to reduce the amount of work given to his colleagues, who currently earn £5 million from the administration of the system. I do not suppose that his colleagues are too unhappy with the work that they have received from the Government in regard to Northern Ireland; the inquiry into Bloody Sunday is rolling along at a cost of about £20 million a year. Lawyers seem to have done rather well out of the overall arrangements. The reduction in the amount of money that they will receive under the scheme is welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take issue with the hon. Gentleman's claim that there is a new age in Northern Ireland in terms of the effect of terrorist offences. Despite a ceasefire and the Belfast agreement, the level of terrorist violence in Northern Ireland remains appallingly high. As the Government have put on the record, the number of cases being cleared up by the police has dropped catastrophically over the past year, which is a reflection of the demoralisation of the police service in Northern Ireland that has occurred over the past few years under the Govt. As a consequence of that, fewer victims will be able to seek compensation directly from their assailant because no assailant has been identified and convicted by the police. They will be able to rely only on the scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
I commend the work of the Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly in looking into the matter although, like the Minister, I do not agree with the general thrust of its conclusions, particularly its main recommendation that this system of compensation should not be introduced into Northern Ireland. Recommendation 8, which I support, states that
	<br><q><p>"the Secretary of State should not, in determining an award, have regard to any payments made in respect of private healthcare or those received out of private health insurance."</p></q>
As I understand it—I should be grateful if the Minister would address the matter—that recommendation contradicts paragraph 45 (c) of the draft scheme. Not only do the Government intend to take into account payments made under private insurance undertaken by people but, as the draft proposal goes on:
	<br><q><p>"In assessing the value of any such benefits and payments, account may be taken of any income tax liability likely to reduce their value."</p></q>
That seems extremely unfair. One could be in the extraordinary position of being worse off if one has taken care of oneself and taken out additional insurance from taxed income. Such people would then find that their benefit is taxed, with the Government not even agreeing to reduce the amount of compensation that they will pay by the full amount but deciding only whether they will reimburse people fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a gross unfairness in the system. If one is to have a tariff scheme that applies across the piece, it must genuinely do so. Decisions that people then take about insurance are matters for them. The scheme does not attempt to compensate people fully for the injuries that they have received. If it did, we would be back into the old scheme of people going to common law, with the state accepting liability. As the Minister made it clear earlier, the state does not accept liability for compensation. Therefore, it is not right to penalise people who provide for their own insurance—who, indeed, may be paying two or three times over by having such insurance—to ensure that some of the compensation that they receive is outwith the state. Such people should not be seen as putting a burden on the national health service; they have effectively put extra resources into health care generally, out of their own taxed income. The Minister said that any benefits that they receive should be discounted from the scheme. That is not fair and I support the conclusions of the Assembly ad hoc Committee that examined the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I shall discuss eligibility. The Minister said that we were moving into a new era and that the automatic disqualification that applied to a certain class of offences should, therefore, go. I listened with care to my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) and I accept that there must be a degree of flexibility. If people have changed their ways and renewed their commitment to civil society as we understand it, then that should be taken into account. I would support rules on eligibility that give the Minister discretion to make those judgments himself,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
but I caution him that our experience of Government judgments on such matters means that we will be watching with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say that in the light of the Government motion, for which the Minister will vote on Tuesday, to stuff another £400,000 a year down the throats of provisional Sinn Fein for office costs allowances. If there is any suggestion that the Minister is not exercising the discretion that this Committee and the House would expect in decisions about people who have been exposed to terrorism, so have brought misfortune upon themselves, and who would be automatically disqualified under the current scheme, obviously we would want to revisit the question of automatic disqualification in another debate. I am sure that the Minister will be able to give the Committee the assurances that it wants.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.36 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Eddie McGrady 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate the Minister and the Government on introducing the proposals and on the manner in which they have dealt with such a difficult and sensitive subject. Time is short, considering the number of participants who wish to speak, so I shall be brief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the Minister's opening statement, he spoke about his suspicion at the level of knowledge in the Northern Ireland Assembly on the subject. I confirm that suspicion—I have little knowledge of the intricacies of the legal processes. However, that does not deny the fact that the Assembly Committee that examined the proposed legislation was not only cross party, but crossed professional experiences. Members had not just legal, but practical experiences, and in my opinion a practical approach is often far superior to a legal one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome several factors of the proposed draft. The obvious ones are the extension and enhancement of the bereavement support payment and the new concept of cohabitual applicants with a two-year period for establishing reasonable conditions. I welcome the removal of restrictions on the compensatory process for psychological injuries, in particular the opening up of retrospective time limits for sex abuse claims. They are an acceptable and welcome initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is the duty of every political party, including mine, to make points of criticism not for its own sake, but to help improve the proposals and make a better system. The hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon) commented on the overemphasis of Victim Support Northern Ireland volunteers. They need some additional latitude in terms of legal assistance. The other matter that requires some definition is the extent to which legal aid will be provided for claimants under the proposed legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have great sympathy for the view expressed by the hon. Member for East Antrim on historical criminal records and the extent to which they would be used to prevent compensation from being paid. The Minister did not adequately address that issue in response to the intervention. Allied to that is the transfer from the remit of the judiciary to the remit of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0568">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
administration, certain decision-making processes, giving the Secretary of State powers to make such decisions. That also appears in another area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I now want to comment on the tariff system. It is in great dispute, especially the element of the first 28 weeks, a period during which a person will not be compensated. I heard the Minister talk about a percentage loading. I am not certain whether he spoke of 1.8 per cent. or 18 per cent., but whatever the loading, it does not address the differential loss for that 28-week period because a person's earning capability varies considerably and the consequential loss varies considerably. That cannot be addressed by a fixed, across-the-board percentage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Particular to the tariff system is the way it addresses a sliding scale of values for injuries and for suffering. That is a retrograde step because each person suffers individually and differently. Some are more resilient than others and some are less physically fit than others. To have a blanket, scaled amount of compensation for the lesser claims outwardly appears to be unjust. There seems to be a body of opinion, not particularly this afternoon, that says consequentially there will be a reduction in the amounts of compensation paid in this area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Committee suspended for a Division in the House.</i></p>
	<p>3.57 pm</p>
	<p>	<i>On resuming</i>—</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The various concerns that we are trying to express are broadly reflected by the concerns expressed by the all-party ad hoc Committee in the Northern Ireland Assembly. There was a general consensus of lay and legal advice from members of that Committee that the proposals suggested a reduction in the funds and compensation paid to individuals. Rightly or wrongly, that has been translated as a cost-cutting exercise. I am prepared to accept the Minister's assurances that it is not; nevertheless, if that is the effect of the legislation, that will be seen as its purpose.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also ask the Minister to take on board the concern expressed by the Human Rights Commission that the process may be flawed under the Human Rights Act 1998. I know that he has received a report from the Human Rights Commission on those issues. Many hon. Members have referred to a deficit exercise of the Assembly. The report of the ad hoc Committee, which was representative of all the parties in Northern Ireland—as it has to be, by statute—was brought to the Floor of the Assembly and received unanimous support from all 10 parties. The bottom line of the report was straightforward; the proposed legislation should not be introduced in its current form, and the Minister should take cognisance of the proposal's many deficits, as listed by law societies, the Assembly and the Human Rights Commission, and in other representations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To what extent is the Minister prepared to consult on those representations, and to what extent is he prepared to argue his case on each main item of controversy before he introduces the legislation next
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
year? The people of Northern Ireland have unanimously articulated their concerns through their public representatives; therefore, the Government are duty bound to take on board the comments or provide alternative evidence that the criticisms are not justified.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Lady Hermon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I intend to keep my contribution short, Mr. McWilliam. Your patience been tested, but the Minister has kindly responded in full to every intervention. I appreciate that level of exchange.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like formally to record our thanks to the members of the review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme in Northern Ireland: Professor Des Greer, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield and Mrs. Marion Gibson. Each of them brought to the Committee considerable expertise and great diligence. In a previous incarnation, I knew Professor Greer from the law faculty. I recall consulting him about a short paper; he sent back 60 pages of comments, which I carefully filed away. He is meticulous in his examination of records.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the firm conclusions of the review team stated
	<br><q><p>"that a total severance from the common law basis which has underpinned the system for so many years would not be justified. Instead, we have looked for a way of distinguishing between injuries likely to have a substantial and often lifelong effect upon the victim and other injuries which, although unpleasant, are less serious. For this less serious category of cases we would wish to see a simpler and speedier system which does not involve substantial legal costs."</p></q>
Given the calibre of the people on the review team, I would be slow to move away from their recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate the comments of the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady), who is a constituency neighbour. He drew attention to the report on the proposal by the ad hoc Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Eleven members in the Assembly reached a cross-party conclusion that they did not want the legislation to be introduced in its present form; we should be slow to move from that recommendation, as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister addressed many of the issues this afternoon, and I have appreciated his explanations, which help to address many of the queries that were raised by the Assembly Committee. The one outstanding issue to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention is the deep concern felt by the Law Society of Northern Ireland. In the very recent issue of its journal, 	<i>The Writ</i>, the society's president, Mr. John Neill, commented critically:
	<br><q><p>"Unfortunately, the Government has shown no willingness to date to engage in a meaningful dialogue with the Society, and indeed has given every signal that non-negotiable decisions have
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0569">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
been made, and that the consultation exercise is a meaningless formality. The message to the Government from almost all consultees and now the Assembly is clear. We hope that the Government will listen to the voice of the Assembly"</p></q>
and
	<br><q><p>"think again".</p></q>
I should like the Minister to reassure us that the Law Society of Northern Ireland is among those who have been consulted. I am not a member of that society, but a criticism is being circulated in the legal profession in Northern Ireland. If it has a genuine concern that it has not been consulted and a genuine sense of grievance, such criticism of a Government proposal does none of us any good. I hope that the Minister takes that on board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's introductory clarifications were impressive, and I am grateful that he took the time to explain the order's contents. I was quite dubious about it before I came to the Committee, but some answers that he gave genuinely struck a chord, for which I thank him. That shows that it has been sensible for the Minister to bring the issue to a Committee for discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As has been said, we are trying to equate human suffering with money, which is very hard to do. Indeed, it is virtually impossible in many ways. The hon. Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt) made points about that, which I need not repeat. We all understand that by the time the order kicks in, something bad will already have happened. We are talking about trying to alleviate the consequences of harm, rather than trying to prevent it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context, the order has clearly been designed with the right intent. Simplifying procedures is evidently a good idea, and to attempt some form of codification probably makes sense, too. Providing flexibility, which means that the measure extends to individuals who may not have been able to access such compensation previously, is also sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred to victims of child abuse who may be encouraged to come forward as a result of the order, not so much for the money as for the support that they need finally to put to rest something that has blighted their lives, perhaps for many years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to raise two points from the submission of the Human Rights Commission, the first relating to paragraphs 38 and 39. The scheme introduces a bereavement support payment. It seems that same-sex couples and heterosexual cohabitees who apply for such payments must show that they had lived with the victim who died for two years before their death. Spouses of the victim, however, do not seem to have to overcome that hurdle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister clarify whether the commission's understanding is correct? Do the Government intend to distinguish between spouses, and same-sex couples and heterosexual cohabitees? It is important to be clear on that point, because it could have a profound impact on individuals who had chosen a slightly different lifestyle but suffered the same bereavement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
The commission suggests that that provision might be subject to challenge under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998, but the Minister has assured us that that is not the case. I should welcome comments on that point, but I am primarily interested in the Government's thinking and whether they are willing seriously to consider including the groups that I described. Either now or at some point after the Committee, I should be grateful for a response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question of equal treatment has been raised. The scheme seems to treat those who have a criminal record less favourably than blameless victims. I was persuaded by the commission's argument that that might contravene sections 6 and 7 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Will the Minister comment on whether the Government intend that distinction to stand, and if so, do they feel that it is in line with natural justice?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Down made an important point, and it is clear where the Assembly stands on a cross-party basis. Although I do not agree with some of the Assembly's recommendations, a consequence of devolution is that one should recognise the view of devolved assemblies even when it does not coincide with the Government's. Does the Minister intend to debate formally or adopt the recommendations? What is the relationship between the Assembly and the Government in determining the influence of devolution on the legislation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where there are human beings, there will be crime, so an order of this nature is inevitable. Nevertheless, the greatest achievement would be prevention rather than compensation. We should recognise that no amount of money will compensate the relative of a victim who has been lost, or an individual harmed. Our greatest challenge is to continue to secure peace in Northern Ireland's politics and its communities. That is our highest priority.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.12 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's earlier response. Will he outline the changes he will make to the legislation as a result of the Northern Ireland Assembly's report? If no changes were made, it would confirm that "Government consultation" was merely eyewash. They are ready to consult but they will not make changes, even if the Assembly proposes something useful. Successive Governments have talked of consultation but made no significant changes afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A particular class of victim has not been noted. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit O£pik) referred to peace continuing in Northern Ireland. We live in the real world. I am not talking about terrorism, but normal criminal activity; trespassing, burglary in homes and robbery. Recently, a lady wrote to me from a working-class area in my constituency. Time and again, her home has been broken into. She paid increasing insurance costs, but has received no compensation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In another case, a person delivering freebies—local papers—put her hand in the door, and claimed that the letterbox snapped on it. She claimed for compensation
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0570">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
and obtained legal aid. My constituents who asked about legal aid were told that they would have to pay £800 for a solicitor to represent them. The one who had legal aid to pursue her claim withdrew it, but my constituents were left having paid £800 for nothing. Who are the victims? Is it those who get themselves involved, use legal aid to present their case and then withdraw? Or those who use legal aid to win the case, and the real victim has to pay out again? That is an aspect that we must review again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was happy enough with the Minster's answer concerning the Law Society report because I believe it is important that those involved in victim support get training and assistance. I often discover, however, that lawyers act specifically within legal frameworks. It was rather interesting, this week, to discover two distinguished people from the legal profession being summoned, and having damages found against them, for having given the wrong guidance on a medical negligence case. In relation to a young person and a life-threatening problem, they advised that it was only possible to receive £50,000. Now, apparently, millions may be involved. However, those two have gone to the top of their particular profession. Sometimes those who work with victims at least come to the matter with an understanding of what victims are suffering, rather than dealing strictly with the legal aspect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is why I welcomed the Minister's assurance about those who applied under the previous scheme, were turned down, took it to the court and were turned down on the strict legal interpretation. I am thinking of a man who, years after completing his sentence, was out one evening with his mate, engaged in innocent activity. In a random shooting, this man and his friend were both injured. His friend was grazed and got compensation. The man, however, is now a paraplegic but received no compensation because—as my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim was alluding—in years past he had been involved in terrorist activity from which he had turned after serving his sentence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not believe in double jeopardy. If he had been continuing or had again been involved in unlawful activity, I could have understood his criminal background being brought to the attention of the Compensation Agency and for them to have acted accordingly. It seems important to bear in mind that once a person has discharged their debt to society, the matter should not be brought up again unless they have been re-offending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 28 June 2001, the Minister said—according to the report from the Northern Ireland Assembly—that one of the two features of the new arrangement was a removal of specific terrorist exclusion provisions. I am not convinced that we are actually finished with terrorism in Northern Ireland. Does the Minister think that criminal activities cover terrorist activities?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Nigel Dodds 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister spoke at considerable length in attempting to clarify a number of issues to the Committee. We welcome the fact that a number of proposals in the order are very helpful in assisting victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
The bereavement support payment that has been given in recognition of the grief and sorrow of the family is widely welcomed throughout Northern Ireland, as is the widening criteria for qualifying claimants. It is also very welcome that individuals who were not necessarily at the scene of a crime or terrorist incident are now going to be eligible to make an application. I wonder to what extent it may have helped in the situation of Mrs. Rita Restorick, the mother of the last soldier killed in Northern Ireland, a case that has had some recent publicity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We know of cases in our own constituencies of people who have suffered great mental anguish as a result of a crime at which they were not necessarily present but which has had an effect on them. I also welcome the flexibility that has been built in for those who may have a criminal record and have been involved in violence, but whose injury is caused not as a result of that. A new leaf has been turned in many cases. That flexibility is welcome, as is its potential to reopen cases, especially of child sex abuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have concerns, some of which were highlighted in the Assembly's ad hoc Committee report. The Assembly was asked for its views, and came to a unanimous conclusion in Committee, which was unanimously endorsed on the floor of the Assembly. The Government must accept those views and meet the recommendations through further consultation and feedback, rather than dismiss them. Further consultation may be necessary, as recommended by the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The introduction of the tariff scheme is a major concern. Individual pain and suffering must be compensated on an individual basis. The Minister mentioned the 28-week period of loss of earnings for which compensation would not be payable. The Minister explained that the Government considered all cases, came to a general conclusion and applied a fixed figure. That will not take into account individual losses. Compensation is about returning people to the position they were in before the injury occurred.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tariff scheme is applied across the board, which was not recommended by the Bloomfield review. It did not suggest that such a scheme should apply only to more serious injuries. I share the concern of Sir Kenneth Bloomfield that no one sum of money can compensate an individual for the pain and suffering that he or she has endured as a result of an injury; it has to be considered according to the individual's circumstances. The tariff system does not do that. For example, a facial injury may not be of a serious nature as defined by the order, but it would be of serious consequence to a young lady; more so than for an elderly person. A fixed sum in that sort of case would not take account of individual circumstances. For minor injuries to qualify, a victim must sustain three such injuries. What is the rationale behind that requirement?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The removal of paid legal advice is wrong. People have spoken eloquently about the role of Victim Support Northern Ireland. However, to install that

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
organisation, in place of qualified legal practitioners, as the main player advocating on behalf of compensation claimants—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Browne</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Dodds</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary indicates that that is not the case. However, if people want legal advice, they will have to pay for it. That is not an option for the vast majority of claimants; they cannot pay for independent legal advice. The Law Society and others recognise that. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission stated that it was concerned that those who worked with victim support in Northern Ireland are primarily volunteers without legal experience. The commission wants the legal profession to represent and give advice to victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third area of concern is the removal of the right of appeal to the courts, which is in direct contravention of the recommendation of the Bloomfield review. I have heard no satisfactory explanation of why that right of appeal has been removed. The Human Rights Commission opposed its removal in its submission to the NI Assembly Committee. Bloomfield himself, in his conclusions, argued against the removal of the right of appeal to the county court. That should be looked at.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has said several times—he doth protest too much, methinks—that expenditure is not quite being reduced. Several submissions were made to the Assembly Committee in which that issue arose. I would be interested to know what the final saving would be. It is not just a question of saving money on legal costs. Under the proposals, less money will go to victims. That is the bottom line and we should assess the order on whether victims will be better off. In many cases, victims will be able to apply for compensation only through the scheme; the civil remedy is not open to them since no one can identify the perpetrator of the crime. If they were able to pursue a civil case, the amount of damages would be far greater under the "Green Book" that lawyers and judges use.

Our discussion augurs well for the debate on the draft order and gives us a good grounding for an informed and detailed discussion. We will return to several of the issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
It has been my position from the outset that the recommendations grew out of a genuine desire to reflect the concerns of the victims of crime and to listen to what they had to say. Bloomfield started the ball rolling and I continue to run with it by listening to all that has been said today. Hon. Members must understand that the debate itself is part of the consultation process. We discuss orders of this nature in Committee as part of a consultation and listening process. We are still in that mode. I have to say in my defence—I hope that hon. Members will agree—that while I may not have listened to everything that has been said to me on legislation brought before the House, I have a track record of responding to suggestions and taking on board sensible recommendations. I am not gaining a reputation as someone who consults on a sham basis and does not listen. My record over a comparatively short period demonstrates the contrary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our debate reflects only a fraction of the consultation that has taken place on the proposals. The review team listened to victims and consulted widely; the proposals reflect that consultation. We have listened to the concerns, but I must have time to consider the observations that have been made. The Law Society of Northern Ireland entered its submission into the consultation at the last minute, and I have not yet had time to consider its observations and recommendations. However, all submissions will be considered. Where I have not been able to consider individual issues, I will write to hon. Members to help them to debate these matters with me again in the draft order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force document "Northern Ireland Threat Assessment 2001" states that:
	<br><q><p>"just over half of groups involved in drug dealing throughout Northern Ireland are believed to have paramilitary associations."</p></q>
I will give an example of the size of the threat. The document states:
	<br><q><p>"In the period 1 January 2000 to 30 November 2000, the RUC seized drugs worth £10.5 million. There has been a consistent rise in the amount of ecstasy seized in recent years, and a more significant rise in heroin seized in the last year. Just under half of the organised crime groups identified are listed as having drug dealing or trafficking as their predominant criminal activity. There is a marked difference between regions with 59 per cent. of groups in Belfast engaging primarily in drug-related activity compared with 40 per cent. in North and 33 per cent. in South. Dealing is far more widespread than trafficking. Whilst just over half of groups

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
involved in drug dealing throughout Northern Ireland are believed to have paramilitary association, it remains difficult to prove paramilitary-directed involvement."</p></q>
I hope to answer that question in my concluding remarks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Northern Ireland newspaper that politicians sometimes read with trepidation is 	<i>The Sunday World</i>, which is edited by a strong character called Jim McDowell who is known to most of us. He recently gave an interview about a book he had just written called "Godfathers", and he referred to chapter 20, which is entitled "The Drugs Buster". The drugs buster is Superintendent Kevin Sheehy of the RUC. McDowell wrote:
	<br><q><p>"One of Sheehy's most outstanding contributions to the police service, and to the community in Northern Ireland, was when he headed up the RUC's Drugs Squad based at the Antrim Road barracks in North Belfast."</p></q>
Sheehy predicted a new "terror war" waged by drugs gangs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The book also contains a revealing interview with Sheehy who is now retired. He took the Patten compensation package, as many senior officers have, and lost the RUC an experienced officer. He told McDowell that the drugs problem exploded in Northern Ireland about eight years ago. McDowell asked him if the paramilitaries had been in at the start of the drugs revolution. He told him that there was a major difference between the two groups.
	<br><q><p>"The Provos knew that this peace process was coming, and they knew that image was all-important, particularly with the Americans.</p></q>
	<br><q><p>They knew what the Americans were like with drugs. So the Provos were very, very clear that their activities weren't going to be allowed to be involved in drugs trafficking. Instead they engaged, or allowed, non-members to be drugs traffickers in West Belfast, Derry, Newry and so on and they agreed to take a percentage of the profits."</p></q>
So when we read the provos' propaganda that they have killed a drugs dealer, they are not wiping out drugs dealing, but are killing a drugs dealer because he has not paid the 50 per cent. commission. The so-called loyalist paramilitaries are not quite as sophisticated or as clever as the provos. Sheehy says that Protestant paramilitaries, the UVF and UDA in particular, do not have so many concerns about image and have long been involved in gangsterism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the interview, Sheehy breaks down the involvement, but before I quote again, I should list the organisations involved. The Provisional IRA, on so-called terrorist ceasefire, and the Official IRA, an organisation that we do not hear much about now, are up to their necks in gansterism and drug-dealing, the latter especially in South Down and around Newry—the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) has left the Committee, but he will know about that. The UDA, LVF, UVF and the many associated paramilitary organisations of which the Minister will be well aware are also all up to their necks in drug dealing. I urge the Minister to read the book by Jim McDowell and the interview with Sheehy. He should also talk to Sheehy, even though he is retired, and the officers of the drug squad to evaluate the size of the threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
The connections to paramilitary organisations come through in the United Kingdom, especially in Stranraer and Liverpool, which are two of the main trafficking centres. The heroin trade runs through Stranraer, and I will return to that subject. Many of the harder drugs come through Dublin and over the border. Loyalist and republican paramilitary organisations deal together in the import of drugs into Ireland to Dublin and through Belfast and Larne. The main links with the criminal fraternity are in Liverpool, Glasgow and Manchester. Heroin has become a serious threat, and my hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) has a major problem with the large working-class Protestant estates of Ballymena, the heroin capital of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was in Washington last weekend to talk to members of the Administration. I spoke an expert on Afghanistan, who told me that the State Department believes that Afghanistan, where we are fighting a war against terrorism, supplies 80 per cent. of the world's heroin. We are on the receiving end, not only in Northern Ireland, but in the whole of the United Kingdom. The international network of terrorism runs from the provos who were established in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has a spaghetti connection dealing in drugs throughout the world. There are links to the Palestine Liberation Organisation and its sister groups in both Syria and Iraq, ETA and, most importantly, in Cuba. The Cuban provo representative was not on holiday in Columbia when he was arrested, but supplying urban terrorist training in exchange for money that comes from dealing heavy drugs directly into the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Drug dealers in the loyalist paramilitaries and those orchestrated by the provos are destroying large sections of society in Northern Ireland. Drugs are rampant throughout all the major working-class estates, which are now policed by the IRA, the Official IRA—especially in parts of South Down—the UVF and the UDA. When I was at school, far too long ago in the late 1960s, we did not see such involvement of hard drugs at every level of society in Northern Ireland. They are being sold in the estates to young people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the initiative taken in February 2001 by the Minister's predecessor, the now Minister of State for Defence, with the rehabilitation schemes at the two RUC stations in Strandtown and Waterside. That applied to only two areas, and I believe that the Minister allocated £258,000. As the trial period comes to an end, I hope that he will consider whether the rehabilitation scheme, which is designed to stop drug-related crime, could be applied more widely, as it is on the mainland, to many more police stations in Northern Ireland, as that is one way of dealing with rehabilitation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rehabilitation is one aspect, but there is only one way to deal with the problem. I said that I would outline the problem, but I do not like to do so without offering a solution. The Italians have successfully implemented a solution in their fight against organised crime and the best known of the crime organisations,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0573">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
the mafia. The mafia is related to all worldwide terrorist organisations involved in drugs. The Italians have been able to deal with the mafia in recent years because they have made phone tap evidence admissible in courts of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should examine the Italian example and its success rates. No one believed that the Italian Government would deal with mafia crime and terrorism. That, more than any other measure initiated in Italy, has allowed the Italian Government and Italian society to eat into the strength of their mafia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All drug dealing is done on phones and mobile phones. Drug dealers are in every part of society. They are getting drugs in and doing drops in every part of Northern Ireland, and at clubs and raves throughout Northern Ireland and the whole of Ireland and here on the mainland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>David Burnside</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Arguments about demand can be approached in different ways. Pricing is one way of affecting demand.

Members who represent Northern Ireland will know the places in their constituencies where drugs can be purchased. I could take the Committee to a pub in east Belfast where everyone knows that paramilitary organisations sell drugs. If everyone in the area knows, so do the police. Will the hon. Gentleman give us his opinion of why, when the police must be aware that drugs are being sold on the premises, no prosecutions are brought against members of that paramilitary organisation? Is there are view on the part of the Government and those in the police service that they are better doing that than being involved in other paramilitary activity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>David Burnside</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The behind-the-scenes approval of paramilitaries for the "political" process, or peace process, as it is more widely known, is because that is being allowed. In the example that I gave of the Official IRA in South Down, that is being allowed to take place. Many people in South Down wonder why the police do not act against the Official IRA, which is supposedly on a longer ceasefire than the so-called tactical presence ceasefire of the Provisional IRA. What approval do the police give? Sheehy and officers like him do their lot, but recently, since the beginning of the peace process, a blind eye seems to have been turned to such paramilitary activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have support from the DUP and the SDLP, but I do not expect any support from the front organisations of terrorism, Sinn Fein or the loyalist paramilitaries. I would not expect or want it. We must deal with the paramilitaries and the drug dealers. We need all-party support, which exists among the democratic parties in Northern Ireland, for legislation to put the drug dealers out of business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Jane Kennedy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Mr. McWilliam, it is a pleasure to be called by you as Chairman. It is some time since I arrived as a new Member and you were chairing the Committee examining the Finance Bill, back in the dark and dismal days when our party was in opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I congratulate the hon. Member for South Antrim (David Burnside) on securing this timely debate. He has argued forcefully, coherently and cogently, and raised many issues that I hope to deal with in my response. I also hope to deal with the points of other hon. Members. The hon. Gentleman majored on the scale of the drugs trade problem in Northern Ireland, and I will not spend too long reiterating his points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will not major on the evils of the drugs trade in Northern Ireland. Those who trade in drugs trade in human misery and deserve absolute condemnation. I want to focus on the scale and the scope of the problem, on how Government and the agencies are tackling the drugs trade, the role of the paramilitaries in peddling drugs and the wider strategic issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the scale of the problem in the rest of the United Kingdom, it is easy to be complacent about the drugs situation in Northern Ireland. Mercifully, the problems that we face there are less acute—particularly compared with those that I have experienced as a Liverpool MP—but therein lies the challenge. We must prevent the growth of the drugs trade, especially in hard drugs, and make in-roads into the supply chain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In Northern Ireland, the drugs problem is compounded by the involvement of the paramilitaries. It is compounded by the fear and intimidation they can bring to bear within a community, and by the paramilitary apparatus that is readily transferable to the organised crime field.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister is approaching the key issue. Drugs sold in Northern Ireland bring double death. Drugs trade profits are ploughed back

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
into paramilitary organisations, crimes against society and destruction in the Province. The Government have to pay for resulting compensation.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jane Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point, but we must retain a balanced view. The threat assessment that the hon. Member for South Antrim referred to earlier stated that half the organised crime groups have paramilitary links, but half do not. In spite of the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that this was not a true and honest assessment and that there were paramilitaries who stepped back from these organisations, there are people who have no involvement with paramilitaries at all. The drug and organised crime scene in Northern Ireland is ever changing, constantly adapting itself to the way in which the law enforcement agencies respond to the challenge. We must always bear that in mind and ensure that we never give refuge to those engaged in that wicked trade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also continue to have a holistic approach to the drugs problem. We must take positive action in the fields of treatment, education and rehabilitation—the kind of projects to which the hon. Gentleman referred. We are constantly increasing our knowledge and understanding of the scale and scope of the drugs problem. The organised crime task force, which I chair, met yesterday. It is providing a focus for a better understanding of the challenge facing the law enforcement agencies. The task force is also fostering a multi-agency approach for tackling drugs-related criminality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Each illicit drug carries with it its own peculiar characteristics and affects society in different ways, but there are common factors such as crime for profit, and willingness by those importing and supplying to protect their market through violent means. The organised crime task force yesterday considered a paper from the police service in Northern Ireland, which is the lead agency on tackling the drugs supply. The paper develops yet further our understanding of the problem and it makes a number of recommendations for improving the collective response.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Belfast, East and for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) expressed doubts about how these organisations operate and the police response to them. The police will act on information if it is provided to them. The hon. Gentleman shakes his head. The police will give no room to people who are actively engaged in dealing in drugs. It is important to remember when we criticise the police service in Northern Ireland that this is an organisation that deserves our absolute respect. Since August 1998, it has intercepted 28 bombs in Northern Ireland, using intelligence gathered in the way that the hon. Gentleman was doubtful about. That includes discoveries as well as interceptions. It manages to continue to protect our society in Northern Ireland and to engage with criminal organisations involved in drug dealing in a way that is worthy of our admiration and respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much of the detail of the report we considered yesterday is sensitive and could compromise intelligence flows and operations if disclosed
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
prematurely, but I can give a flavour of some of the main findings and the action to be taken. A number of key criminals are involved in trafficking drugs into Northern Ireland and a larger number of individuals distribute drugs within Northern Ireland. Many are major organised crime figures. We face problems from a trade in heroin—the hon. Member for South Antrim is right—cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, cannabis and amphetamines. Unlike the rest of the United Kingdom, our drugs market is dominated by the trade in ecstasy and cannabis. An emerging problem is the increase in prescription drug misuse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those involved in both paramilitary activity and the illicit drugs trade are predominately loyalists, but drug-dealing is by no means an exclusive preserve of the loyalist paramilitaries. Republican paramilitaries are involved to an extent. The hon. Member for South Antrim is right. There are also organised crime gangs peddling drugs who have no connection with paramilitary activity. I recognise fully the terrible impact of paramilitary involvement in organised crime, including drugs, but the operational agencies must not focus solely on that at the expense of breaking links in the drugs supply chain. Yesterday, the task force agreed on several recommendations for improving our collective response. They include formalising the links between agencies with a role to play in tackling drugs; developing intelligence links between the agencies; strengthening our links with Europol, bearing in mind the international drugs trade connections; strengthening links with the Garda; and examining the effectiveness of existing legislation, to which the hon. Member for South Antrim referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before time is up, would the Minister address the point about the admissibility of phone-tapping evidence?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jane Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Bearing in mind that time is short, I will answer the questions on interception after I have broadly reviewed the legislation. My comments on the task force will give the Committee an idea of how we are making progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much other imaginative work is already under way, over and above the operational activities by the police and other agencies; for example, the Forensic Science Service is developing its profiling of drugs seizures to produce intelligence material on supply routes, in addition to the excellent analytical services it already provides. A strategic intelligence analyst has been working with the drugs squad for some time to improve the flow of intelligence about drug-related matters. Analysing information from individual crimes to develop an overall picture will assist in intelligence-led policing. Much more remains to be done, but I wish to pay tribute to the agencies for their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lembit Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Lady give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Jane Kennedy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will not give way. I am running out of time, and I want to get to the point about interception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC2001-2002V010P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
In October, police in the north-west seized cannabis resin with a street value of £500,000 and, in November, police in County Antrim seized drugs, including cocaine, worth £700,000. The police take action against criminals who are involved in drugs peddling, and anyone with information on this evil trade should pass it on to the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland will also benefit from the Proceeds of Crime Bill, which is before Parliament. It will enhance powers to seize criminals' assets and will apply directly to those who deal in drugs. Northern Ireland will be included in the remit of the proposed assets recovery agency. Action will be taken to remove the financial power base from which many criminals, including paramilitaries, operate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On interception, I must tell hon. Members that the balance of opinion among law enforcement agencies, including those engaged in gathering intelligence, is to retain the present prohibition on the use of interception. The general consensus did not change after 11 September. However, the position will be kept under review; my colleagues in the Home Office are regularly in contact with us about such matters. A balance must be struck between the advantages of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
using interception and the damage that might be done by disclosure of operational techniques to organised criminals who would be able to adapt their operations to avoid police interception.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had hoped to give a longer explanation of what the Government are doing and to explain some of the education, treatment and rehabilitation work of the devolved Assembly. I will look at the projects that the hon. Member for South Antrim mentioned, and I will also get a copy of the book that he recommended; I look forward to reading it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Committee will accept that all parts of government, whether devolved or not, recognise the threat that illegal drugs pose to all sections of the community, especially to the young and the vulnerable. The task is not easy, but I am confident that if we work together and encourage maximum cooperation among the agencies, we will make progress in tackling the issue to the benefit of everyone in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
