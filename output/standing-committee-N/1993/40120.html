	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the Health Service in Northern Ireland.</p></blockquote>
To leave as much time as possible for hon. Members to take part in the debate. I do not intend to speak for long. The Government welcome the debate on the matter has been chosen for today, I shall briefly set a scene that I hope may inform the debate, which I look forward to hearing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members know, my noble Friend Lord Arran, who had responsibility for health and social services in Northern Ireland since April 1992, has moved to other duties and has been succeeded by my noble Friend Lady Denton. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to him for his dedication and commitment not only to health and personal social services but also to agriculture during his time in Northern Ireland. I am sure that all members of the Committee wish him well in his new duties. Equally, I am delighted that Lady Denton is joining the Northern Ireland team. She is the first lady to do so and I know that she will bring with her an enthusiasm and a fresh perspective to the many issues both in health and personal social services and in agriculture which, rightly, are of great concern to the people of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of integrated health and personal social services in Northern Ireland is the envy of the rest of the United Kingdom and beyond, and its dedicated staff have a record of achievement that is second to none. Any public service, however excellent, can always be improved and must change to meet the changing needs and expectations of the people it serves. Health and social services are no exception to that rule. In Northern Ireland, as in the rest of the United Kingdom, in the past few years there has been what is undoubtedly the greatest period of change since the inception of the national health service and the welfare state. Against that background it is perhaps timely to review the achievements, to take stock of the changes, and, as far as possible, to look to the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall start by considering some of the achievements in hospital services. The average number of patients treated in each acute hospital in Northern Ireland over the past five years has increased by 20 per cent. The number of people who receive high-quality treatment on a day basis increased over the same period by more than 50 per cent. The total number of cardiac surgery operations increased from less than 700 in 1988 to an expected 1,100 in this and subsequent years. The impact of those statistics on hospital waiting lists has been dramatic. Between April 1991 and April 1993, waiting lists for ordinary admissions to hospital decreased by 2,300 to a little more than 24,000, and the number of those waiting for two years or more decreased by almost 4,000, or 80 per cent, to a little more than 1,000. On the health promotion front, also, there have been achievements over the past 10 years. The perinatal
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
mortality rate has more than halved, and, since the launch of the "Change of Heart" coronary prevention programme in 1986, the number of deaths from coronary heart disease has fallen by almost 25 per cent. I am sure that we all welcome that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past few years there have been a number of important reforms in the health service in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the United Kingdom. The fundamental principle underlying the reforms package is the purchaser-provider split, whereby health and social services boards retain responsibility for assessing the health and social care needs of their resident populations and for purchasing services to meet those needs from a range of providers, including newly-formed trusts. That has permitted the formation of an internal market, which allows for a degree of healthy competition between hospitals and other provider units, and has already led to improvements in the quality of care delivered to patients and clients, not least through the greater involvement of doctors, nurses, social workers and other professionals in the decision-making process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The creation of health and social services trusts is of 'particular significance. The management freedoms which come with trust status are designed to devolve decisionmaking to those responsible for delivering services, offering them the opportunity to be imaginative and responsive to local needs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Significant progress has already been made. By April 1994, more than 50 per cent, of expenditure on health and social services in Northern Ireland will be accounted for by trusts, which means that the majority of the population will by then benefit from greater choice and higher quality care within a value-for-money framework. Consideration is already being given to another round of trust applications which will further enhance the quality of services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Nevertheless, the improvement of services through contracting is heavily dependent upon developing the purchasing process to the point where it can effectively drive service changes. Before moving to his new Department, my noble Friend Lord Arran instigated a review of purchasing functions and structures throughout Northern Ireland. The review group is scheduled to report to my noble Friend Lady Denton by the end of May, and I look forward keenly to seeing the outcome of their deliberations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most significant aspects of purchaser development has been the introduction of GP fundholding. This scheme began operating in Northern Ireland in April 1993, two years later than in the rest of the United Kingdom. From that date, 20 general medical practices began to refer their patients for a range of services under contracts—which they had negotiated—and to pay for those services from their own fund. Fundholding is at the leading edge of the health and social care reforms, and there is evidence that fundholders are improving the service to their patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From April 1994, a further 24 practices are likely to join the scheme, by which time 26 per cent, of the population of Northern Ireland will belong to fundholding practices. Such coverage was reached in England only in the third year of the scheme's operation. That is a clear indication of the great interest of Northern Ireland GPs in the scheme, and, over the next two or three years, I would expect more than half the population to be covered by fundholding practices.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0280">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Important changes have also been taking place in the delivery of community care. Last April, major changes were introduced in the structure and organisation of these services in Northern Ireland, at the heart of which is the aim to sustain people in their homes or in other community settings as far as possible and to meet their needs through rigorous individual assessment and care management. We are determined through that process to enable dependent and elderly people to remain longer in their homes, to reduce the number of people in psychiatric hospitals and largely to eliminate the need for people to be admitted to hospital because of learning difficulties, hon. Members will agree that these are important and worthy aims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community care reforms will not be without cost, and it is indicative of the Government's commitment to them that more than £100 million of additional resources is being made available to boards for the provision of community care services. While I am on the subject of money, I am glad to that my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State was recently able to announce a real-terms increase in funding for health and personal social services, including the family practitioner services, by allocating £1,423 billion for 1994–95. That means that for yet another year we have been able to honour our manifesto commitment to provide a year-on-year real increase in resources. Services of the standard that are available in Northern Ireland do not come cheaply; indeed, they will cost next year £863 for each man, woman and child, but that is a bill that the Government are glad to pay on behalf of the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope—although perhaps it is a vain hope in any political forum—that members of the Committee will agree that what I have said adds up to a positive picture of the state of health and personal social services in Northern Ireland. The services there are as good as those anywhere in the world and Northern Ireland can be proud of them. I hope that hon. Members will join me in acknowledging and applauding the enormous contribution made by those who work in the health service to its continuing standards of excellence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. James Molyneaux 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister mentioned the good work done by Lord Arran who had been taking a grip on what was otherwise a rather see-saw approach to hospital and personal social services in what is known as the Down-Lisburn area. Will the Minister convey to Lady Denton our respectful suggestion that she examine that good work and continue consideration of the issue? I am sure that my views are shared by the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for raising that matter. I spoke this morning to my noble Friend Lady Denton and she asked me to tell the Committee that she would be delighted to speak to any Northern Ireland Member about constituency health worries. She has also said that she will certainly be continuing the work that was undertaken by my noble Friend Lord Arran before his departure. I shall certainly pass to her the right hon. Gentleman's message.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We understand that the consultation period for the proposals submitted by the Eastern health and social services board to the Department expires on 28 February. The document to which that relates was the result of a decision at a public meeting of the
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
Eastern health and social services board on 25 November 1993. However, on 7 December the Minister issued a press release which, I think, destroyed confidence in the consultation process. The document was a weighty one, embracing as it did all the major teaching hospitals and the other acute hospitals in the entire East Down area, yet within 10 working days the Minister was able to make a statement that included a reference to maternity services in certain areas. He continued by stating:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It is right that the board has drawn attention to my Department's guidelines on consultant obstetric services and the fact that the Mater hospital, the Lagan Valley hospital and the Downpatrick hospital do not meet those guidelines. I would expect the board to offer all three hospitals a reasonable period to demonstrate that they can meet the deadlines. If they cannot do so I would expect the board to cease purchasing consultant obstetric services from them."</p></blockquote>
In other words the Minister is pre-empting the consultative period that he has said will, and which we know should, continue until at least 28 February. Will he assure us that the outcome is not a fait accompli, because arguments to the contrary have not been made?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the hon. Gentleman will allow me I shall deal with the specific matter of Downe hospital a little later in my remarks. I know that there has been much concern about the Eastern health and social services board strategy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Seamus Mallow 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Newry and Armagh)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman want to intervene before I reply?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am looking carefully at the Minister's notes and I see that he is coming to the end of his speech. I hope that before he finishes he will, in addition to all his complimentary remarks-some of which I agree with and some of which I do not—make a specific and substantive reference to the Government's plans for the restructuring of the area boards in the north of Ireland. If that matter, which is very serious for the whole health service, is not at least raised here and dealt with by the Minister, it would seem that a fundamental element of this discussion will have been avoided or evaded.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes the progress of my remarks rather difficult. I should like to keep to the structure. I assure him that although he may have felt that my speech was coming to an end, I have a little more to say. However, I do not want to take up too much of the Committee's time. I should like to deal with the specific points raised about Downe hospital and the Eastern health and social services board in due course, but I shall touch on the review of the four boards now, as the hon. Gentleman has mentioned it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since April 1993, the role of Northern Ireland's four boards has changed significantly. They now concentrate their efforts on assessing the needs of their residents and making arrangements with providers for the purchase of services. My noble Friend Lady Denton will be taking forward a review on the way in which the new purchasing arrangements are carried out in Northern Ireland. The review will consider the existing structures for purchasing in Northern Ireland and make recommendations on how the purchasing function should be discharged in accordance with Government policy as effectively and efficiently as possible.

	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
That is the remit within which the review will take place. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman accepts that when a review is about to be set up, the most damaging thing for a Minister to do would be to predict the outcome. I have given the hon. Gentleman the background to the review, and I hope that it is broad enough to satisfy his concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the function of a board is much more comprehensive than that of a purchasing agency? A successful health board is made up of human, local and caring elements. If the Minister, as his reply suggests, regards boards simply as purchasing agencies, we will lose sight of a very important factor in the creation of area boards.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I undertake to pass the hon. Gentleman's comments to my noble Friend Lady Denton, as I am sure that she will wish to know what he has to say. I repeat my noble Friend's offer that she is ready to meet right hon. and hon. Members to hear representations directly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was told yesterday that constituency boundaries in Northern Ireland are to be changed. This is always an exciting matter in Northern Ireland. The current proposals show that constituencies will now cut through several board areas. I hope that the review will take into account that it may be necessary to revise the boundaries of the area health boards to comply with the new constituency boundaries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Angram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly draw that point to the attention of my noble Friend, and I am sure that she will take account of it. Having suffered several times in my life from the results of boundary changes, I learnt a long time ago not to comment on what is apparently an independent part of our democratic process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the review is proceeding. Have the Minister's advisers given him any response to give Nick May who, as director of the health care research group at Queen's university, says that the review is unnecessary because it does not even take into account that the boards in Northern Ireland have a wider role than the health authorities here?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will pass the hon. Gentleman's comments to my noble Friend. I am not trying to duck his question, but he will appreciate that these are matters for which she has responsibility and on which she will take decisions. It is only right that I do not pre-empt her consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to turn to a number of issues of concern that have been raised in interventions by hon. Members. The Eastern health and social services board has been working for some time to develop a strategy for its acute hospitals. Last November, the board published its strategy and I know that some of its proposals have provoked a good deal of comment and debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall briefly remind hon. Members of the main elements of the board's strategy. They are, first, that the two large Belfast teaching hospital trusts, the Belfast City hospital and the Royal group of hospitals should be reconstituted as a single trust and that the services they provide should be rationalised; secondly, that the Lagan Valley hospital and Downe hospital should be encouraged to provide an integrated service in future; thirdly, that the Mater hospital will need to form links with other larger hospitals if it is to
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
be viable in the future; and fourthly, that the Ulster hospital requires capital investment if it is to meet the needs of its catchment population.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall finish my remarks before giving way. I wish to explain the position as it stands because that might pre-empt the hon. Gentleman's question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These are propositions of considerable significance, and that is why my noble Friend Lady Denton is currently engaged in extremely wide-ranging consultations with the many people and organisations with an interest in these important matters. It would be wrong to pre-empt the outcome of that consultation by commenting now on the specific issues raised in the board's strategy. I am aware, however, that the Eastern health and social services board has put enormous effort into devising these proposals for the future of its acute services, and my noble Friend has asked me to say that she will give the most careful consideration to the comments that she receives from all concerned. She is confident that the outcome of this process 'will be a firm plan for acute services in the Eastern area into the next century which will be to the benefit of everyone in Northern Ireland who uses them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the Ulster hospital and its capital funding, long ago when the right hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. King) was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, a capital funding promise of £5 million was made. What are the current capital funding proposals for the Ulster hospital and when might we see some action?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I said earlier, it is important that I do not pre-empt the consideration that my noble Friend will give to all the issues surrounding the strategy. However, I shall pass the hon. Gentleman's comments to my noble Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister impress upon the board the importance of giving priority to the provision of hospitals with large catchment areas? For example, in London there has been a reduction in the .number of hospitals in the city area, but more hospitals have been provided outside the Greater London area. In Northern Ireland, the position seems to be the reverse. In my constituency, many people from Ballygowan, Killinchy and Comber go to Downpatrick. It is important that the Downe hospital should be retained there. Similarly, many people are moving out of the city of Belfast to places such as Castlereagh and Ards and into North Down. It is important that priority is given to that area even if that is at the expense of Belfast city.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman raises a substantive point. I shall ensure that it is made known to my noble Friend. Again, he will understand that it would be improper for me to pre-empt any consideration that she may make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been particularly intense debate recently about the future of the Downe hospital obstetric unit—the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) raised that issue—not least because my noble Friend Lord Arran stated that the hospital must demonstrate that it can meet the Department's criteria for consultant obstetric services. In making that statement, my noble Friend was doing no
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0282">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
more than reminding the public of his Department's longstanding policy that consultant obstetric units must be able to demonstrate that they can meet the quality standards set down for these services in the interests of both mothers and babies. In being required to do so, the Downe hospital is in a position no different from that of any other consultant obstetric unit in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This matter is central to much of the debate about maternity services that is taking place in Northern Ireland. Presumably civil servants in the Department—not the profession—have dictated that the economic throughput figure for a maternity unit is 2,000 babies. A year ago, that figure was 1,000 babies. There is no professional reason why that should be so. I received a letter from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, stating that that is not the case. It maintains that much smaller units, which are consultant-led or midwifery-led, are viable and even quotes Northern Ireland as a good example of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter to which Lord Arran referred in the press release that I mentioned earlier is artificial. It has been set up by civil servants and has nothing to do with patient care, with convenience to the community, with cost effectiveness or with the quality of clinical efficiency. It is merely a paper exercise by the Department. Will the Minister confirm that a study group in the Department is currently re-examining the concept of the approach to maternity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Ulster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) has had the opportunity of having his problem heard. On the other hand, when it came to the west of the Province, the Department decided not to hear the case, but to rape an excellent service there, whether for considerations of political dogma or of gerrymandering. The maternity service at Omagh hospital is closing and being moved to the Erne hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister knows well that there is no overall plan for maternity services in the Province. Therefore, hospital was set against hospital. Why did the Northern Ireland Office state on 28 October 1993 that the DHSS announced the establishment of a maternity unit study group when it had already decided to close the maternity service without considering as a whole that service across the Province? I am delighted that Lady Denton has said that she will consider the matter—I have already written to her—because people in the west of the Province have been discriminated against and the people of Omagh have been treated despicably. If there is a maternity unit study group, it should be allowed to examine maternity services across the Province and to come up with a proper scheme to enable everyone to be treated equally.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Joe Hendron 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It may save time if I give way to the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Hendron) and then answer all interventions together.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My point also relates to the proposals for Lagan Valley and Downpatrick hospitals, to the figure of 2,000 births and, as the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea) mentioned, to the establishment of a maternity study group. There is a movement towards new GP-led units. Support for that idea has varied over the years, but at this time there is much to be said for GP-led
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
units, and certainly for midwifery-led units, in Britain and in other countries. It seems odd that a threat hangs over the Lagan Valley hospital and those in Downpatrick and Omagh while GP-led units are being discussed. I participated in such a unit for many years and I am delighted that there are signs of those units returning. However, the Government must carefully consider this issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to have an opportunity to set out the Government's position on the matter. As the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster will appreciate, decisions such as that relating to Omagh hospital are never easy. Although it is not my specific area of responsibility, I know that Ministers gave enormous consideration to the issue before decision were taken. I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman's comments are relayed to my noble Friend Lady Denton.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Down is to have a meeting with my noble Friend, who is looking forward to hearing his representations. However, she is keen to extend the choice available to women of where and how they have babies. That is at the heart of the Government's policy. The Government are committed to ensuring that Northern Ireland has high quality and safe maternity services. Members of the Committee will agree that those criteria must be met. Services must be responsive to the needs and wants of the women who use them. The Department is considering how the range of options of care during childbirth available to mothers in Northern Ireland might best be extended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A study group, which has been referred to, has been established to consider the potential of enhancing existing services by the development of units that could be led by midwives and/or GPs. The work of the group is regarded by the Government as part of the wider process of considering the development of and potential for improving maternity services. The Department will, for example, monitor closely the developments in maternity services nationally, such as those flowing from the Cumberledge report, and consider their implications for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have been able to demonstrate that the Government are concerned about provision of services within the Province and that my noble Friend in particular, who has just joined the Department, wants to hear representations about these matters. Having heard them, she will show how keen she is to extend the choices available to women.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister realises that Omagh hospital still exists: it is not closed. Therefore, if existing services are being studied no step should be taken to close Omagh hospital until it is given fair recognition, using the criteria by which every other hospital is being considered. It is not correct to state that it is being given fair play while the process of closure is being worked on right now, even though the study group is sitting. That is a joke and makes a mockery of what the Minister is saying to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman's comments are relayed to my noble Friend. She will take cognisance of the strong feelings that he has expressed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0283">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
I do not want to take up too much more of the Committee's time. I said that I would make a short speech, but my contribution has become longer than I intended. I hope that what I have said will at least reassure hon. Members that the state of health and personal social services in Northern Ireland is of concern to the Government, has improved over the past few years and is in general healthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Together with my colleagues, I shall try to ensure that there is a good prognosis for the future. Hon. Members will want to ask questions. I hope to respond to them, but will ensure that my noble Friend is aware of the issues that are raised. She may want to respond to some questions in writing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.3 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister said, a number of hon. Members want to take part in the debate. We want to hear what Northern Ireland Members have to say about such an important and significant matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate is being held because of the controversy about the Government's proposals to reorganise health and social services boards in Northern Ireland. The measures in the draft health and social services proposal would transfer to 13 community trusts responsibility for health and personal social services. I stress that that includes the statutory powers relating to mental health, child protection and community care assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister referred briefly to community care. I thought that he would suggest how the Department will address the giving of statutory powers relating to mental health, child protection and community care assessment to private organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's proposals have been criticised by a wide range of groups concerned with health and personal social services. Social service functions are already administered by unelected boards, and the transfer of statutory powers and services provision to independent trusts would reinforce this lack of public accountability. I hope that the Minister will tell us how he envisages the application of statutory powers to private organisations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is improper for powers under mental health, child protection and community care legislation to be handed over to the private sector. The creation of so many trusts within the Province is excessive and will lead to further bureaucracy in the provision of Northern Ireland services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have looked at the matter carefully and despite denials from the Department of Health, there has been clear ministerial interest in this development in Northern Ireland. There is some anxiety in regions of England and Wales that the Northern Ireland model for changes in the provision of services could be used as a basis for the long-term removal of social services functions from local authorities in other parts of Britain, especially in the context of current local government reorganisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, the implementation of services and the provision of orders for Northern Ireland have come about as a result of similar measures being introduced in other parts of Britain. I fear that, following the introduction of these measures, some of the functions and orders imposed in Northern Ireland will be imposed in other parts of Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
I warn the Minister that not only Opposition Members but Conservative Members will oppose the Government if they try to make the changes that I fear will follow the introduction of these measures in Northern Ireland. In considering the statutory powers relating to mental health, child protection and community care assessment, the Minister should think carefully about implementation, and the consequences of changes being made without full consideration of all the proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's case for the proposals is that they are necessary to preserve Northern Ireland's unique integrated health and personal social services administration. The Government imposed their health and social services trust structure on hospital units in Northern Ireland against the wishes of the vast majority of its population. The Minister is now arguing that there is a weakness in the law that prevents the extension of the trust structure to the community care units which undertake statutory functions, such as taking children into care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are sensitive powers involved in the restriction of civil liberties when, for example, children are taken into care or mentally ill patients detained. The Minister should 'consider that matter seriously and advise his noble Friend that it should not be taken lightly. There should be full consultation. The wider public should be involved when the question of the transference of statutory powers is considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend about the creation of trust hospitals. Only a few weeks ago I tabled a parliamentary question about the proposed creation of a trust that would involve a hospital in my constituency. I asked what consultation there had been with the hon. Member for South Down, whose area it affected. The answer was none. What consultation was there with the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh or with Newry and Mourne council? None. What consultation had there been—wait for it—with the Southern health and social services board? The answer was none. Surely that lays the lie that the Government have been propagating—that the community is consulted and that it at least acquiesces in the progress towards the creation of trusts. Before today's sitting is over, the Minister must either refute what I said or answer it and give an explanation. Otherwise we cannot escape the conclusion that the Government are not interested in finding out or assessing what people think about trusts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That intervention was significant in the light of my argument. If there has been consultation, an explanation should be provided of why the hon. Gentleman was misled. If there has been none, it is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that the communities in Northern Ireland are made aware of the Department's intentions and that full consultation follows. Note should be taken of points made by individuals and groups. Consideration of matters that touch upon child protection and the care of the mentally ill should not be a charade.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same applies to the assessment of elderly people admitted into care. In Great Britain, local authority social service workers are responsible for assessing old people who need community care. Under the legislation, an independent person—perhaps unconnected with the social service professions—will make the assessment. It is an important issue. If the Government intend to introduce private bodies to administer social services trusts, a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0284">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
properly trained social worker must be present to help to make the assessment. Anything less should not be considered. Will the Minister provide some assurance that professional people will be involved in the assessment of elderly people for community care?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The same considerations apply to the taking into care of children. We need assurances that the people who will do that work are properly trained and able to make a judgment about the future care of a child. Similarly, the mentally disabled or ill need professional, properly trained people to look after their needs. The legislation makes no provision for that protection. I dwell on that issue because the reorganisation of hospitals has been admirably covered by the hon. Members for the area concerned, but I fear that if we do not get community care provision right, many people in Northern Ireland will suffer as a consequence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will change fundamentally the responsibility for the operation of those powers. Existing law restricts responsibility for the discharge of those important statutory functions to health and social services boards, which are direct agents of a Government Department. The existing law was carefully framed to safeguard public interests and to provide clear lines of responsibility and accountability for those sensitive services. The proposed legislation did not receive such careful and sincere consideration when the provisions for the transfer of functions were drawn up. Before any action is taken, there should be further discussions with the people involved in providing the services, and with the trade unions who organise those people, to ensure that there is no loss of service and responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals will allow the transfer of responsibility for the services in Northern Ireland to the new trusts. Provision of the services will then be governed by the trusts, and that returns us to the point made by the Minister about the purchaser-provider syndrome. Our fear is that we shall not consider what an elderly person requires, the proper care that a child should receive, or the care or consideration that a mentally ill person should receive—but we shall consider what the care will cost. I know of examples from my own region where cost is the prime consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I put that point strongly to the Minister because if he cares for the retention of the community care services—I believe that he does—he will realise that cost should not be the first factor but the needs of the patient. I hope that point will be reflected in the Government's proposals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument, but would he not he not be amazed to be told that when a delegation met the noble Lord, it raised the question of whether proper costing of the scheme had been done? We believe that the scheme will add unnecessary costs and take money from the care of patients and clients. There is a place for costing. Although I accept the thrust of the hon. Gentleman's argument, some costing must be taken into consideration—especially when dealing with overall administration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not disagree that there should be a value-for-money exercise. However, that should start with the administration and management side of providing the services. That issue should be targeted at the Government. If they do not, how will we know whether value for money has been achieved?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
If a person need specialist treatment or care, that care should be provided—and not depend on whether we can afford to provide that service. Such considerations will be taken into account if the proposals are introduced in then-present form. I ask the Minister to reconsider them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government propose to extend the provisions of the Children Act 1989 to Northern Ireland. It is proposed to introduce major changes in the law relating to children. The proposals focus on the duties and responsibilities of health and social services boards as agents of the state. Unions and people in the service have argued that there should be no change in administration structures until the draft Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1994 is implemented. The Minister should assure us that there will be no changes before the order has been considered and implemented. If changes are made it will be difficult for those who have arguments about the order to be fair and effective.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister recorded the achievements in hospitals in Northern Ireland. I accept the achievements. The staff have been providing a good, useful and fulfilling service, but is the Minister aware that staff morale is at an all-time low? Is he also aware that hospital staff are asking what their future "will be in view of the Government's proposals for change? Before any action is taken the providers of services should be consulted. They should have an input to discussions about the future of the service. The Minister should address these significant matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My anxieties were increased when I realised that the Minister did not refer to statutory powers that will be transferred to private organisations—the new private trusts. Before action is taken the Minister should review the proposals and talk to the people who provide services, ensuring that their worries are considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.22 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity for Northern Ireland Members to discuss this most important issue. It goes to the heart of the needs of our constituents and there is no other forum in which we can have a detailed debate about the welfare, health and social services provision for the people of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My party requested this sitting of the Committee to discuss a lively issue that keenly exercises the minds of members of the Committee. Perhaps members of the Committee will consider taking a second opportunity to discuss the matter. All Northern Ireland constituencies are affected by these serious matters, which are worthy of more than a quick brush over.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The previous Prime Minister said, "The health service is safe in our hands." There is a genuine and general anxiety that the Government have been and are carrying out a systematic dismantling of the health service. That has many repercussions for patients and for the morale of doctors, nurses and ancillary staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Ulster Democratic Unionist party believe that the health service should be free to all at the point of need—not provided according to the Exchequer's financial policy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot cover all issues in the health service this morning, but some give us cause for great anxiety. It is sad that the Minister responsible for such a major portfolio in the Province is not present in the Committee to be questioned personally. However, I hope that the Minister representing the Department today will tell Lady Denton that requests for a meeting have been made, by telephone
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0285">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
and in writing, on behalf of my constituents. As she is so willing to have a meeting as a matter of urgency, I am looking forward to an early date for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
like other hon. Members, I agree that, with advances in medical and surgical techniques, some changes, such as shorter stays in hospital, are possible. The review had more to do with financial constraints than with some of the reasons proferred by the boards. As the boards have a good opportunity to abrogate their responsibility and pass the onus for cuts in health care and staffing to the trusts, they are distancing themselves from some of the major issues in the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister touched on an important matter when he referred to the fundamental principle and said that the internal market had increased the quality delivered to the patient. The only people who can and have a right to make that judgment are not the officials in Stormont or the Ministers responsible in the Department, but those who actually experience what is happening throughout the health service. A business approach of itself is not the best way forward and it is erroneous to believe that market testing provides value for money and a better service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should have an efficient service. I do not accept inefficiency, or that efficiency is impossible, but I believe that we need an efficient, caring and responsive health service that meets the needs of those in the local community instead of an impersonal concrete jungle approach, which seems to be the way for future development. Local hospitals are being undermined and people are being forced into great concrete jungles. That happened with housing in the Province some years ago and we are paying the price for that now through many community problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The move toward trust status for hospitals was introduced so that the boards could have a finite amount of money available to them, thereby avoiding the blame if or when the hospital or unit runs out of funds. In that way, the Government can sidestep picking up the shortfall. We all know the result: operations are cancelled, waiting lists are lengthened, beds are removed, services are cut and staff are not replaced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And patients die.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When all those things happen, the only possible outcome is that patients die. Due to the underfunding of hospitals, beds are taken up by people from another country. The trusts have the power to sell their services to whoever will pay for them and the purchasing power of our local boards has been cut so drastically that they have no more money to purchase services for our own people. As a result, waiting lists will grow steadily longer and treatment will be based on money considerations. We do not believe in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is concern that a two or three-tier health system is evolving in the Province. Those who have the money can jump the queue. Over the years people in the Province have paid their contributions towards the health service. They have relied on, and enjoyed, a good and efficient service. Unfortunately, they now see people paying thousands of pounds to have their operations immediately. Those without sufficient money have to wait for a considerable time—perhaps years—for operations, and if they die in the interim, that solves the problem of funding. That, unfortunately, is what is happening in the system that is evolving in the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

Care-in-the-community changes have caused great distress. The changes that have taken place since 1st April last year have been traumatic, to say the least. There is genuine concern that, while the Government forced the changes through, there were no services to back up their great talk about care in the community. I shall give an example that relates to the care of the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was at a meeting the other day of senior officers of a board in the Province. I heard about the number of people who are forced back into the community straight after having an operation. It was pointed out that there was no money to keep them in hospital, so there was no alternative. It sometimes happens that while elderly people are just getting over an operation, someone sticks a leaflet under their nose for a local nursing home and asks if they want to go there. That is totally unacceptable. If they need proper hospital treatment, they should be treated in a health service hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee will be aware of the difficulties that can occur over the way in which fees are extracted from people who enter nursing homes. I have written about this matter to the Minister responsible. There 'are many small farmholdings in my constituency, many of which have been passed down through generations. I am thinking in particular of two elderly ladies in my constituency who went into a nursing home. They had a small farmholding which had been passed down the family through generations. That farm had to be sold, and the family is now no longer part of that community. In fact, after both ladies died, the last of the money was drained off. It is a tragedy that that little farm has now been taken away from the family. That does nothing for the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That should not be Conservative party philosophy. On the mainland, many of these folk would be regarded as Conservatives, yet they are the ones being penalised. This issue is causing great concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like the Minister to consider carefully the situation of Derg Valley hospital in Castlederg. It is an outpost in the Province and has endured much because of terrorism. However, many elderly people are worried that Derg Valley hospital will be closed. It serves only the elderly but it has given excellent service. While the talk of its closure continues, it is interesting to note that there has been an increase in applications for nursing homes beds in that area. Those factors are working hand in glove.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The state has a responsibility for the elderly people of the Province, who built the prosperity that many parts of it now enjoy. We should treat them with dignity. Let us take the example of a small farmholding. We should not allow such a holding to be decimated and lose its family name because the farm would have to be sold if its elderly owner went into a nursing home. That person should be enabled to stay in the community, but the current provision of services is far from adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another cause of great concern is the closure or downgrading of rural hospitals. On behalf of my colleagues, I deplore the closure programme for small, local general and maternity units and for emergency services. Many other services to the community will be lost because of the financial contraints imposed by the Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a despicable way to treat the people of Northern Ireland, especially following the publication of the patients charter, working for patients and patient choice documents. The watermark for the charter was designed by a young lady from my constituency, but as soon as the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0286">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
charter is introduced, she will not be able to give birth in Omagh hospital—the hospital to which she has always looked for help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is all very fine for the Minister to suggest consultation, but if he discusses the issue with any section of the community or with any political party, he will find that they are disgusted with the charade that has been termed consultation. There has been no meaningful consultation, and many hospitals have been closed by those who are nothing more than Government nominees. They will not offend the Government to whom they owe their position. Those people have no relevance to the community and show no heart by hacking back its services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Omagh object to the fact that their maternity unit is earmarked for closure even though there has been no overall consideration of maternity services across the Province. Such a piecemeal approach pits one hospital against another and patients against each other, which is not what community or hospital provision is all about. It should be about providing what is right for all the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The rights of the people of Omagh are as equally important as the rights of the people of South Down. The people of South Down have equal rights with those of Lagan Valley, and those of Lagan Valley have equal rights with the people of Upper Bann.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, my constituents were treated despicably, and the proposals for my constituency should be stopped. The Government should look at maternity provision throughout the Province. Let us not have a piecemeal approach, but a proper programme. The proposals for Omagh hospital have frustrated and angered the people. The Government will never be forgiven if the people are denied their rights under the patients charter and the patient choice documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish Lord Arran well and thank him for many of his actions since coming to the Province. However, within three weeks he made a decision about the greatest fundamental issue in the matter of maternity services-women giving birth. No Minister can claim, within weeks of coming to the Province, to be so conversant with the issues and to have such knowledge and professional understanding of them that he can make a decision. In reality, he rubber-stamped the work of a non-elected board and of Government officials who are situated far from patients.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the abolition of places for elected members on area boards and with trust status for most of our units of management, accountability is totally lacking. I am glad to have had the opportunity to raise at least some matters. Unfortunately, one feels that even though the subject has been discussed, the Government will still do nothing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
My first question in Parliament was about health. The then Minister welcomed the question because it had been years since one was asked about Northern Ireland health matters. This is the first opportunity that I am aware of in 11 years in the House for a complete examination of health care provision in Northern Ireland, but incidental issues have been discussed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking on behalf of my party, I shall refer to general and to specific issues. I place on record that I was brought up with the concept that the Labour party was the doctrinaire party and that the Tory party was the pragmatic party. It seems that there has been a departure from the high principle of Toryism of maintaining the best. The Tories are taking a doctrinaire approach to health provision in Northern Ireland as well as elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I join the Minister in paying tribute to general care in Northern Ireland, the professionals involved and the improvements made as aspects of health care have been pioneered. However, the room for improvement is still the biggest amount of room in the world. I was fascinated by the Minister's response to the hon. Member for Belfast, East about the Ulster hospital, which was for years earmarked for capital investment, that has not been made. We are discussing the possibility of it arriving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While politicians and boards may carry the stick of responsibility, a large proportion of the changes within Great Britain and Northern Ireland were pioneered by developments in medical sciences and in technology. Maternity provision in Northern Ireland have not for years been patient-led, but obstetrician-led. That is the problem. The Select Committee on Health examined in depth maternity provision throughout the United Kingdom and referred in particular to Northern Ireland. The Department would not accept its advice to withdraw regurgitated guidance designed by obstetricians that did not focus on the needs of patients in the modern age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department began to fence, and I understand that even the new Committee may be having great difficulty dealing with the obstetricians. It is they who, through the years, changed the provisions. For example, my eldest daughter was born in the Royal Maternity hospital. We were told that our second child could not be born there because the hospital was for specialist cases or for first deliveries. When something went wrong during pregnancy my wife was admitted to the Royal Maternity hospital. For our third child there was no way that she could go there and so she had to go to Malone Place hospital. There is now no hospital at Malone Place. The pattern of general practitioner and of midwifery deliveries has changed. I am delighted that a new thrust is emerging, and I trust that officials in the Department will not yield to over-pressure by obstetricians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At one stage obstetricians demanded 3,000 deliveries on an acute site but because they discovered that that was unreasonable they reduced the figure to 2,500. The Select Committee report suggested provision in rural areas of England and Wales where there are 100 deliveries per year in units. It is unreasonable that that modest choice was set aside, partly because doctors have not been trained in maternity. We recognise that success breeds success: the more cases handled the less likelihood of mistakes. However, having been born in a two-up, two-down house
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
as a second twin delivered by a midwife, it seems to me that we must again give preference to midwife-led obstetric services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Eastern board plans for the Royal Victoria and City hospitals go back at least 30 years. In those days, there was a full model plan of joint provision and even a suggestion of a tunnel under Donegall Road from the City to the Royal Victoria. The Eastern board will be held responsible for current plans which were proposed long before its involvement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I share the anxiety of hon. Members about provision in rural areas. I recognise that mistakes have been made in the development of hospital services in Belfast. When the Mater hospital ceased to be independent and became part of the health service it should have been told that as others had to "port" so it must "port" because of the declining population and over-provision in the centre of Belfast. Anyone with foresight could have seen that at the time. A modern hospital has now been built on the Crumlin Road, less than half a mile from the Royal Victoria hospital, which is less than half a mile from the City hospital. We must hold responsible for that waste of money the officials in the Department who were responsible for the overall provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The philosophy of London and elsewhere that is guiding health care provision suggests that provision for specialist units, such as maternity facilities, should be made on acute hospital sites. There is now a possibility of changing the provision of a specialist cancer unit at Belvoir and of an outstanding orthopaedic unit at Musgrave Park. Pressures are being brought to bear. There is talk of developing specialist cancer services on the site of the Royal Victoria hospital or that of the City hospital, but there in not enough land to provide even the car parking spaces that are required daily at Belvoir for the convenience not just of staff but of patients needing day treatment and for visitors. It is time to get away from that doctrinaire approach and recognise that centres of excellence such as Belvoir and Musgrave orthopaedic unit can operate on independent sites, especially in a community like Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm the special ethos in Belvoir Park hospital when dealing with cancer and related diseases? That specialist care has been built up over the years and it cannot be reflected in money, bricks or machinery. Surely he agrees that it would be a tragedy if any attempt were made to disperse what has been so carefully nurtured and what is of such great benefit to our community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no difficulty in agreeing with the hon. Gentleman. I have a long connection with the place as a pastor, just as I had when I was an assistant chaplain in Musgrave Park hospital. I know those hospitals as I know most hospitals in Northern Ireland and the work that they have carried out over the years. Centres of excellence should not be diminished simply because of a doctrinaire approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) and hon. Members referred to the concept of community trusts and community care. I have no hesitation in defending care in the community. If we can provide it, it is the best way forward, I agree with the recommendation of the Select Committee on Social Services, which highlighted that it was not a cheap option. Over the years, I have visited large
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0288">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
mental hospitals and discovered patients who should not have been in them. They had been put in such hospitals because of the lack of suitable provision in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the thrust towards care in the community. However, not enough thought has been given to the setting up of the community trusts. The noble Lord, the Under-Secretary of State was asked by a delegation representing the four main constitutional parties to re-examine the whole issue. Three members of that delegation are in Committee today. The Alliance party was represented by its health spokesman, who is not a Member of Parliament; he is a councillor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some members of the Committee will confirm that the Minister was asked about the cost of the setting up of the scheme. No costing had been undertaken. Subsequently, I received a letter from the Minister in which he said that the Government did not believe that any real addition to the cost would accrue. Given what has happened over the years, anyone who believes that must believe in Santa Clause.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am worried about escalating management costs. Today I am wearing a blue suit to show that I will not be attacking the men in grey suits. I shall not argue that the problem is caused by the managers. Some of them do good work, but there is no doubt that costs of health management have escalated—mainly at the upper level. In moments of cynicism, I reach the conclusion that the Minister did not get many people from outside sectors to manage; and that those who came in did not stick the pace. As a result, administrators who had not been administrating properly in the past were called managers and were paid £3,000 a year extra to continue not doing what they should have been doing. There was a need for better management throughout the health service. I am not sure that trusts are the way forward. The noble Lord, the Under-Secretary, assured me in several letters that he had visited the new trusts and that they were raring to go.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has any precedent been set for a Department to set up instruments without first receiving the authority of the House? The hospital health service trusts have not yet been authorised by the House, but since last September shadow boards of management have been set up. It is strange that the Department is jumping the gun without giving the House an opportunity to explore the legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of those who are involved in the community and social services are doing excellent work. They are raring to go but are worried that the legislation may not be in place to allow them to become fully operative on 1 April. But social workers and others believe that they are not ready for it. Speaking specifically as the Member for Belfast, South, I have discovered that for the past year the management unit covering south and east Belfast has been squeezed constantly on its community budget. The thrust of legislation for several years has been towards the community, but money has been taken away. The amount of home help has been reduced, even for people who have received such help for years because the community trust cannot pay for such help. What has been happening in south and east Belfast, has been happening in other places, yet money becomes available if there is sufficient pressure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot ask people, as the pharoahs did in Egypt, to make bricks without the proper equipment. To continue the biblical analogy, we cannot ask slaves in the health service, who are doing their best to serve people, to do without the necessary tools. That involves finance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
Plans are afoot to reduce by 40 per cent. the bed capacity of residential and nursing provision at the private and statutory level. That involves two scandals. The first is that the Department and boards did not enter caveats very early when private developers were opening private residential and nursing homes. Many were led into that development believing that they were filling a gap, albeit for their own investment. Under the new legislation, beds are not being occupied because the assessment procedure has taken a long time. Homes have already been sold in the Eastern board area and at least one unit in the west of the Province is trying to sell two of its homes. There will be more pressure on the hospital service as the number of voluntary and statutory homes is reduced. Where will the elderly people who need such provision obtain it? The elderly mentally infirm can remain in their own homes for only a limited period because they may need specialist care 24 hours a day. The increase in the number of those over the age of 80 will, unless a miracle cure is developed, lead to an increasing number of people with severe dementia who require such accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other side of the equation is respite. I understand that it has been calculated that only 12 respite beds are needed. Anyone who suggests such a figure is not being realistic. We are just decanting people on to neighbours or relatives without thinking that they need to take a day, a weekend or two weeks in the year off. We know what problems that will ultimately cause. Accordingly, I ask the Minister to re-examine the overall situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that a great deal of money has been put in— £25 million this year and £48 million next year if I heard correctly the dulcet tones of the chief executive on BBC Radio Ulster this morning. He was assuring us that that money would be spent. I welcome that but question the whole purchaser-provider split. At one level, the trusts, which have delegated authority under the suggested legislation, will be both purchasers and providers; they had to take on some of the boards' responsibilities. The other question is whether the boards yet know the needs of the communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an earlier thought about the movement towards hospital trusts. We were assured that trusts would have to keep a balanced provision. We were told that one of the ideas behind providing choice was that one would have to keep a check on the escalating growth and development of particular units. I do not mind doing that—I have to—but it appears that big brother, the Royal Hospital, is casting an envious eye on other provisions in the Province. The Royal group of hospitals needs better paediatric/orthopaedic provision. Despite a £20 million shortfall, it managed to find the money to allow the development of orthopaedic provision in order to tender for the first time, and it won a contract from Cork. Now we are told that that will be a wonderful addition and is a good thing. In many ways, it could be, but I understand that when a Sligo health authority began to look to Northern Ireland for similar provision, the health authorities in Dublin said no. We must check that we are not allowing an unhealthy competition to develop.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Musgrave Park orthopaedic hospital is one of three centres of excellence in the world—the others are in the United States and Italy or Spain—but it was told by the Royal's official that the provision should be transferred to the Royal hospital. The Department must keep a check on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0289">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
empire building so that there is a spread of provision throughout Northern Ireland to the benefit and advantage of all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss how health services have dealt with rationing over the years. Any person who says that there was ever a time when there was plenty of money to meet all needs has not lived in the same world as me. I remember a senior nursing officer in Scotland saying at a conference seminar that nurses have been applying rationing for years. A patient says "Nurse, can I have a bed pan?" and the reply is, "Just a second" and the second turns into a few minutes. That is a way of rationing because there are not enough staff to jump when people want them to jump. That is one illustration. What is happening under the wonderful patients charter, which says that people must be seen within a certain time, even under the appointments system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not mention its name, but for some months I have been attending for appointments at a hospital, and I have yet to keep to the time scheduled. There are problems with ward rounds and with this, that and the other. The last time I was there, I was asked if a certain doctor was available would I see him. I said yes because I had another appointment. If that is happening in my case, it is happening in many others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A study has been carried out by Booz Allen and Hamilton—not the booze that Northern Ireland can be famous for—and it states that patient-focused care could lead to proper hospital process re-engineering. Why? The study states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"For every £1 spent directly on caring for the patient, £3–£4 is spent on writing things down, scheduling work and waiting for services to be required."</p></blockquote>
The study uses an example from an accident and emergency department involving X-rays I have seen such a thing take place. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Authorised procedure requires a patient to be seen within ten minutes. Having been seen, the patient has to wait (the word should really be queue) for an available doctor. The doctor, in the majority of cases, requires an X-ray."</p></blockquote>
That enables him to diagnose and make a prescription. The study continues:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The patient must then wait (queue) for an X-ray to be taken, then queue again in casualty for a hard pressed doctor to interpret the results. Although the patient has been seen within the splendidly efficient ten minutes, a lot of good it has done him or her. It's still two hours or more (sometimes in considerable pain) before anyone can tell the patient what is wrong and start trying to do something about it—which is all the patient wants."</p></blockquote>
Booz Allen and Hamilton continue:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The redesigned process allows a nurse—under very specific conditions—to order X-rays as delegated by medical staff. In casuality, the admitting nurse only needs a reasonable amount of experience and knowledge to order the same X-ray the doctor will order an hour of suffering later. Even if the X-ray shows the seat of the trouble is not where the pain is, at least the doctor has been given a head start of useful information, and equally important, the patient feels that someone is showing some real interest in his or her problem."</p></blockquote>
I have discovered that some hospital X-ray departments play musical chairs without the music. A patient arrives, gives in his appointment card, and is asked to wait. After he has sat for 10 or 15 minutes, or half an hour in some cases, his name is called and he goes into another waiting area to go through the same procedure. Although he is there supposedly by appointment, his visit becomes a one hour or a two-hour stay before he is seen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
We have to flag up such issues and urge that health provision for Northern Ireland be not run down. I do not lay the responsibility always on the shoulders of the Department, of the Government or of the boards. Good rural hospitals have closed because royal colleges would not recognise posts. That lets them out of making the unenviable statement that they do not recognise the specialists in the posts as being capable of training.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a result, young senior house officers will fill such positions only as stopgaps because it would not count towards their training. That is a reason why there have been closures of rural provision not just in Northern Ireland, but elsewhere. The way forward is the provision of centres of excellence and, in rural areas and even in cities, old-style cottage hospitals that can serve local GPs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are other issues, and I could speak for longer on such an important subject. Although Lady Denton has to rearrange her diary, I trust that she will soon be able to fulfil the postponed appointments made by Lord Arran. I hope that it is sorted out by the end of February.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

We have heard a sorry catalogue of complaints about the national health service in Northern Ireland. That would have surprised many connected with the health service even 25 years ago. It would certainly have saddened and depressed those who launched the national health service in 1948, which is a sad state of affairs. When the health service was initiated, it was rightly claimed that it would provide medical, dental and nursing care for everyone in the community, rich and poor, young and old, man, women and child. It was envisaged as a humane institution, deeply pledged to everyone's well-being from the cradle to the grave.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the early years and until the end of the 1960s, the national health service was about human beings. The service seems to have lost its direction. The dedication of doctors, nurses and ancillary staff remains constant. Tributes to their devoted service to the patients in their care cannot be high enough. Sadly, those conscientious people have had to take second place to the bureaucrats, who seem to be in the ascendancy in Northern Ireland, certainly in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I speak for my area, I am sure that the same applies to other parts of the Province. The demand for nurses has increased yet nurses are being made redundant. Young nurses have difficulty in getting trained and then find it difficult to get a job in a hospital. That is in stark contrast to the bureaucracy, where the number of managerial staff and clerks has increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who are more important for the care of the sick and the elderly—the managerial staff or those who take care of patients in hospital or their homes? Lord Beveridge envisaged the management looking after the people. In truth, the bureaucracy now looks after itself and patients come a poor second. That selfish attitude is brazenly proclaimed by the Eastern health board, which cover my area. On entering the headquarters one sees an expensive carpet displaying the health board's logo.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0290">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
A few months ago, I repeated in the House a demand for a detailed disclosure of the number of staff working in the headquarters and the outposts of the health board with their salaries and expenses and the cost of the buildings that they occupy. I have had no answer. What has happened to the accountability of the bureaucrats to the people? Accountability is what democracy is about. I have often said—I know that my hon. Friends agree—that power needs to be handed back to the people of Northern Ireland, who can exercise it through their elected representatives. The sooner we have another Northern Ireland assembly, with its own power, the better for the people of Northern Ireland. All the issues can then be examined in the utmost detail and those officials who are responsible for the management or the mismanagement of our health service can be cross-examined and forced to explain their policy and its failure to meet the needs of the people of Northern Ireland.

The present debate—and I say this with some sadness—merely provides an illusion of responsibility. At its end, if we reach the conclusion that the Ulster people are not being provided with the health care to which they are entitled, what motion are we to endorse or reject? The motion is:
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the Health Service in Northern Ireland.</p></blockquote>
That is nonsense. We need a way to exercise muscle on behalf of the people whom we were elected to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the Ulster hospital at Dundonald in my constituency one ward was closed for some time. The hospital is a modern one, built for the people of east Belfast, Dundonald and North Down. Yet some people in the area who need hospital treatment and who go to the Ulster hospital are diverted to the centre of Belfast—either to the Royal Victoria hospital, the City hospital or the Mater hospital. Their relatives cannot easily or frequently visit them in the centre of Belfast. The distance from home increases the stress on the patient. I see no reason why people living in the North Down area of east Belfast should not be able to go to the Ulster hospital and be given a bed there, where beds are lying empty and a ward is closed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other hospital in my constituency is the Bangor hospital. It is vital to the people of the borough and the surrounding area, which has a population of at least 70,000. The Eastern health and social services board savagely cut the services provided there. I vehemently protested each time a savage cut was imposed and I was solemnly promised by the bureaucrats that services would be enhanced in due course. Despite those assurances, repeated more than once, no one in the bureaucracy is prepared to go further and to give a commitment to the enlargement of the services that the Bangor hospital provides.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is downright disgraceful. We need a hospital in Bangor, an area with an ever-growing population, to provide acute services, a casualty department and a maternity ward. I emphasised my demand in the past that Belfast should be removed from the Eastern health and social services board area. The hon. Member for Belfast, South emphasised that Belfast is over-provided with hospitals, but now less money is spent per head of the population on hospital and caring services in my constituency than in the city of Belfast. That is discrimination and it is not acceptable to the people whom I represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
No action should be taken to reduce hospital faculties or to close wards or residential homes until a new Northern Ireland assembly has had the opportunity to examine every proposal in detail. I have come to the conclusion that references by health board officials to the opportunity that people will have for consultation are a sham and a smokescreen to cover the fact that an adverse decision has already been made and will be adhered to despite local opposition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Banks residential home is an example of totally meaningless consultation. The people of Bangor were promised several times full consultation with regard to the future of that home. Some years ago, when I first alleged that the board intended to close it, the board issued a denial that was repeated the following year. However, North Down management unit has revealed that it has already decided to close that modern, purpose-built residential home—even though we are supposed to have a period of consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Officials admitted that the Banks residential home has been selected for closure because it is on a valuable site, estimated to be worth £750,000. The site was given by Dr. Nixon, a distinguished citizen of the borough of Bangor, for the specific purpose of benefiting elderly people in the area. Now, the bureaucrats have their hungry hands on that home beautiful, which serves elderly people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the end of last year, I presented a petition about Banks to the House. The people of Bangor say that Parliament is their last hope that right will be done. If Banks is closed, it will be an indictment of the way in which the health and caring services are managed in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Banks provides not only a home for elderly people but provides beds for respite care, which is essential to give relief to relatives. Officials claim that the money obtained from the closure will be used to improve community care. I am certain that it will be swallowed up by the bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we, as Members of Parliament, mean anything, we must influence policy made by bureaucrats—especially the bureaucrats of the Eastern health board. I urge the Minister to ensure that no decision is made to close the Banks residential home until we have a full opportunity of examining every aspect associated with that proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will my hon. Friend join the issue of the Banks residential home with that of Enter house in Ballybeen? Although it is my hon. Friend's constituency, it is close to my own, because I represent Castlereagh. Enler house faces the same attempt by the bureaucrats to close it, even though it provides a happy home for many elderly people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir James Kilfedder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I endorse my hon. Friend's remarks. In December, during a debate on the Floor of the House, I appealed to the Minister in another place who is responsible for health matters in Northern Ireland that Enler house should be retained.

The Minister spoke about health service achievements dedicated staff. I pay tribute to the outstanding staff at all levels. That includes medical and nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and security staff—many of whom are needed around Belfast. Those people have been outstanding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would my hon. Friend include the lay facilitators who are setting up the trust funds?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had not got around to speaking about people in grey suits. I am talking about those involved in hands-on health care and the protection of patients. However, I take my hon. Friend's point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The city of Belfast and Northern Ireland in general has hospitals that are not only outstanding but the best in western Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In places such as Pittsburgh and Boston, biomedical technology is a major provider of employment and research. I have mentioned this to various people, including Dr. George Quigley of the Royal group of hospitals, and I should like the Government to look into this issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister praised hospitals and their staff and said that waiting lists—especially for cardiac surgery—had got shorter. I welcome that: Many people in Northern Ireland needing cardiac surgery have it performed in places in England, such as London, which is far from ideal. Northern Ireland, along with Glasgow, has the highest figures in the world when it comes to coronary arterial disease. The figures for Northern Ireland can be broken down using social class distribution. In social class groups 4 and 5, in cities such as Belfast and in inner-city areas such as the Falls road and Shankhill road, the incidence of heart disease is frightening. A number of people in their late twenties and early thirties have angina, which is the precursor of coronary trouble. That is extremely serious. Although I accept that cardiac surgery has received a fan-bit of funding, it is still not enough—bearing in mind the frightening number of people with coronary disease in Belfast alone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal group of hospitals was mentioned. I showed my hon. Friend the Member for South Down a little booklet that it produced. I commend the Royal group for producing that booklet, which is passed round all family doctors in the area. I presume that is done right across the board in other hospitals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Waiting lists for orthopaedic surgery are still far too long, especially for people who are waiting for hip replacements. Some people have been critical of the fact that the Royal Victoria is carrying out those operations. I understand that surgeons at the Royal Victoria are the same as those at the Musgrave Park hospital, so I do not see that there is a particular problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As regards administrators, I have not come here to attack the officers of the Eastern board or the management executive—unlike the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth), who talked about the men in grey suits.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: He has.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All right—I am criticising them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not one to go back into history, but the Royal Victoria was the first hospital to be made a trust. There were great celebrations by those who promoted the idea—
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
I certainly was not one of them—and much talk of what the hospital would do. Within months of that decision, the Eastern board gave a contract to the Royal Victoria which, including EMT, was for 2,000 fewer surgical episodes than previously. If that had gone through, it would have been the beginning of the end of the Royal Victoria as a general hospital, although not in terms of its acute or regional services. There was a major campaign, and I was pleased that Lord Arran did not accept the board's actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The management executive produced a document containing criteria for boards regarding buying from hospitals. The Eastern board did not keep to those criteria. My hon. Friend the Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) spoke about the lack of consultation. The decision that the board was going to steamroller through—and would have done—if there had not been a massive campaign against it—was made with no consultation with local doctors. The Minister did not accept the board's proposals, and I understand that the matter is now being considered by the review group, so I shall leave it there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that the Government can eventually force all GPs to become fundholders. I expect that to happen, 'because it does not work if half the doctors are fundholders and the other half are not. I oppose fundholding on principle, but if it is to proceed, it may be better if in time it involves everyone.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for Belfast, South that Musgrave Park hospital is one of the finest hospitals for orthopaedic surgery in western Europe—perhaps in the world. I strongly recommend any hon. Member who needs a new hip to go to Musgrave Park hospital. They measure people as if they were measuring them for a suit. The technology is out of this world.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How long does it take?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure, but it is fairly quick, and the results are outstanding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Belvoir Park hospital has been mentioned in relation to the treatment of cancer. Tragically, as in every other part of Britain and Ireland, we have high rates of various cancers in Northern Ireland. The environmental factor is the key. Hospitals have been closed for all sorts of reasons, but the idea of moving radiotherapy and chemotherapy services from Belvoir Park hospital to the Royal Victoria hospital is wrong. I worked for 30 years within 300 yards of the Royal Victoria hospital, and I believe that the unit should stay where it is. It serves the whole of the North of Ireland; and its staff provide an outstanding service and have the requisite technology and know-how.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned obstetrics earlier, and do not want to repeat myself other than to say to the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea) that there should be a moratorium on the Omagh hospital. I greatly support GP and midwifery-led obstetrics. I have pleasant memories of Malone Place hospital from years ago, which was a GP-midwife hospital. If we are to return to that direction—I hope we are—it would be ludicrous to close Omagh hospital and to threaten the other three hospitals that we mentioned earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of community health, I have the highest regard for the efficiency of the people involved in west and north Belfast at managerial and every other level, but I agree with the hon. Member for Belfast, South. I was with him at the meeting at which we discussed the draft Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1994. I hope that I am not out of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0292">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
order, Mr. Hogg, in referring to a document that I understand will be published tomorrow—the Huston report into sexual abuse. It makes 54 recommendations and I hope that the Government will act upon them as soon as possible. It reveals that there was a breakdown of communication in a number of organisations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main discussion then was not about the children order but about community trusts. We have not yet had an in-depth discussion on the children order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall now deal with nursing homes and homes for the elderly and the whole question of the elderly and mentally infirm. Everyone must know of someone—whether an aunt, uncle or grandmother—with a failing mind. It is sad to see the unmarried son or daughter in a family left to look after the elderly person. We all have examples of that in our own families or in those of our neighbours. The dedicated person—caring requires total dedication—who looks after the old man or woman for years may not have the opportunity to get married and raise his or her own family. Respite care services, to which everyone has referred, are very poor, not only in Belfast but in the Province generally. However, the Royal Victoria hospital is very good at admitting elderly people in Belfast to give temporary respite to the carers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the document leaked from the Department of Health this morning, which anticipates closing an additional 250 homes across Northern Ireland, is an indictment of the proposed care that the elderly in our community will receive? In my area, three statutory homes have already been closed. One of them was closed without the statutory permission of the former Minister, Lord Arran—he did not even know about it. That is the type of method that has been used to redistribute the elderly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend agree that we are not talking about restricting beds, but about dissipating homes? When the elderly go into residential care, they create a home atmosphere, company and security. It is not a pancea to put the elderly into the community where it is assumed that the neighbours will trot in to see them several times a day. The reality is that the elderly see no one but home helps who cook their dinner at 9 am in 30 minutes while, at the same time, they try to wash the dishes and make the fire. Does he agree that that trend has to be reversed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I totally accept what my hon. Friend says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The old person whose mind is failing and who is being looked after by the unmarried son or daughter, can become a crisis referral when the carer is breaking down and cannot take any more. All of a sudden, all arrows are pointing to the removal of that elderly person, but to where? If the old person is running around at night in his nightshirt, or disturbing neighbours, he has to be removed to an institution. The answer must be that something should be done long before we reach the stage of crisis referral. Within the community, every assistance must be given to those who are looking after the elderly or the handicapped. Great emphasis should be put on respite care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, the legislative aspects of community care for children has not been sorted out. I know that senior social workers in Belfast are most unhappy, about that. I am not an authority on the legislation and shall not, therefore, go
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
into it in detail. However, I hope that the Minister will bring my concerns to the attention of the Minister with responsibility for health.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If the Committee agrees, I am minded to extend the Committee to 1.15 p.m. I understand that I am entitled to do that, and it would permit the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents are disappointed and resentful over the decision to transfer acute services from the Moyle hospital, Larne, to the new Antrim hospital. Lame borough council, the local GPs, the Moyle action committee and the nurses action committee have the complete support of the entire community in their campaign to save the Moyle hospital. There is a strong feeling that the Northern health and social services board has not adequately responded to the 41 submissions made to it and that consultation was made almost meaningless by the lack of concessions to requests about services that might have been retained at Moyle. I take this opportunity to place on record the outstanding work, commitment and advice tendered over the years by Dr. Dunne, Mr. Eric Wright-Turner and many other community-minded individuals, who have given much time and thought to the "Save Moyle" campaign.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I ask the Minister to invite his noble Friend to attempt, even at this late stage, to accommodate the wishes of general practitioners in Larne in the interests of giving better service to the local community in that catchment area. I urge the Minister urgently to consider extending and enhancing the facilities at Larne health centre. We should also appreciate an up-to-date statement from the Northern health and social services board and from the Minister outlining the services to be provided at Larne now that the transfer of acute services from Moyle to the Antrim hospital is imminent. The board's response to local submissions stated that the board would "enter into discussions with interested parties to secure a small number of beds at the Moyle hospital for the care of people who have terminal illnesses. We should like to know what conclusions have been reached about provision for care of the terminally ill at Moyle and the result of the discussions that were promised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May we have an assurance that the promised additional accident and emergency ambulance crew will be in place at Larne before the Antrim hospital opens and that, in addition to carrying equipment to support cardiac cases, each ambulance will have a crew member trained in the advance management of pre-hospital coronary care? Some of my constituents—those most at risk in the event of heart attack—live 20 miles away from the ambulance station and would have almost 40 miles to travel to Antrim if an ambulance were called out. That presents a serious problem of delay, which, if the crew does not have expertise on board, could cause otherwise preventable death.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Larne generously supported fund-raising to provide their own cardiac car. The late Dr. Castles gave a substantial donation in the belief that there would always be a cardiac car in Larne, so I am sure that the measure of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0293">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
bitterness that that cardiac car is being removed is understood. We need confirmation that the ambulance service to be provided for the acute services transferred to Antrim will, if anything, be better than those we have had to date. We are sceptical that an ambulance will be able to travel from Larne to Antrim in 16 minutes. There may be angels of mercy on board the ambulance, but it would have to become airborne or find wings to get to Antrim from Larne in 16 minutes. I appeal to the Minister to press the noble Lord to have urgent inter-departmental discussions with the Minister for the Environment in Northern Ireland and to reach agreement for far higher priority to be given to upgrading or dualling the A8 Larne to Belfast road between Gingles's comer and Ballynure, where the road branches off to the Antrim hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of east Antrim have been well served over the years by dedicated doctors, nurses and ancillary staff whom they came to know personally at Moyle hospital. There is apprehension about the future. I trust that the Minister will ensure that there is close monitoring of change and that, if need be, the space created by the transfer of acute services to Antrim will be fully used to ensure that we have the best possible hospital and health care in my area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.50 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate, with many interesting, stimulating and constructive contributions from hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. I shall try to answer most of the questions that were asked and to comment on most of the points that were raised. Several questions were specific, individual and local, and if, by any chance, I do not cover them today, I shall ensure that hon. Members receive a letter from my noble Friend in answer to the points that they raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I say, Mr. Hogg, what a pleasure it has been to serve once again on a Committee under your chairmanship. I had forgotten the pleasure that that gives to all members of the Committee, and I thank you for the way in which you have conducted our proceedings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Normanton, for Belfast, East in an intervention, for Belfast, South and for Belfast, West referred to the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1994. The matter is to be debated in the near future in this Committee. The order has now been laid, so we should, I think, leave that matter for a full and important debate when the time comes. I hope that that debate will be as well attended as the debate this morning, as it is an important matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister assuring the Committee that we shall have that debate before any progress is made on the trust arrangements?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is likely that the debate will take place four weeks from today. As the hon. Gentleman will realise, it is suitable for the Committee to meet on a day when other business relating to Northern Ireland is discussed in the House. That will be for the convenience of most Northern Ireland Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Normanton raised several matters including the delegation legislation, and once again said that that entailed handling over statutory obligations to private bodies. I have heard the argument before, not necessarily from him, but stated by other members of his
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
party in similar debates. I reiterate what has been said by my ministerial colleagues in such debates: that the responsibilities of the state which are delegated to trusts will continue to be discharged by bodies that are wholly within the state sector. It is not a transfer to a private body. The bodies that undertake those obligations will be within the state sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The vast majority of the functions to which the hon. Gentleman referred are already carried out by board staff at local level. The only difference is that the staff carrying them out in future will, in many cases, work for trusts instead of boards, but they will essentially be the same people carrying out the same jobs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister makes an interesting point. We have been told in the House that when a trust is established, it is an independent body, free from ministerial interference, and that it is responsible to the people appointed to run it. Is the Minister saying that the trusts in Northern Ireland will be responsible to his Department or to the Department of Health in Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The trusts will be fully accountable to the boards and, ultimately, to the Department for the discharge of delegated functions, which is what the hon. Gentleman referred to in his speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the course of the speech of the hon. Member for Normanton, the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh raised the matter of consultation. I was surprised by the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that there had been no consultation with a range of bodies, including the Southern board and the Southern health and social services council. I made further inquiries of those advising me about the hon. Gentleman's questions and I understand that they related to consultation on the membership of the trust board. Where there was no consultation, I advise the hon. Gentleman that that was not unusual.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department carried out a three-month consultation on a trust application and I understand that it included Members of Parliament and the councillors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest that the Minister was at fault. Parliamentary questions are a matter of record in the House and show that I asked what were the consultations that the lay facilitator had in relation to the setting up of a trust which would include Daisy Hill hospital, and with the hon. Members for South Down and me, and with Newry and Mourne council and the Southern health board. The answer in each case was none.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I still find it impossible to believe that a trust has been set up, that a hospital is to be transferred to it and that there was no consultation between the lay facilitator and the area board under which that council is operating. Moments ago, the Minister said that those trust hospitals would ultimately be accountable to boards, yet we are told that those who set up the trusts had no consultation with the boards prior to setting them up. I want either refutation or clarification of that matter because the answer is crucial and the issue is on record in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As is so often the case, it may be a question of terminology, but I am advised that, as I said, the Department carried out full consultation over a period of three months. The Department is an entity separate from the lay facilitator about who the hon. Gentleman asked a question. There was consultation by the Department.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1993-1994V007P0I0294">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The lay facilitator was appointed by the Department to carry out the consultation. He was the agent of the Department and was specifically appointed by the Minister. The reality is that the consultation must have been carried out by the lay facilitator. That is the first point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I say that the Minister must have been misinformed. Furthermore, as one of the people involved in that hospital, I was not consulted by the Department and I gather from the reaction of my hon. Friend the Member for South Down that he was not consulted. I am not aware of the position of Newry and Mourne council, but I stick to the point that there was no consultation, even with the area board, by the lay facilitator who was appointed as the agent of the Government and the Department that was setting up the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that I can say no more at this stage. Obviously, in the light of what he said, I shall investigate the matter and write to him. I have made the position clear as I understand it, that is, that there was consultation by the Department. We could go on about the matter for a long time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be grateful if the Minister will allow me a further intervention. We have been sitting in the Room for some time and we have been told about the benefits of the Committee system—I believe in it, by the way—but earlier I asked a question, which is a matter of record, and no effort seems to have been made either to substantiate or refute it for the record. It would have been simple to find the question in 	<i>Hansard.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With respect to the hon. Gentleman, I provided him with an initial answer in the terms in which he asked the question. We then discovered that there were technical angles to the question that he had posed in the House. In the light of that, I should like to consult and write to the hon. Gentleman so that we can ensure that the information that is given to him is accurate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may have been a misunderstanding of the terms in which he posed the question this morning and the terms in which he now says that it was asked in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Mallon</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider circulating copies of the letter to other members of the Committee?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall ensure that the information that I give to the hon. Gentleman on the matter is made known to other members of the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<i>It being One o'clock,</i> THE CHAIRMAN, 	<i>pursuant to Standing Order No. 88 (Meetings of Standing Committees), deferred adjourning the Committee.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was asked about the cost of community care reforms. The Government are fully aware that that is an option that involves cost. For that reason, I was pleased to announce that more than £100 million in additional resources is being made available to boards for the provision of community care services. That reflects the Government's commitment not only to community care, but to our recognition that resources must be provided for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William O'Brien</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister tell us the period over which that £100 million will be spent?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The extra money will be spent over three years. The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster made an interesting speech, but I was a little depressed by some of his comments about the health service in Northern Ireland because they did not reflect the position properly. He suggested that standards were falling, but as I tried to make clear in my opening speech, waiting lists are becoming shorter: more patients are being treated than ever before.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to private patients and suggested that the figures created a distortion in the health service, but there are very few private patients. There are fewer than 2,000 out of 300,000 admissions a year, which puts the matter into perspective. Additional funding of £10 million is targeted at waiting lists. I know that the hon. Gentleman is a fair man, so I hope that he will accept that standards are improving. That is due not only to the Government's efforts but to efforts within the health service, which I am sure he would want to recognise as much as I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that we owe a tremendous debt to those who work in the health service. They carry out .their duties diligently and expertly in difficult circumstances. If the Minister was alarmed at what I said about change, he will have to offer tremendous enlightenment to the hon. Member for North Down.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not alarmed, but disappointed. It is sometimes easy to suggest in such debates that everything is gloomy and going downhill, but many instances over the past few years show that the health service has been significantly improved in Northern Ireland and that the service being provided to patients has also improved. I know that there is always a temptation to knock—it is easy to do that—but it is important to recognise improvements and in doing so, we reflect our admiration for the work carried out by those in the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South referred to the Ulster hospital trust. The hon. Member for Belfast, East also referred to it in an intervention. I said that that matter was being reviewed and that the trust is rethinking its need for capital investment. The management is now awaiting revised proposals and we must wait for those before commenting.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I raised the important issue of maternity services, and especially a moratorium, which has been supported by all the hon. Members who have spoken in the debate. Particular reference was made to Mid-Ulster and South Down. Surely, we need a reply on that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In my opening remarks, I spoke at some length about maternity services. I had hoped not to go into detail as I may be able to answer points in correspondence. However, I shall answer some of the new questions raised, rather than those with which I dealt earlier. Unless the hon. Gentleman wishes, I do not intend to return to the matter of Tyrone County hospital—other than to point out, as I did before, that much consideration was given to it. I am reminded of the delegations that were received and the representations that were considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McGrady</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The point made by the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster encompasses maternity services policy, as distinct from the detail. Will the Minister comment on the policy on throughput, new investigations and the inquiries taking place?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to go over ground that I have already covered. A paragraph in my speech dealt with that matter, but I could expand on it. I made it clear that the Department announced the setting up of an independent study group to consider the development of maternity units, including those that the hon. Member for Belfast, South welcomed, led by midwives or general practitioners. The formation of that group demonstrates the importance attached to maintaining and improving maternity services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the forthcoming meeting between the hon. Member for South Down and my noble Friend Lady Denton. The hon. Gentleman will have the opportunity to make specific representations in that context. I hope that I have covered those points. I am conscious of the time, and hon. Members will realise that I want to deal with the speeches made. That would be courteous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Belfast, South and for North Down referred to management—the so-called men in grey suits. A 1991 survey revealed that 56 per cent. of managers and administrators engaged in patient-related work that released commisssions for direct patient care. A review of purchasing services structures has been commissioned, to ensure the most effective and efficient use of staff. The management executive will continue to examine carefully management costs throughout the service, including in trusts, to ensure that the maximum amount of money is devoted directly to patient and client care. That is the purpose behind the Government's intentions. I assure the hon. Member for North Down that although the position may not be totally as we would like, we shall continue to make efforts to improve it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir James Kilfedder</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister ensure that we have full disclosure, which is something that I asked for today and on previous occasions, in relation to the Eastern health board headquarters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will certainly refer the hon. Gentleman's remarks to my noble Friend, and will ask her to write to the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of fewer nurses. Overall nursing staff levels fell from 17,804 in January 1990 to 15,626 in September 1993—a reduction of 12 per cent. That can be explained largely by the falling numbers of traditional nursing students who are employees and the introduction of the Project 2000 nurse training programme, under which students receive a bursary and are not classified as employees. In the same period, however, the number of trained nursing staff in the NHS has remained relatively static.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Do those figures include trained nurses in the private residential and nursing sectors, or only nurses in the national health service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ancram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that those figures cover only the latter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South raised the important issue of the closure of residential homes. A number of statutory residential homes for the elderly have
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
closed in the past two years or are currently being considered for closure. There role is a matter for the individual board involved, but when a proposed closure or change of use is likely to be controversial, the board's decision is subject to ministerial approval.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend Lord Arran has given careful consideration in the past to many proposed closures, and my noble Friend Lady Denton asked me to say that she will examine closely further proposals that are submitted to her. In doing so, she will want to ensure that, as far as possible, elderly people will be helped to stay in their homes for as long as possible. I am sure that we all share that aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That means that the numbers of elderly people in residential homes will decline and that, in turn, some of those homes must be closed if they are no longer viable. However, let me stress that if an elderly person needs residential care, that care will be available. That is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South, referred to appointment times and waiting. Patients are given individual appointment times at outpatients departments; .and 79 per cent, of patients are seen within 30 minutes of their appointment time. We could perhaps discuss that at length, but it shows that the Government are anxious for improvements to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that I do not have time to cover all issues raised, but either I or my noble Friend Lady Denton will write to hon. Members on those that have not been dealt with. I listened with care and attention to the hon. Member for Belfast, West, and share his anxiety about coronary disease. I am sure that he appreciates that within the past two years, the number of cardiac surgeons at the Royal have increased from three to five. That reflects the desire of the health service to ensure that proper provision is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand the anxiety of the hon. Member for Antrim, East, over the closure of Moyle and that some people in the area have found the changes difficult to accept. However, I believe that the high quality and improved range of services at Antrim will soon banish their disappointment at the loss of their local acute services. The hon. Gentleman raised the question of accident and emergency ambulances at Larne. They will continue to be located at Larne and DaUymena, and one additional ambulance will be provided at Larne. I assure the hon. Gentleman that he will receive answers to his specific questions about Larne.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the opportunity to respond as fully as I could to the debate. It is important for Northern Ireland to discuss such matters and I am grateful to all hon. Members who contributed interventions or speeches, to the debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
