	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed [18 February</i>],
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report that the Committee has considered the matter of the public expenditure plans for Northern Ireland for 1997–98/1999–2000.—[	<i>Sir John Wheeler</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<i>Question again proposed</i>.</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Committee last met I raised the question of the figures that were given by my right hon. Friend the Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor) about births in the Ulster hospital compared with those in the City hospital. As there might be some dispute about the figures, to clarify the issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend gave round figures and claimed that births last year in the Ulster hospital and the City hospital were about 2,000 in each place. In fact, in 1995, in the Jubilee, the maternity section of the City hospital, there were 2,584 births compared with 1,761 in the Ulster hospital. In 1996, there were 2,764 births in the Jubilee compared with 1,894 in the Ulster hospital.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not here to argue against the Ulster hospital. In my role as the Ulster Unionist health spokesman I seek to be fair and represent health needs and sort out the problems. However, as the Member for Belfast, South I have a remit to look after the services in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am thankful for the funding that has been given. However, some questions need to be asked and, during the appropriations debate, I raised the question of how we spend our money. In one particular hospital, there is a plan for a building, costing about £1 million, to house medical records. That plan could be replicated in other hospitals. However, people in information technology tell me that such records could be stored much more efficiently and cost-effectively in a modern computer system that would not cost £1 million and would not take up the same amount of space.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had experience of medical records when I visited hospitals on chaplaincy calls. Each week, I tried to get a record of the admissions of patients with Presbyterian backgrounds. Quite often, I discovered that members of my own congregation were patients, yet I had been given no record of them. As I had just begun the work there, it was rather embarrassing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
A problem with waiting lists is inaccurate medical record-keeping. It is important for records to be kept well. Perhaps in future patients will carry their own records and X-rays and be responsible for them, which may obviate some of them going missing. I referred to medical reports during a debate in the House on 5 March. Column 823 of the 	<i>Official Report</i> contains that reference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister guarantee that the health management executive and the Department are in control of their own budgets and on top of the job? I reiterate the question that I posed during the debate in the House last week. The Ulster hospital trust approached the Department in February 1995 for permission to consult on the best ways of dealing with problems in the hospital. Why did it take one year, until February 1996, for a response to be given? Consultation was carried out with the University of Wales, which largely agreed with the trust's view. What happened? The Department decided to amalgamate two trusts and I question whether that decision will deal with the basic problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that there will be an attempt to put in new management. That may be an improvement, but the University of Wales recommended downsizing the hospital, which was the trust board's understanding. The trust has already lost a chief executive and two chairmen and one wonders whether that poses another problem, especially as some £300,000 was spent in that trust on redundancies, and a large proportion of the money was cleverly spent on arranged pensions. Will there be another large outpouring of public funds and redundancy payments with no positive advantage as the real problems have not been tackled?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the difficulties of the calculations and suggestions has been to understand the figures. Some years ago I discovered that when accountants draw up accounts for companies they often use figures to conceal rather than reveal. It can be exceedingly difficult for an amateur to understand what is happening. Is the Minister satisfied that changes have taken place in the Department of Health and Social Services, and the trust board and other bodies associated with it, in the light of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which referred to general weaknesses in controls and procedures? In his report dated 28 August 1996, he concluded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"My reviews have found a large number of the weaknesses are widespread in a number a bodies and they often recur in other bodies in subsequent years."</p></blockquote>
I wonder what has happened. I have noticed a pattern. When the Public Accounts Committee deals with public accounts and representatives from Departments not only in Northern Ireland but over here come before it, it discovers that another civil servant is answering for past failures and promising to be better in future—but the same things recur. Have we sufficiently tightened up the controls that are so important if public funds are to be used properly and beneficially.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0614">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
I find the concept of the top slice and how it is used difficult to work out. One discovered last week's appropriations that some £ 14 million was carried over from last year as part of the £50 million available for this year, which is about to end—the new financial year begins in April. Why was £14 million in the kitty carried over in the health spend when there were cries for funds in different Departments in the preceding year? Why has there been a long delay in the development of the Causeway trust? I may not be a financial expert but I know that prices rarely go down and building costs regularly go up. With the fall in the London market, property prices may have gone down for a few years but that pattern is not normal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money might have been better spent at that time to meet needs instead of having such a large underspend. Will the Minister say from whence came the £3.5 million that was put in the kitty and, more latterly, the £5.2 million? I have heard conflicting responses to that question and I should like clarification about whether the £3.5 million came from the underspend in a previous year or was diverted from the industrial development budget in the current financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How we spend the money now will guide us as to how we project our figures in future. Although the Secretary of State said in his statement that, in the health budget, he was providing.
	<br><blockquote><p>"an additional £56 million over the present year; an increase of 3.5 per cent. in cash terms on 1996–97 plans",</p></blockquote>
will not subsequent years show a decrease in real terms?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that health demands will continue to increase with the demographic pattern and with improved technology. How can we help to meet those needs if we reduce the real terms budget? In cash terms that may look fine but, although we are aware that, thankfully, normal inflation has been retained at a lower rate for some time and we appreciate the economic controls that the Government have pushed forward, is not it a fact that, even with low inflation, health inflation is still higher than normal inflation? That means a real terms cut in the health budget over the coming year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the wider field of social security, is the Minister aware of questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker) has asked about the Central Services Agency, its benefits and the use of its resources? There may be a pattern: one can understand that people like to get away from their telephones and that it is nice to go to a conference at Slieve Donard. I appreciate that hotels throughout the Province offer lower rates to attract conferences at certain times. On the other hand, are not places available for conferences within health facilities? For example, I know of facilities within South Tyrone hospital, Dungannon, where I spoke at a nurses' conference. Catering was
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
laid on and everything else was available. Is it necessary always to go to commercial sources when such facilities could be used?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a tendency for taking far too many senior people away regularly to all sorts of conferences. Often I wonder whether they ever have time to give guidance to those on the ground. I am speaking from the experience of trying to contact people. I recognise the need to update and have conferences but wonder whether it has got out of control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The budget mentions taking £27,348,000 for GP fundholders but £26,453,000 has been designated for them. I have two points on that. First, we are given no guidance on where almost £1 million has gone. To some of us, £1 million is a fair sum and it would be helpful to know how that was used. Secondly, is the Minister concerned that enough is being done to control the Northern Ireland drugs budget? It is a source of tremendous expenditure and one recognises that some doctors prescribe new drugs that are more expensive, although they argue, with some justification, that the outcomes are more effective and use of such drugs may be cheaper in the long run.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Do we have advanced controls and mechanisms for comparative peer prescription? I do not believe that we do. At a recent encounter with people from the Department, I asked whether Northern Ireland was involved in Prodigy. My question raised eyebrows and I was asked what Prodigy was. I have a problem with Prodigy, because in the Right it stands for rational and I find it difficult to understand that a machine can be rational when it is made by humans, who are often irrational. However, Prodigy is being considered by the main Department of Health, yet the Department in Northern Ireland seems unaware of it. Someone there may be aware of it, but I am not aware of him or her. All the answers that I got when I mentioned it were strained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have been arguing for the Criminal Justice (Children) (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 and have been assured that finance is being made available for it. In implementing it, there will be a need for a Guardian Ad Litem Agency. Some £500,000 was set aside for that agency in the last financial year, but it seems to have been left out of the latest appropriations. In other words, it has been cancelled. Are we running behind time, or is this a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul by not providing the safeguards that the Children Order requires? I challenge that decision, particularly because of our growing awareness of the enormity of child abuse in Northern Ireland and the large number of cases in the Province, which some say are only the tip of the iceburg. Why was that sum reduced in the supplementary estimates?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
May I raise another problem to do with social care? The document "Health and Wellbeing: Into the Next Millennium" deals with the regional strategy for health and social well-being 1997–2002— the period we are considering. It says:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"During the period of the strategy Boards and Trusts should continue with their programmes for the implementation of all the recommendations in the report."</p></blockquote>
One recommendation in "Dementia in Northern Ireland", a report on dementia policy scrutiny, is that there should be a clear commitment to
	<br><blockquote><p>"the early establishment of a dementia development centre in Northern Ireland as part of an overall strategy to develop and improve dementia services."</p></blockquote>
The dementia service has the support of virtually every group working in that sector, both voluntary and statutory, to deal with what is a basic and growing problem. Yet we discover that finances from the centre have not been made available to carry on that strategy as finances from trusts and trust boards are built up. Why are we still waiting to move forward at that level? Is it part of a game, in light of the decisions by education boards this year to withdraw funding for summer schemes for mentally handicapped people? Is that again a reflection of our willingness to penalise those who cannot shout for themselves while allowing those who are better equipped to reap the prize? I press the Minister on that issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the rates question, the Minister's press statement in response to the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea) pointed out that the comparison between the allowance for the English areas was not equitable. As the target was for a £ 10,000 limit in 1990, does the Minister not accept that, seven years on, there is a case to be made for at least some increase on that basic amount? Bearing in mind that the Minister is aware that small businesses suffer most because, pro rata, rates have a bigger effect both on their running costs and outcome as a whole, I ask for attention to be given to that problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point concerns job training. We thank those who have worked to bring more jobs to Northern Ireland. Admittedly, a high percentage of those new jobs are part time and therefore affect semi-retired people or mothers who want part-time employment. We have not dented the long-term problem and we still have a high number of unemployed. I was amazed yesterday to discover that there is a high percentage of unemployed teachers and health workers in the Province. There are those who argue that we should reduce the number of pupils in classes to make the situation more equitable and that we should be doing more in the primary sector. I notice that the nursery voucher scheme has been delayed for another year, which will again hit the education sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am more worried about training. It is not the wisest use of finance in relation to Action for Community Employment to reduce job training to about 2,000 places and job skills courses to 2,000—adult training places have also been reduced. We have not been told where the money will go instead. Those people will have to be financed from another source. Some savings might be made, but is that saving commensurate with the loss that will occur? Those people's skills will not
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
be honed to enable them to find work. For instance, graduates have academic training, but they do not have a clue about the workplace. Some of them found the ACE scheme very helpful in bridging that gap.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who have been in long-term unemployment and who are seeking to return to employment are also relevant. We used to hear the old cry that they should be given a brush or a spade and sent to clean the ditches, but anyone who has ever used a spade would never make that recommendation. If a person who had not done manual work for a period were sent out with a spade, that would certainly reduce the unemployment figures, but he would not be fit to do the work. Other jobs would be more suitable, and appropriate schemes are what is needed to raise the standards in ACE and in relation to social input. People would be able to provide back-up in the community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I fear that the Government have not fully understood the fact that the real difficulty is that there may not be enough trainers or managers in core training positions to train the residue. Cutting down on trainers lessens the effectiveness of the work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the issues unfold, I must make an appeal that I have repeated on many occasions. When are we going to have a clear decision about the acute hospital rationalisation programme? The delay is causing deep concern, and the sooner the matter is dealt with the better. I shall not argue at present for any one scheme, but the uncertainty is problematic. I have my own views about where money could be saved and services provided, and I should be prepared to enter into a debate about the various pros and cons. Uncertainty about the future should be removed so that trust boards can plan their services in a proper economy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: May I register my concern about the planned reduction of £2 million in roads expenditure for Northern Ireland? We need increased funding in the roads budget, not cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is disappointing to people in East Antrim that the dualling and improvement of the A8 Larne to Belfast road were not considered worthy of inclusion in the list of planned new major roadworks. If we have to wait for a private finance initiative to get improvements to roads, passing opportunities or roundabouts, we shall have to wait for a long time. The A8 is part of the trans-European network, and it is important that in planning public expenditure, Her Majesty's Government also seek to maximise the opportunity to attract European funding. That road in particular is a problem because of the high percentage of heavy goods vehicles and the increase in heavy traffic that is predicted will result from the expansion of F. G. Wilson's factories in Larne, Monkstown and Springvale in Belfast. That will increase road traffic hazards for all other users on the Larne to Belfast road where there is already congestion, where there are no
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>47</span>
passing opportunities for more than six miles and where there is extreme danger and difficulty for motorists trying to get access to the A8 at Millbrook and at Antville in Larne during peak traffic periods.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fall in traffic on the route, following the relocation of Sealink to Belfast from Larne, has been reversed. Larne harbour reports steady business growth due to the success of the Jetliner and the reliability and frequency of sailings to and from Larne. We must have increased expenditure in future on the roads programme. The closure of Moyle hospital at Larne and the necessity for seriously ill patients to get to Antrim or Belfast hospitals safely and quickly should be borne in mind when future road schemes for Northern Ireland are being prioritised and PFI funding is being organised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must have early investment, provision and funding for the development of roads throughout the Carrickfergus borough area, where there has been a rapid expansion in private housing. The A2, which we expected would be improved several years ago, is no longer on the list for planned future expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the existing roads funding should be directed at enforcement action against developments who fail to make up roads and footpaths or who fail to provide proper drainage, sewerage, services and sites. The time may have come to appoint additional personnel within planned expenditure and to make additional funding available to the Department of the Environment. Perhaps higher value bonds should be demanded from contractors so that if they default, that money, held by the Department of the Environment, could be used to make good any deficit that has arisen, without causing unnecessary inconvenience to residents of developed estates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is widespread concern throughout the Province that the reduction in planned expenditure has brought about a draconian cut in our roads gritting programme. People feel that decisions were taken without consultation. There is now an increased risk of accident to motorists in rural areas and to school children travelling in buses along untreated roads. There have been many rural school closures in order to use more effectively the funding that is available for education. Now, roads are not gritted and children from those rural areas will be unable to get to school, so there should be adequate provision in planned road expenditure to permit increased road gritting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister advise me later so that I may allay some of the concerns expressed by my constituents? For example, how many vehicles are taxed in Northern Ireland, and what is the total value of road tax collected and the estimated value of fuel tax paid? How does the income from road tax and fuel tax compare with the spending on new roads, maintenance and winter gritting?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>48</span>
If there is insufficient funding in the existing budget, will the Minister consider making provision for additional staffing within the Roads Service so that there will at least be an opportunity for officers to identify areas as they traverse the roads where hedges and trees are so overgrown that they are hazardous to motorists and drivers of heavy goods vehicles? Perhaps those additional officers could identify areas where water flows from adjacent land on to the roads, which creates stretches of black ice in winter, causing serious problems. We need a more urgent and aggressive approach to the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the provision for expenditure on industry, trade, energy and employment. We welcome the encouragement given to overseas investors and acknowledge the success in attracting new investment, and we pay tribute to the Under-Secretary for her efforts and success. More and more people are benefiting from the healthy state of the economy and the continuing fall in unemployment. However, like my fellow colleagues from Northern Ireland, I must record my opposition to the policy of cutting back expenditure on Action for Community Employment schemes, which have provided training opportunities for long-term unemployed people and worthwhile services to the most vulnerable in our community. If the core management posts are lost, the scheme will collapse and I am not aware of a satisfactory alternative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the moneys voted to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, we cannot just congratulate ourselves on the excellence of our schools and the achievement of our students at all levels, because the massive cuts projected in the education budget will have a damaging impact on our education provision. To demand continuing annual savings by area boards will threaten the ability of those boards to provide services that are necessary in the long term. There is already serious underfunding of the boards and of schools, colleges and universities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The provision of nursery places in Northern Ireland is the worst of all regions of the United Kingdom. It is important that the Minister tells us as soon as possible that additional funding for nursery provision will be reinstated. We all recognise that the cuts imposed will reduce planned expenditure on the youth service, libraries, discretionary awards, post-graduate student awards and discretionary support for teachers embarking on courses to obtain additional qualifications. We regret that. It is disgraceful.

This year's capital allocation for new school projects appears—for the first time, I think—to discriminate against the controlled sector. In future, funding should be balanced between the controlled and maintained sectors. In urging close scrutiny of future funding of capital projects in Northern Ireland, we ask for fairness. We were appalled that despite all the enthusiasm for integrated education we could not find
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>49</span>
funding even for a new gymnasium at a school at Crumlin in county Antrim where there is excellent integrated schooling. That would be basic provision for more than 400 pupils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A serious distortion arises in the budget from the social deprivation factor based on the uptake of free school meals. That causes concern between primary schools and between secondaries. There is great disparity between provision for controlled and maintained sector schools in the same catchment areas. Equating free school meals with low academic achievement when it comes to distributing funds to schools is most unsatisfactory. Money follows pupils selected at 11-plus to go to grammar school. Those identified as having high academic potential have more money going to them. But that can happen only if the money is taken away from some other sector. That system should be replaced as soon as possible with a fairer system to allocate funds to pupils in all sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must make sure that the education budget provides adequate support to schools in the border areas where the Protestant community has been under continuous attack for years. Families have been driven out, and that threatens remaining school provision and the whole community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all conscious of the need adequately to fund law and order. However, if my sums are right, the increased allocation of £76 million and the corresponding cut of £55 million in education provision are difficult to justify. That cut will cause serious damage to eduction. The real culprit which should accept responsibility for cuts in education is Sinn Fein-IRA, which must no longer be permitted to damage the educational prospects of our children and students and to destroy our society. At the same time, because of the vast sums that have been allocated to the law and order budget, it would be appropriate for a sound value-for-money study to be carried out as to whether the most effective use is being made of available resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At all levels, parents, students, teachers and school governors feel anxiety and apprehension about the impact of those rather vindictive cuts. I hope those cuts have nothing to do with the fact that widespread public support dissuaded the Minister from his mission to reduce the five boards to three. Only time will tell, however, but larger class sizes, teacher redundancies, and reduced employment expectations for those students at university and in training colleges all paint a black picture for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Within the funding announced for education there is provision for health and personal social services. I request a direction for urgent collaboration between education boards and health and personal social services staff so that, in the coming year, the existing unsatisfactory arrangements for tube-feeding children in our special schools can be corrected. If those two bodies got together, they could arrange for staff
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>50</span>
training for those in special schools to ensure that, when a severely handicapped child arrives at school, the parent who has brought that child to school with a reasonable expectation of a small respite during the day may have that. That parent should not be required to cancel all other arrangements to return to the school to feed his or her child because of the absence or shortage of trained staff. It is appaling that that should happen. With a direction from the relevant Ministers that situation could and should be resolved urgently. Parents of severely handicapped children would consider such an allocation of funding to be appropriate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am deeply worried about the public expenditure cuts that are outlined in the documents. I do not see how we can be pressing for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland without tackling its economic and social problems, which are the breeding ground for the development of extremist views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In real terms, overall public expenditure has been cut. Page 1 of the summary document shows an increase in cash terms. I am sure that some Conservative Members would argue that they are increasing expenditure in Northern Ireland. That is unfortunately, the nature of political discourse in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The correct figures are those that take inflation into account. In real terms, there are clear public expenditure cuts of £296 million—3.7 per cent.—over a three-year period up to the new millennium. That is far greater than the extra funds being redirected to the law and order programme. I do not think that expenditure on the law and order programme should be taken into account when considering the rest of public expenditure, but when it is, non-law and order public expenditure is worse hit than the total amount. Although, the move to extra expenditure on law and order occurs in the coming year and slips back a little after that, there is an overall increase on last year's expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1997–98, the overall reduction of £122 million in real terms is greater that the amount allocated for law and order, although the law and order element is larger in that period. That reinforces the point that the cuts cannot be blamed wholly or even mainly on law and order. They are part of a general decision to cut expenditure in, for example, education, as the previous speaker made clear. Education should not have that burden placed on it. Hitting education will affect the future of Northern Ireland—its young people and how they can link and develop together in peace and reconciliation—and will allow historical circumstances to be used by extremists to breed a new generation who may find themselves in conflict with each other. We should be concerned about that.

The transfer of spending in favour of law and order and industrial development programmes rather than employment and training programmes runs counter to the third public expenditure priority explained on page 6 of the document "Targeting Social Need". The failure of the Industrial Development Board, the Government's primary agency for creating more jobs, to make any contribution to the 1995 "Policy Appraisal and Fair Treatment" report is of great significance. The £20 million cut in the 1997–98 budget of the Training and Employment Agency will seriously undermine its capacity to achieve its aims and objectives and, in particular, to focus on targeting social need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Raising the skills of the work force is of key importance. The cut of £10 million—2,000 places—in the Jobskills programme will seriously impede the achievement of that objective. The cut of £11 million–12,000 places—in Action for Community Employment, coming on top of the substantial cut in the current financial year, will result in the programme's much reduced capacity to offer temporary employment to long-term unemployed. The closure of the Dundonald training centre, coupled with the closure of the Boucher Road training centre, leaves a gap in training provision in east and south Belfast and large parts of North Down and Ards. It is essential that the agency should have the resources to deal with that gap in a way that meets the needs of people in those areas. The reduction in the budget for the company development programme will weaken the agency's ability to support inward investment for the Province. There have been some important developments recently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cut in the budget for Enterprise Ulster will seriously curtail its ability to upgrade the work force's skills. The proposals include a reduction in housing expenditure, and rent increases will be imposed on tenants of the Housing Executive. The Housing Executive's experience of developing housing in Northern Ireland is important, and all sections of the community have argued for housing developments. The Government's ideology is that they should be generally involved in housing developments, but that affects the situation in Northern Ireland. The proposals include reductions in expenditure on youth service, libraries and discretionary educational grants, which we discussed earlier. There is not enough spending on pre-school education, and expenditure on roads will be reduced. Responsibility for schools' estate may be avoided by seeking to lay the burden on the private finance initiative. The administrative expenditure of the education and library boards' headquarters will be reduced and there will be cuts at the horticultural and plant breeding station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of those developments are seriously detrimental to efforts to tackle Northern Ireland's problems. Given the poverty and unemployment levels in Northern
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>52</span>
Ireland, we should pay serious attention to the argument for increased expenditure in those areas, irrespective of the problem of violence in Northern Ireland. In light of the situation in Northern Ireland, that increased expenditure is a political imperative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I often feel that the Northern Ireland Office is hamstrung by the Conservative party's ideological policies, which affect public expenditure. Advances have been made in other areas, and I support many of them—they attempt to draw people together. It is important for such measures not to go off at half cock; we should encourage proper developments, which should ensure that people are readily and easily drawn together. The Government's approach undermines the many efforts that are under way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A response to my argument might be to ask what the Labour party's position is. Is it committed to the limits on public expenditure that the Conservatives have imposed? The first year's expenditure that is listed in the documents would be affected. Labour has argued that it is hard for a future Labour Government to readjust entirely the programmes that are under way. Commitments to public expenditure programmes may hold for a couple of years or so, but the possibility of redirection begins to apply after that. For example, in my country there will be alterations in the standard spending assessment formulae so that moneys can be redistributed from other parts of the country to Derbyshire. Likewise, some Committee members must feel that similar developments will affect the public expenditure programme for Northern Ireland. If moneys are redistributed under the general total in the second year, Northern Ireland's demands will rank highly. I hope that Labour's programmes for job creation and for advancing the economy will begin to take hold after that date and that we shall be in a position to deliver more in relation to public expenditure without necessarily doing anything at that stage to alter tax levels—although doing so would bring in more resources, enabling us to take effective action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Labour party has an exciting policy to offer to the people of Northern Ireland. The paradox is that we cannot go there to present our policy and let those people vote Labour at the coming election. Our policies are appropriate to Northern Ireland and would begin to tackle the problems of public expenditure, despite the difficulties. We can be rightly proud of offering those policies to the people of Britain, but they should be offered also to the people of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If there is a Labour Government—as I hope there will be—next year's discussion on public expenditure should be of considerable interest. There will still be needs and concerns expressed about the impact of cuts, which must be pushed in a different direction. The needs of the people of Northern Ireland—their opportunities for work and eduction and their ability to build decent communities in which to intermingle—is of overriding importance to the policies that we should adopt in relation to the Province.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

William McCrea 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Mid-Ulster)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an important debate because we are identifying many of the problems that we face, not only in this year's budget but as we head towards the millennium. I understand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Budget that he would keep public spending within tight limits and reduce overall national spending over the next three years. Unfortunately, we have major concerns when we see those figures and see the impact that they will have on the lives of people in Northern Ireland over the next three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concur with the points raised by the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) and appreciate his personal commitment to raising these issues time and again. His voice will be of great importance in pushing Labour Front-Bench Members to make a commitment to the people of Northern Ireland. If Labour forms the next Government of the United Kingdom, it will not be easy to deal in generalities; they will have to be specific, and we shall be targeting finances within the budget in the Province. Let us be honest and say that when we consider public expenditure for 1997–98 and 1999–2000, we believe that certain important areas demand more finance from the Exchequer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told that change has come about because of IRA violence and disturbances in the Province. But when people are going through troublesome times, it is important to support, rather than penalise, them in their time of trouble. Whether that is a pastor or in the political field, I believe that we should give succour and help all the more when someone is in trouble. We are faced with a violent campaign of terror against the people of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider what has happened. The people of the United Kingdom have come through two deep recessions. There is no doubt that we have had to tighten our belts. The people of Northern Ireland have also suffered 25 years of terrorist armed slaughter and continuing murder of our people. However, after all that, we shall suffer more than people in other parts of the United Kingdom because, we are told, we face a terrorist situation. People who work in education, health and different aspects of public expenditure and the public service tell us that we face more stringent cutbacks than ever. Something must be seriously

wrong. We are suffering because of a general need for cutback and the Chancellor's policy of keeping public spending within tight limits and reducing overall national spending plans over the next three years. On top of that, however, the terrorist campaign means that we shall be hurt further. We are told that £132 million will come off all other expenditure—out of the block grant—over a three-year period. That money could be spent on agriculture, industry, roads and housing, and on improving the environment. The United Kingdom as a whole must tighten its belt but we must suffer further cuts and a terrorist campaign—which we have endured with courage and determination over the past 25 to 30 years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
When Gerry Adams unmasked himself in County Meath and spoke to his party workers without realising that anyone else would know what was going on, he revealed that there had been a concerted effort and determined plan to cause civil strife—be it on the Garvaghy Road, in Bellaghy, on the Ormeau road, in Pomeroy or elsewhere. Piece by piece the jigsaw was completed: the civil strife had been deliberately planned and manufactured by Sinn Fein. The people who should suffer are those who vote for Sinn Fein, not the vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland. If Sinn Fein supporters want all this unrest, they should suffer the consequences of Sinn Fein's sin and crime. The tragedy, however, is that moneys have been taken away from the vast majority of the people of Northern Ireland—across the whole community—who are good, law-abiding and decent. That is disgusting and should be condemned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The cuts impact on every group of people in Northern Ireland—be they old-age pensioners, school children or young people at universities or looking for employment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman's assertion that the mask has been pulled off Gerry Adams. For a long time, it was common knowledge
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>56</span>
that the Sinn Fein organisation was, to a greater or lesser extent, behind incidents in Garvaghy road and elsewhere. However, that takes nothing away from the important findings of the North report and the fact that many people in Northern Ireland who do not support Sinn Fein object, sometimes strongly, to specific marches. Most marches are not a problem, but some are. That is an important principle and it is important that the Government and the incoming Administration accept the findings of the North report.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. William McCrea</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention, but I do not agree with some of his sentiments. I have lived in a mixed community, but my mum was reared in Ardboe, which was certainly not a mixed community; it was predominantly a republican nationalist community. People in that community accepted certain happenings and did not stick their necks out. Desertmartin is almost 100 per cent. Protestant, but the Ancient Order of Hibernians has walked down the street in Desertmartin.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a law and order element in everything that we are discussing today and if there was a good, genuine relationship within the community, the problems would not arise. I remember from my youngest days in Stewartstown, which was predominantly a nationalist town, that there were good community relations and when the Orangemen walked through the town there was no problem whatever. When the Hibernians walked through Desertmartin there was no problem. This year, I stood with my constituents in Desertmartin and I knew that they would not cause a problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It may take 10 minutes for a parade to pass and anyone who has a difficulty with it could go into the back kitchen, make a cup of tea and the parade would be over, but people wantonly and deliberately stand outside and cause community strife. That is what happened in the likes of Ormeau road and Garvaghy road. The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland want none or that, but many of them dare not open their mouths to say so because the heat might be put on them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are suffering the impact of the Chancellor's statement that public expenditure must be kept within tight limits, with an overall reduction in the next three years. The vast majority of people in Northern Ireland are not responsible for the terrorism and the extra expenditure on law and order, but they do not have the power to do anything about that. The Government have the authority and the right to give the people of Northern Ireland the protection and Civil liberties that they should have and which people in the rest of the United Kingdom have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are discussing real cuts and those real cuts are causing real hurt. If the Labour party becomes the Government, they will have to deal with the problem of cuts. It is useless condemning only Conservative Governments. If a Labour Government want to make a

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>57</span>
difference, they will have to come up with the money. It is not good enough to sit in opposition and condemn. They will have to deal with the problems and the only way of doing so will be to bring funding back to the public expenditure of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, there is little good news in our debate today. I appreciate the moneys that have been given and I have always held to the principle of value for money, as I said in the House during the appropriation debate last Wednesday. I do not believe in wasting money because that is not in the national interest. Every pound should be spent properly, honourably and decently and the best value should be obtained. We are discussing millions of pounds being taken from different parts of the community which urgently need that funding. That is what I want to discuss.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must express appreciation of the excellent work of the Minister responsible for economic development. We should make no mistake about the fact that her portfolio was not easy. Her task was not easy during the terrorist campaign, when there was a conspiracy to overthrow the state, and it was not easy to go to other parts of the world to try to attract industry. However, Baroness Denton went out and made an excellent job of bringing in foreign investors; she also did much to encourage industrial development in Northern Ireland. It would be churlish and wrong of any Member from Northern Ireland to say otherwise. She has championed the cause of encouraging industrialists to come to Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, not enough foreign investment came to my constituency, although I appreciate the good news that the firm of Copeland will come to Cockstown—that excellent company will bring valuable jobs to my constituency. It would be wrong to suggest that not enough work has been done, but much more hard work is still to be done—central and local government and Members of Parliament must work together to present the best package to encourage industrialists to come to our Province. The financial constraints will be difficult over the next few years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In our efforts to encourage foreign investment, we have to consider new approaches. For example, a minus figure applies in relation to roads and transport expenditure, as other Committee members have said. In the west of the Province, we have suffered years of neglect. Research conducted by the Northern Ireland Office shows that roads maintenance in other areas has moved forward, but that in the west of the Province, it has moved backwards. That is an intolerable situation. How are we supposed to encourage industrialists from across the world to come to the west of the Province, which is far from seaports and airports? A good road network in that area is essential. What have we got instead? We have towns that are chock-a-block.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The schemes that have been deferred from the programme that was announced in February 1996 have been listed. The Omagh through pass, the Garvaghy-
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>58</span>
Omagh road and the Toome bypass have been delayed. How are we supposed to face the challenge of the European market—and other challenges—if the Toome bypass and similar projects are not built? That bypass was never more needed than it is today, but it has been deferred. People coming from Belfast to the Magherafelt district council area have to sit in Toome in a traffic jam that is miles long. That is absolutely immoral and disgusting, and something has to be done urgently about it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What has the Department of the Environment done? It has not helped the situation—it has made it 10 times worse. It put a small roundabout in the middle of Toomebridge and ensured that the line of traffic would be longer than it ever was before. Anyone who travels through that village knows that it is the main artery to the west of the Province. The matter should be dealt with. However, we have been told that the A6 Toome bypass has been delayed because of public expenditure cuts. The community in Magherafelt faces that problem although we need the bypass because of industrial development. It would help us and people in the Cookstown area, where people travel to the airports or seaports. We need money to deal with those matters. We need the Magherafelt and the Cookstown bypasses if those areas are going to get out of the depths of the depression that they have been in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are talking about an area with massive unemployment—it is not an area with high employment—from which it has suffered over the years. My area cannot move forward because we do not have the finances from the Department to meet its needs. We must make progress on the roads and transport budget, and we need to do that now, not in the future. I hope that Ministers will take that on board and, when they tell us how concerned they are about the problems, see whether they can put their money where their mouth is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another major issue is education. The analysis of expenditure shows that, once again, there is a serious problem with education, and two matters in particular concern me. The first involves the voucher scheme for pre-school children. The children of Northern Ireland have been denied something that the rest of the United Kingdom has been given. Why are not the people of Northern Ireland getting the finance that have been provided for the rest of the kingdom? The money has not been made available to us. That matter must be faced and corrected forthwith.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second education matter that concerns me is the serious problem of cuts in university research budgets, the impact of which will cause major damage to universities and to the economy of the Province. The cuts will have a downstream effect on the economy which will be detrimental to the long-term employment of the people of the Province. I am sure that, like me, other hon. Members representing Northern Ireland constituencies received representations from universities on that matter. The
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>59</span>
universities have pointed out that research is essential to wealth creation and to high-quality teaching in universities; that it helps to promote economic growth; that it helps the voluntary sector; that it helps to improve health and health care; that it helps professions and public bodies; that it helps to improve the environment, and that it helps and supports local companies, organisations and professions. On and on the list goes. Yet what do we find? We find that the research budget is to be cut. I ask the Minister and his colleagues to reconsider that decision because we need assistance to tackle the funding cuts in university research budgets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The impact of the ACE cuts was mentioned; that will affect my area and constituency. A project was started in 1976 in my area of Magherafelt. It grew steadily over the years and gave the long-term unemployed the opportunity to secure employment, which gave enormous benefits to the entire community—the elderly, the lonely, pre-school children and so on. What will be the impact of the cuts in the ACE scheme? Who or what will provide opportunities to the long-term unemployed in areas like Magherafelt or Cookstown which have high unemployment? ACE provided a central focus for the community. Will that disappear?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What agency will be equipped with the necessary calibre of workers to provide essential services for the vulnerable—such as home visits in which a familiar face relieves a full-time carer—meals on wheels for the housebound disabled or ill and services that help the under-fives? Has not ACE been responsible for better working relationships in many specific areas in the Province? The question many people want answered is whether we can expect similar cuts in the scheme in 1997–98. The scheme should not be cut; it should be given Government support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents need houses, but the housing budget has been cut. Almost no public housing is being built; the waiting lists are longer and there is tremendous pressure on young people at the start of their married life, which has an impact on them now and in later years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gross expenditure for 1997–98 is down to £608 million, which means that new home starts by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive will have to be significantly reduced. Where will young people live? As a former member of the board of the executive, I have noticed that, over the years, rents have been increased to encourage young people to buy their own houses rather than go into public housing. That is forcing the issue. Fortunately for some, their rents will be paid for because they are on benefit, but the folks for whom I am deeply concerned are those caught in the poverty trap, who are left to pay everything. The money they receive for their hard day's work is not a high return for their labour. There is deep anxiety in the community about that issue.

The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) mentioned health matters. I concur with him about many of the problems that he raised, such as the backlog of cardiac surgery. My constituents face many problems because they have to wait longer for surgery. The impact of the budget proposals, right up to the millennium, does not help. The health scene seems to be darkening as the clouds gather year by year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We can talk about the fall in unemployment, but I remind the Committee that, although some have come off the unemployed lists, they may go on to another benefit and therefore be included in some other budget. It would be interesting to discover how many are merely on another benefit, rather than in full-time employment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My constituents, like those of other hon. Members, are deeply concerned about the impact of the cuts and we ask the Government, whichever party they are, to consider the matter carefully and to provide the necessary money to meet people's needs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I agree with that thesis, but that is only part of the fiscal scene. The implication that borrowing is the only way to raise extra money is incorrect. We must consider the revenue aspect and the increase in efficiency and recourse to a contingency fund in an emergency. I hope that the Minister and the Chancellor will be prepared to consider that point because it might be relevant to Northern Ireland.

National finances are in a dreadful state. Pensioners are being asked to supply a stamp when they reply to the pensions branch in Belfast. I understand that that idea is a dry run to see how many objections are received. In the past, whenever pensioners received a letter or statement from the pensions branch, they were supplied with a pre-paid envelope if they were required to reply. That is no longer the case. For a six-week dry run, pensioners will received an addressed envelope and they will be asked to affix a stamp. Something is wrong if we have reached the state where we have to ask pensioners to supply a stamp. It shows the present Administration's lack of efficiency and foresight in handling the costs of postage in Northern Ireland. However, we should be told why the scheme operates in Northern Ireland only rather than the whole of the kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

A counterbalancing saving will be made in Northern Ireland. We will not have to buy portraits of Her Majesty for various Government establishments. I asked about the decision, and was referred to Mr. Alan Shannon, who is chief executive of the prison service in Northern Ireland. He confirmed that the Government have removed a portrait of the Queen from his office to facilitate a neutral working environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure what that neutral working environment is for. Various people visit a prison governor's office. Is a neutral working environment meant for those who have dodged a fine by preferring to serve seven days in prison? Is it for burglars and petty thieves or is it for major offenders such as Mr. Stone, whom I saw admiring the tombstones in a graveyard in Belfast in a photograph in my newspaper yesterday, or Mr. Billy Wright? I would have thought that the last two are more likely to be offended by the fact that the Queen's portrait had been taken down.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the decision to take down the Queen's portrait was made to protect the sensitivities of those thugs and murderers from the other side of the political divide in Northern Ireland—the IRA, which has slaughtered people right across the Province and which is the well from which all the evil springs. I am not clear why the decision was made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, when my anger cooled a bit, I noted that the governor's office is frequently used for meetings involving staff and representatives from all sections of the community. Who are those representatives of the community? Was the decision taken to protect the gentle sensitivities of members of Sinn Fein/IRA who visit the office regularly or members of the Dail who visit prisoners in Northern Ireland and Great Britain? Members of the Dail also visit people held on remand. Does that mean that Her Majesty's portrait will be removed from prisons such as Holloway or Long Lartin?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sensitivities do not stop at Aldergrove airport; they extend over here. Her Majesty's Government must consider the decision in a wider context. If the measure applies to one of Her Majesty's establishments in Northern Ireland, surely it should be extended right across the board. Perhaps, members of the governor's staff may be very sensitive and they may not like Her Majesty's portrait on the wall. Could it be that some of the prison officers whose colleagues were butchered by the IRA and other paramilitaries object to Her
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>62</span>
Majesty's portrait, or are they, like me and every other decent person, insulted by the fact that it is being removed, and by the action that the Minister proposes? This is the greatest damned nonsense and insult that the people of Northern Ireland are ever likely to witness. Mr. Shannon should reconsider his position; his resignation would be greatly welcomed by decent folk. A speedy fundamental review and reversal of wider Civil Service policy should be set in motion forthwith.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I took note of the Minister's remarks when the first speech was made on this issue. He mentioned punishment beatings and told me that each such incident cost approximately £9,000. There were 302 of them last year, which amounted to a total cost of £2.7 million. The Minister did not, however, allude to punishment shootings, of which there were also a considerable number. Savings could be made there if some people could be persuaded to leave their bats and nails at home and let people get on with their lives as they wish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was much interesting talk earlier about cuts in expenditure on ACE and education. But instead of examining Northern Ireland expenditure that is not part of the appropriation orders, about which we had an interesting debate last week, should we not consider the changes that revolve around ceasefire costs and savings? Is it not that element—the Northern Ireland Office's expenditure on law and order and protective services—at which we should look to find answers to our questions today? Specifically we should inform ourselves about how the savings resulting from the IRA's cessation of murder were redistributed, and the time scale of redistribution.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot imagine how the Government thought that the IRA's temporary cessation of murder was permanent. However, they entered into commitments over some years with the perceived, but illusory, savings on anti-terrorist expenditure. That being so, I still have many problems with the sums, which seem not to add up. The figures are exceedingly complex and constantly changing in a myriad of details across Government expenditure in the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In 1994–95 to 1995–96, the budget on law, order and protected services fell by £51 million at 1995–96 prices. In 1996–97, the planned fall at 1995–96 prices was £56 million. But the estimated outturn now shows a fall of only £14 million; for 1997–98, the total
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0624">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>63</span>
estimate is £893 million at 1995–96 prices—a rise, on the same basis, of £14 million. For General Officer Commanding expenditure there was a fall of £48 million in 1995–96 and the sums are estimated to rise by £7 million for 1996–97, so they are still below the 1994– 95 figure by £41 million. I do not know what happens to the GOC's expenditure—whether it goes back to the Exchequer or is available to the Secretary of State. Perhaps the Committee can be told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where, then, are the shortfall and savings being spent? In his statement of December 1994, the Secretary of State said that the ceasefire meant the release of £180 million over three years; that would be £60 million a year. The following year, in December 1995, he said that another £106 million could be transferred from the law and order and protective services funding—again over three years. That is rolling expenditure and one must assume that it is being spent on capital projects, perhaps, or on something that rolls on from year to year. It is already committed and cannot be clawed back. That means that in the first year, 1995– 96, there were £60 million of savings, and that for 1996– 97, we can envisage a total of £95 million extra to spend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In December 1996, the Secretary of State clawed back £77 million from the police and £42 million from the Compensation Agency. That was £119 million in total. I understand that that, also, was to take place over three years, thus amounting to £40 million per annum. However, there were cuts in plans for ACE of £11 million 1997–98, with the same applying in the following two years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education has been hit. Its capital spending has been reduced from £111 million to £77 million. I remember that when we received funding from Limavady grammar school last year there was a wonderful fanfare, and then we were told that the major part of the expenditure would not be available until the following financial year—that is, the year that we were approaching. I assume that that approach will also apply to what is announced this year. We are told that expenditure on the Rathgael upgrading or rebuilding does not come from the education budget. Where does it come from? We have had housing chopped back to £22 million. Expenditure on roads has been cut by far more than is at first apparent. The planned expenditure in 1994–95 was cut. Then it was £22 million and in 1995– 96, it was £16.75 million. In 1996–97, it was £14.3 million. That is a drop of £8 million in three years, projected before the ending of the IRA ceasefire, with further cuts to take place in 1997–98. With the remaining programme, we have about £13 million-worth of projects under construction. Future items include the Strangford ferry replacement in 1997–98, the motorway phone replacement, at £5.5 million in 1998–99 and, in 1999–2000, the west link and Stockman's lane junction at
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>64</span>
£27.2 million. All the rest has been shelved for up to 15 years. The hon. Member for Mid-Ulster listed some of the projects concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All of the considerable sums that I have mentioned are not to be found by the Government; they are part of the private finance initiative. What the Government will pay for the road concerned will, I understand, be up to 20 per cent. of the total cost in a year. If it is less than that, no doubt we will be told. It is clear that much less money than the projected sums will be spent. We are told by nearly everyone in sight—although I except the Minister from this comment—that it is all the fault of Drumcree. But that begs the question why all the violence last summer took place. The Secretary of State, who by now has no doubt viewed last week's prime time programme of Telefis Eireann, knows that it was the consequence of a carefully planned programme by the IRA.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngaive (Mr. Worthington) at a previous sitting of the Committee quoted the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i>, which he said
	<br><blockquote><p>"talked about a week of madness and a lifetime of regrets."</p></blockquote>
He commented:
	<br><blockquote><p>"That is what we are now suffering in terms of the Northern Ireland budget. We can only say to all those people who are in a position to influence the events of the coming year that they should realise that the attempt intolerantly to impose one's view and to cause disruption and violence carries a heavy price, particularly for the vulnerable who are dependent on state services."—[	<i>Official Report, Northern Ireland Grand Committee</i>, 18 February 1997; c. 3.]</p></blockquote>
The misconception that underlies those words is the hon. Gentleman's belief that IRA-Sinn Fein are committed not only to peace but to a pluralist and peaceful Northern Ireland. I should have thought that that view had been blown out of the water; there is no evidence for it. All the evidence points in the other direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is plain that the IRA is intent on its terms, which echo back to the decision by Mr. Shannon that Her Majesty's portrait should be removed. It is the Queen's Government whom the IRA wants removed from Northern Ireland, and pleas to those people to help Northern Ireland out of the morass into which their actions have thrust it, are simply seen by them as confirmation of the success of their policy of violence. The IRA will therefore carry on with its destruction: it has embarked upon a programme to control the streets, to wrest control away from the Government and to cause confrontation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also unfortunately plain that, if neither the Government nor the police pick up the gauntlet that has been thrown down, the ordinary citizen, who understands clearly what is going on, will. That way lies more violence—and God knows what other horrors. These are matters for Government control, not for the diktats of the IRA. If that is recognised, we can start to move forward. It must also be recognised that paying the danegeld never brought peace and never will.

There is much more that I could add, Sir James, but time is short. There is concern about university research funding, which is fundamental because it is one of the strong points that we have in trying to sell the north coast area—the Coleraine triangle—as a site for inward investment. Cuts of 16 per cent. to the funding of the university there will not help: They will make matters much more difficult. We need to be much more careful. We should wait until the review of research facilities and research funding for universities is complete.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Western education and library board is to receive an increase of £275,000—a reduction of 2 per cent. in real terms which just cannot be achieved without the most drastic cuts in services. I accept that there is much chopping and changing, in many nooks and crannies. In all truth, the Government seem to have been engaged in a policy of misdirecting people's attention from the real problem, which is the fact that money that was taken out of the security budget has been committed elsewhere, which means that there is no easy way of ordering matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire said that the Labour Government will move the funding. It is easy to move the funding in one direction. It is not so easy to claw it back. If the Government have to claw money back into security, that cannot be done immediately, as it is already committed elsewhere. It is at that point that the funding from the contingency fund should be sought to tide us over the next two or three years until expenditure on security, as opposed to the rest of Northern Ireland expenditure, comes back into balance. Will the Minister please look at that?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.23 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As I am bearing in mind your remarks, Sir James, my speech may be a little disjointed and may not flow as smoothly as I should like it to.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should first like to comment on the test run that my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) revealed to the Committee. As someone who is interested in these matters and is spokesman on social security for my party I am greatly offended that the agency did not have the decency to let hon. Members know that the test run would be taking place in Northern Ireland. If we are told in advance we can reply to our constituents. When I have sat on other Committees colleagues have been told about test runs taking place in their constituencies. I was told about them too. I am greatly disappointed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad that the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster remembered that Toome bypass, which is in my constituency. He also remembered Crumlin high school. I do not need now to remember to mention them and I am pleased that he did so on my behalf. I should like to draw attention to the road safety officers in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>66</span>
The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), who is responsible for environmental matters in Northern Ireland, assured me during a Committee on draft road traffic regulations that he had schoolchildren's road safety at heart. He had called for a report from the British Institute of Traffic Education Research, but when the report recommended more road safety officers, he promptly decided to reduce their number from 13 to 11. Northern Ireland probably has the worst record in the United Kingdom for road accidents. To reduce the number of road traffic officers is disgraceful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The given reasons are public expenditure constraints and pressures on departmental running costs. How can anyone who has thought about giving the children of Northern Ireland traffic education decide to reduce something that would benefit those children? There were 16 traffic officers in 1991; now there are 13 and that will be reduced to 11 next year. That is a false economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Road transport firms in Northern Ireland have a difficulty in that licences have to be renewed every year for every vehicle whereas, in the rest of the United Kingdom, a licence, once applied for, needs to be changed only when a extra lorry is brought on to the roads or one is taken off. I cannot understand why the Department insists on that. A road freight firm that neglects to get a road traffic licence, perhaps by forgetting for a couple of days, may have a driver stopped. The driver and the firm could be brought to court and fined. In the rest of the United Kingdom, that would not happen. The Minister may not have time to respond to that, but I have already made inquiries on the point to the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss), and I am surprised that the problem was not sorted out long ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I need not go into all the roads that are not going to be built, but I want to mention one other point. There are ferry services between Larne and Cairnryan and between Belfast and Stranraer. Many times one reads in the newspapers of three-day or four-day offers. But the standard prices of the ferries are high. The difference in the charges for the short stretch of water between Northern Ireland and Scotland compared with what is charged at Dover, where there is competition with the channel tunnel, is amazing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The two firms concerned—P and O and Stena—are co-operating in Northern Ireland, but the only cooperation that I can see is in keeping up the prices of the standard fares. Will the Minister take a serious look at what could be a cartel involving two firms keeping prices up? We want to know why prices across the English channel are different from those that apply for the North channel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was interested to receive a glossy paper entitled "Moving Forward on Public Transport" about public transport in Northern Ireland, but the booklet is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>67</span>
practically all about Europe and the rest of the world. There is one page on railways, which, unfortunately, is a complete joke. We have 211 miles of railway line in Northern Ireland. We cannot even complete the line between Antrim and Belfast through Bleachgreen and Whiteabbey. We are told in the booklet that the system keeps together bus and rail, but we really only have buses and very little rail. No consideration whatever is given to light railways and practically every page relates to buses. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the gentleman in charge of the whole operation—I do not mean this as a slight—has a bus background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The way to get vehicles and freight off the roads is to have more railways. There is only one little passage in the booklet which says that Translink will co-operate with the ports in trying to move freight from the roads on to the railway, but we do not really have any railway lines that can take freight to the ports. It is a nice glossy booklet but its content is greatly lacking. I hope that, some day, there will be a co-ordinated transport strategy for Northern Ireland, which will include the airports. We do not even have a link between Belfast International airport and Belfast City airport, even though that could be achieved quite simply with a light railway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not detain the Committee much longer but I should like to congratulate DSS staff in Northern Ireland, who do a tremendous job. Their job is very difficult; they are expected to implement our decisions and, if we make a mistake, they carry the can. However, I am concerned that we still do not have a proper system in Northern Ireland to combat fraud. I have been promised that all sorts of things are happening behind the scenes but we still have giro drops. We still have to bother with people who travel from one side of the border to the other and claim benefit on both sides. We know that people on building sites are doing the double. I work in the construction industry and know that that happens. I take full account of the fact that it is dangerous to go on to certain building sites and demand someone's identification to find out whether he is on benefit, but we have to face that situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am a plumber by trade and I know the construction industry. Years ago, when apprentices were brought into the building trade, they served seven years. That period was reduced and it was decided that apprentices should go to technical college. The apprentices went to the technical college in the evenings, but they still served six years. It was then decided that six years was too long and that there should be more technical college work, perhaps one day a week, and a reduction in the total time to five years. To the best of my knowledge, the time has now fallen to three years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that plumbers, bricklayers and the other boys get jobs and I am not criticising, but it is wrong
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>68</span>
for the length of time in apprenticeships to be reduced and the college training for those apprentices to be removed. Perhaps the Minister will consider that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Sir John Wheeler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is the second meeting of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee: the debate on the appropriation order intervened. You will agree, Sir James, that the six hon. Members who spoke this morning treated us to an intellectual feast of philosophy and consideration of the economic and other interests of Northern Ireland. I for one am deeply grateful to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recurring theme of the speeches by the size hon. Members has been financial resources—their deployment, their inadequacy and the lack of funding or the cuts. In my opening comments on 18 February at our first sitting, I said that the Government intended to aim for public expenditure of 40 per cent. of gross domestic product or below in 1997–98. The Committee will appreciate that if that is Government policy, as it is—it is apparently agreed and supported by Her Majesty's Opposition—all that follows in terms of public spending must flow from that very clear and positive commitment. So it is left to us to discuss, as hon. Members did this morning, how to order the pot of money—some £8 billion—that is allocated for expenditure in Northern Ireland and where to prioritise, what to cut, what to increase and what can be gained from efficiency. What cannot be obtained is extra funding from United Kingdom taxpayers because the Government are committed to not increasing income tax. Her Majesty's loyal Opposition are similarly committed and intend to work within the same budget.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it is important not to mislead the public on such issues? I draw his attention to the education budget and the capital programme budget, which has been cut to £26 million this year. The Minister with responsibility for education said that there would be £50 million of private finance initiative to replace the normal source of funding. Does the Minister agree that it is totally dishonest to say that there will be £50 million of private finance initiative money coming forward in the coming year? If that is not misleading the House and the people of Northern Ireland, will the Minister explain the projects, when they will start and how much they will cost?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am truly saddened. I had anticipated that the hon. Gentleman was going to tell the Committee that he had got the Labour party's

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>69</span>
promise about income tax wrong and that there would be increases in direct taxation. But no—he diverted me on to an important point of detail to which, if time allows, I shall come.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the substantive point, it is true that statements made should be honest, accurate and truthful. As far as I am aware, I have never made any statement about financial matters that is not accurate and neither have my colleagues who have responsibility for ministerial duty in Northern Ireland. As to the detail of what the hon. Gentleman says, that is a matter that we may yet come to during my remarks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the concept of truth and the whole truth; I would not want anybody to be left in any doubt. The Minister spoke about not being committed to raising income tax and about the Opposition not being ready to raise income tax. Does not the Minister accept that public finance is raised by means other than income tax? Money can be raised either by the present Government or by any other Government.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Belfast, South. If anybody should be an authority on the truth, it is the hon. Gentleman. I take his strictures very much to heart. He is absolutely right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government get their money from taxation, direct or indirect. They get their money from what they borrow—on which they have to pay interest and on which inflation and interest rates partly depend. They can get money into the public sector through the private finance initiative, which is still in its early days although it is developing in a promising way in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The hon. Gentleman is quite right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, that does not alter the fundamental point of the discussion that we have had, which has formed a substantive part of the remarks of the six hon. Members who have spoken in the Committee this morning: if there are cuts in one area, the funding goes to another. If one dislikes the cut, one must say what the alternative arrangement should be. What I have not heard echoing through the Committee in great detail, either on 18 February or today, is where the Northern Ireland Members in particular would be willing to give up funding and expenditure in order that it should be diverted to some other part of Northern Ireland's budgetary expenditure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all aware of the fact that there is freedom to debate a very narrow slice of the round in any one year. Most of the funding is committed for years ahead. It cannot be changed and has to remain at its existing and slowly increasing levels, as a result of inflation alone. Would not the Minister agree that the resumption of IRA violence created an emergency situation, which is shown by the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>70</span>
Government's decision to transfer funding over a period of years? Therefore, he has a good reason for going to the contingency fund to tide us over.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall come to that point. On 18 February and during today's debate, much reference has been made to the law and order budgets. It is true that in 1994–95, the Government were able to reallocate £286 million from the law and order budget, from the costs of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and from the Compensation Agency. That money could be deployed on top of the budgeted expenditure—health, education, roads and any other aspect of expenditure that we have discussed—as a dividend, which some have called the peace dividend.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the 1996 survey, however, almost £120 million of that money had to be restored to the law and order budget for RUC overtime and the Compensation Agency because, in February 1996—as every member of the Committee knows—the Provisional IRA ceasefire ended with the Docklands bomb, which cost the lives of two members of the public and injured 100. Since the autumn of last year, every 30 hours in Northern Ireland there has been a major attempt to kill someone—either a member of the RUC or of the armed forces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The consequence of that decision by Provisional IRA/Sinn Fein is that the money that was available for public services in Northern Ireland must—quite properly—be redeployed to the protection of life. Everyone in the Committee deplores that situation. On top of that came last summer's events, which have also been subject to discussion in this morning's proceedings. The hon. Member for East Londonderry has pointed out—as has the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster with his customary statesmanlike remarks—that the Provisional IRA/Sinn Fein, with its manipulation of residents' associations and determination to cause as much trouble as possible, was the chief cause of those events. There is a real prospect that the same will occur this summer because of the same people's actions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the elections come—the general election and the local government elections on 21 May in Northern Ireland—I hope very much that the people of Northern Ireland will ask Adams, McGuinness and other members of the Provisional IRA/Sinn Fein mafia—the thugs who have caused the unrest—not only why they are killing and beating people up in their hundreds; why they are intimidating people; and why they are racketeering and causing such misery to the community of Northern Ireland; but why they are taking away from Northern Ireland money that could be otherwise deployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry rightly drew attention to the 302 recorded so-called punishment attacks, which cost at least £9,000 each in terms of treatment and compensation—nearly £3 million in total. Those are wicked and cruel acts of

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>71</span>
terrorism, designed to intimidate and hold in thrall the nationalist population. In so doing, Northern Ireland's health service and education service—and, indeed, the roundabout described by the hon. Member for MidUlster—are deprived of resources that should be deployed to benefit the people of Northern Ireland as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Among members of the Committee—and in the coming elections in Northern Ireland—there should be no doubt about who is responsible for the misuse of taxpayer's money and the criminal acts that flow from that misuse.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept the Minister's arguments about where responsibility lies for the misuse of funds that could be used for other purposes. Does he mean, however, that if the IRA were to enter into a genuine and permanent ceasefire and end punishment beatings, the money that has been put aside for law and order can be moved to the purposes that he mentioned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman drew attention to those points in a perspective speech. Yes, there should be renewal of the ceasefire—not the bogus ceasefire that we had from 1994 but a genuine standing down of the terrorist structure and an end to the stocks of Semtex and weapons, an end to bomb making and an end to intimidation and punishment attacks. All of that should end. Then, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, Her Majesty's Government would be able to use the money in the Northern Ireland block for others services expected there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry asked why we could not use the contingency reserve. The difficulty is that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer expects Northern Ireland to live within its costed block. He expects that Northern Ireland will use its money in the same way as any other part of the United Kingdom for the provision of education. No system of modern government can depend on territorial Ministers arriving at the Treasury door and saying, "Give us the money as we have a problem we cannot solve." We are expected to survive within our block expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Antrim talked about road tax and expenditure, suggesting that road taxes, like most others, are not hypothecated. He is absolutely right on that. The road tax was abolished by the postwar Labour Government in 1949, since when vehicle excise duty—no longer a road tax—has been a contribution to Treasury coffers for use within the whole of the United Kingdom. There is no question of using a road tax in Northern Ireland for roads there, because the road tax no longer exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South raised rates and the transitional relief scheme—the £10,000 limit—that I brought in to assist smaller businesses. Relief on
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>72</span>
rates must be looked at in the round; all ratepayers in Northern Ireland enjoy significantly higher rate support than in Great Britain. I am not sure whether I should tempt my hon. Friends to intervene at this point; perhaps they object to that generosity of treatment. I see that my hon. Friend the Comptroller of Her Majesty's Household is becoming excited by that idea so I shall pass on as quickly as I can for fear of bringing on an intervention. The transitional relief scheme is on top of the relief that Northern Ireland already enjoys and cannot be treated differently.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have a problem. If I were to promise the Committee, as I shall not, that I would increase the scheme from £10,000 to £12,000 or £15,000—and I can see expectations of joy spreading already on the faces of Northern Ireland Members—I would still find some hon. Members coming to me to say, "If only you had made it £15,500, my constituent, Mr. O'Malley, would be able to enjoy a better quality of life." Unfortunately, the figures are, by nature, arbitrary. The business of Government is to fix the best and most appropriate figure having regard to all the circumstances and what is affordable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry raised a point about military expenditure—General Officer Commanding expenditure—of benefit to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland benefits—if that is the right way to describe it—from Ministry of Defence expenditure, which is separate from the £8 billion block. Were there ever changes in the dispositions of the armed forces in Northern Ireland, we can be sure that the MOD would take its funding away with its soldiers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Several points were raised in the debate, and I shall try to catch up with a few more of them if time allows. There was much discussion about the ACE scheme. Committee members are understandably concerned about cuts in that scheme. I know how constituency pressures arise when schemes like ACE are modified. Constituents will have become accustomed to income from the scheme, and they expect it to continue in perpetuity—like the Government! However, I urge on the Committee the necessity of remembering that the scheme was devised in the early 1980s to meet a totally different set of unemployment characteristics. Unemployment in Northern Ireland has fallen in the past year by more than 8,000, which is partly due to the extraordinary determination of Barnoness Denton of Wakefield, who travelled the world on behalf of Northern Ireland in pursuit of jobs for its people. I warmly thank the hon. Member for Mid-Ulster for his gracious remarks about Baroness Denton's efforts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If unemployment is coming down, the scheme's purpose must change. The ACE programme will not be abolished—there are still around 5,000 places in it. However, it must change to meet the changing unemployment—perhaps I should say the changing employment—characteristics in Northern Ireland. A
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1996-1997V005P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>73</span>
discussion paper about the best ways to tackle long-term unemployment has just been published—I hear eager cries from Opposition Members—about which, I hope, we shall have a constructive debate. I am sure that hon. Members from Northern Ireland will participate in it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had two wide-ranging debates in this and our previous sitting. The problem is that there has been a huge number of issues to consider and that the Minister has had little time to reply to all the questions that were raised. When the Committee resumes in the next Parliament, it might be wiser if it chooses a Northern Ireland Department on which to base its debate so that the responsible Minister can address
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>74</span>
questions in detail. that would avoid having a broad, wide-ranging debate, which does not allow for proper discussion or analysis of some of the complex issues.
