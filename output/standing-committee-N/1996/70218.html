	<div class='legislation'>Public Expenditure Plans for Northern Ireland for 1997–98/1999–2000</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Sir John Wheeler)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of the public expenditure plans for Northern Ireland for 1997–98/1999–2000.</p></blockquote>
The Secretary of State announced his public expenditure survey allocations on 10 December. The allocations reflected the outcome of ministerial considerations of all the pressures facing the Northern Ireland block. The overall total for the block was set in the national survey, which once again confirmed the Government's commitment to maintaining tight but realistic targets for public spending. At the national level, spending as a percentage of gross domestic product is set to meet the Government's target of 40 per cent. or below in 1997–98. Northern Ireland shares in the benefits of prudent fiscal policy and must also play its part in the control of public spending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland economy has been performing well in recent years. Northern Ireland's GDP per head in 1995 relative to the United Kingdom average was at its highest for two decades. Over the past five years manufacturing output has grown at more than double the rate for the United Kingdom as a whole. Unemployment continues to fall and is now at its lowest for 16 years. Record employment has been achieved. The Province's economy is therefore in good shape and I am confident that, if we had peace and stability, it would continue to improve strongly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In spite of the economic improvements, the Government continue to recognise fully Northern Ireland's particular needs and circumstances. Total public spending per head continues to be substantially higher than for the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the allocations to programmes made in December, I reiterate the Secretary of State's comment of the time that we were faced with difficult decisions. The law and order budget, which had been a source of what was called the peace dividend in the previous two surveys, once again required substantial additional resources following the Provisional IRA's abandonment of its ceasefire, the terrible disturbances of the summer and the general increase in terrorist activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even during the PIRA ceasefire, there were continuing terrorist punishment attacks. In the light of those inescapable pressures, the Secretary of State had no alternative but to restore law and order as the top spending priority. Almost £120 million had to be provided to the police and for compensation over the
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
survey period. Those resources could, of course, have been used elsewhere by our economic and social programmes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government also attach great importance to economic growth in the Province and additional resources were given to the Industrial Development Board to help to fund projects promising new jobs. Self-sustaining jobs are vital to Northern Ireland's future prosperity and are also an effective means of targeting social need. It would have been short-sighted not to have taken advantage of the solid inward investment opportunities on offer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service is also an important spending priority. We already spend £1.6 billion a year on health and personal social services, but the Government recognise the pressures that the health service is facing. Additional resources were therefore provided to health in the 1996 survey, allowing for real growth, as has also been the case in previous years. The importance of the new Causeway hospital was also recognised and the Secretary of State decided that that project, costing £47 million in total, should proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The education of Northern Ireland's children and young people is also important to the Province's future prosperity. While protecting education where at all possible, the Secretary of State decided that the classroom should receive priority in the 1996 survey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key priorities of the police, compensation, industrial development, health and schools had to be accommodated from within the control total set for Northern Ireland. Ministers were faced with difficult choices on which programmes should be reduced to release the necessary resources, and housing, training and employment schemes and urban regeneration were identified as the main sources of reductions. Those programmes have received substantial allocations of resources in the past and much has been achieved as a result. Even after the cuts that have to be made they will continue to receive substantial resources, which will be targeted as appropriate on the most needy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that my introductory remarks provide a helpful context to last year's public expenditure decisions. The survey was tight for everyone, not least because of the constraints imposed on us by security and compensation considerations. We had to cover key pressures and in doing so release resources from elsewhere. I have identified the main programmes which were affected and I would of course be happy to hear of other programmes which might have been targeted instead. I look forward to what I know will be an encouraging, interesting and positive debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony Worthington 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Clydebank and Milngavie)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the Minister says, the debate about the budget and expenditure plans for Northern Ireland has been dominated by the fact that since the breakdown of the ceasefire by the IRA and the events of the summer, which have given a great deal of fame to Drumcree, the Government have had to redirect back to security services the resources that were previously spent on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0592">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
education, health and other social services. The peace dividend has been put back on hold and Northern Ireland is suffering.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The whole matter was summed up by the headline of a leader article in the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> in the summer, which talked about a week of madness and a lifetime of regrets. That is what we are now suffering in terms of the Northern Ireland budget. We can only say to all those people who are in a position to influence the events of the coming year that they should realise that the attempt intolerantly to impose one's view and to cause disruption and violence carries a heavy price, particularly for the vulnerable who are dependent on state services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point, but could he give us some guidance? Over the years we have been told at the appropriation debate that we could not discuss expenditure on law and order. How is it, then, that we are suddenly told that block grant is affected by law and order? Does the hon. Gentleman also accept that the decisions that were imposed on those in authority in the police service as a result of consultation with Maryfield may be the real cause of the anarchy that developed?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope to be able to answer the hon. Gentleman's questions in a few weeks, although they would be best directed to the Minister. If Ministers have said over the years that it is not possible to discuss the law and order budget, it is for them, not me, to explain their position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge that it is not Ministers who determine the character of the appropriation order debate, but the House. The procedures of the House would have to change for the appropriation debate to be extended to include discussion of the financial considerations of policing and security.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I might provide a little clarification. The Northern Ireland Office Vote is provided for in the public expenditure White Paper. The Northern Ireland Office allocation is at the top of the first page and is followed by the Northern Ireland Office Departments. That would appear to put the matter in order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member --> 	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie not understand that people in Northern Ireland will find it hard to agree with his remarks? We have had 25 years of the most vicious and evil deeds by the IRA, but it has never been mentioned in debates in the Committee in regard to making cuts. Suddenly, there was an incident that had nothing to do with Drumcree church, but with the Garvaghy road—I wish that we would get our geography right, because that is where the trouble took place. Will the hon. Gentleman ask the people of Dunloy to desist from going into the street armed with
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
hurley sticks to keep people from visiting their place of worship? Will he call on them to desist from breaking windows in the church where others want to worship or from breaking up the tombstones in the churchyard? Surely, the hon. Gentleman must consider such matters when he takes the line that he does.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Members to whom I have deferred will seek to attract your attention later, Sir James. I am simply making the abundantly clear point that one can uphold the law at a low cost, on the same basis as in the rest of the United Kingdom, or one can uphold it at great expense. I did not point the finger at anybody; I simply asked those who are in a position to influence the events of the summer to make a direct connection between the expense that was involved in upholding the law and the services that would be available to the people of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the concept that he has just advanced, is the hon. Gentleman aware that the Government, aided by the Opposition, are creating a powder keg by engaging in a bipartisan policy that is rejected by an overwhelming number of people in Northern Ireland and by appeasing terrorism to such an extent that they inflame the majority, which is rightly worried about its future constitutional position? In those circumstances, what the hon. Gentleman dismisses as the rejection of law becomes the match that ignites the whole situation. Will he please refrain from suggesting that Drumcree is the source of all our troubles?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not suggest any of the things that have been attributed to me. One of the problems in debates such as this is that people use comments for their own purposes and divert attention from what was said. I am saying that it is abundantly clear, for any Government at any time, that if inordinate resources are devoted to law and order in Northern Ireland because of the activities of members of either tradition or any party, then education, social services and health provision will suffer. Any Government must take that into account. The regrettable fact is that there have been cuts in other services because of the deteriorating security position.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, those problems should not deflect attention from the way in which the Government have wasted money. Although the matter was debated yesterday in the House, some time must be devoted to the question of the cost of BSE to the Northern Ireland economy. As the shadow spokesman for agriculture, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang), made clear yesterday, nowhere in the United Kingdom has suffered more for less cause than Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the United Kingdom, more than 165,000 cattle have contracted BSE. In the rest of Europe many of the handful of cows that contracted the disease came from Britain. Other countries have preserved a healthy regime and have protected their cattle from BSE. There have been very few incidents of BSE in Northern Ireland, but the industry has suffered inordinately
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0593">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
because of its importance and its dependence on export. The Government have reported that, before March 1996, beef exports from Northern Ireland had a gross value of more than £200 million a year. Can the Minister give the specific cost of the BSE crisis in Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In opening the dabate, the Minister talked about the Government's choice of cuts. Throughout the United Kingdom, the Government have chosen to attack those services that elsewhere would be provided by local government—and they have done that at great cost to all involved. I shall describe some of the actions that the Government have taken and then ask the Minister to justify them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, I shall deal with training. For the second successive year the Government have mounted an excessive attack on the action for community employment training scheme. Many people claim that the ACE scheme has been a considerable success, and people in other parts of the country look at it with some envy. They remember the old community programme scheme, on which ACE is based. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom where the community programme has been retained, albeit under a different name. People in Northern Ireland agree that it is a useful scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, any scheme has imperfections. The ACE scheme is acknowledged to have had great value, but do the Government have an aversion to it? Each year, in the search for cuts and economies, the Government have turned to the ACE scheme, but they have not offered an explanation. Last year, there was an attempted 25 per cent. cut; this year it is proposed that 2,000 places be cut. It seems clear that the ACE scheme has enemies in the Northern Ireland Office.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the most serious aspect of ACE funding cuts is that many of the core posts—the ones that make the scheme succeed, provide the training for unemployed people and ensure the delivery of services to the most vulnerable in our society—are at risk? The loss of those posts could threaten the success of the remaining schemes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that observation. Such a cut would endanger not only one or two posts, but would threaten a constellation of services based on those posts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that the Government explain that. All that we have each year is a line in a report saying "20 per cent. cut", or "25 per cent. cut" or "2,000 places cut".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is clear that the Government do not believe in their own scheme. They explain cuts in terms of the annual budget, but they do not come clean with the Committee and say that they are cutting the ACE scheme each year because they do not believe that it works, or because they believe that it is targeted towards the wrong people. People tell me that it is a good scheme for married women returners but that it is a bad one for helping back into full-time employment
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
mature men without skills. If that is so, let us have a debate, rather than be faced with an annual, unjustified cut.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the face of it, the ACE scheme should be commendable. It follows the Government's policy objective of targeting social need, in that it is used most often in the most deprived areas and steered towards disadvantaged groups such as the elderly, the disabled and the unemployed. It is claimed that 40 per cent. of participants have gone on to full employment, and that in some areas the scheme is a significant part of the local economy. I remember a visit I made to the Shankill area with the Training and Employment Agency. I was told that 800 jobs in that area were dependent on ACE. Cutting the scheme in areas that are short of employment is extremely significant and should not be dismissed by a single line in a budget statement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that cutting all ACE schemes by a fixed percentage does not distinguish between the successful schemes that have got people back to work and others? One scheme in Donaghadee, for example, has a record of getting 68 per cent. of participants back to work within three months of leaving the scheme, while other schemes have virtually no record—possibly 5 or 6 per cent.—of success, and yet all schemes are being cut by 50 per cent. across the board.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for his intervention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly we need a Government policy statement. We cannot go on without examining a significant aspect of that part of the Northern Ireland economy which is influenced by the Government. Issues of quality and targeting may be relevant, but killing by stealth each year is not the way to tackle the matter. It seems an odd choice of priorities for the Government, certainly in the light of the Labour party's priorities. There is no doubt in our mind as to our number one priority. It is the commitment to a windfall tax and to raising at least £3 billion to help unemployed 18 to 25-year-olds back into work, training or education and to give them a sense of purpose. When the Government say that they have cut training—deliberately—the major difference between the parties is exposed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a historical problem. In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar (Ms Mowlam), the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) said on 19 December 1995 that there were projected cuts in expenditure on the ACE programme for the three succeeding years of 23 per cent., 27 per cent. and 21 per cent. Why are the Government doing that? They are silent about the training issue in Northern Ireland, but 50 per cent. of Northern Ireland's jobless do not have skills and 30 per cent. of all companies report that they have difficulty in recruiting for specific jobs. The Northern Ireland small business survey found that small firms in Northern Ireland are finding it difficult to recruit skilled staff, and that skill shortages are the major barrier to expansion. Why are the Government attacking training?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0594">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
One of the saddest press releases of the year came from the chief executive of the Training and Employment Agency, and concerned the job skills programme for adults. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Adult provision has been more difficult but we have looked very carefully at the situation and have come up with an approach which will allow the maximum number of adults to be trained within our budget.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>It will mean some belt tightening elsewhere in the funding system and we will be asking employers for a contribution."</p></blockquote>
The punchline is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"But it means we can preserve approximately two thirds of the current 6400 adult places, which is better than we feared."</p></blockquote>
The chief executive of a training agency is rejoicing at being able to maintain two thirds of his programme! If I were in that position, I would be weeping at having lost one third of my programme. This is claimed to be high-quality, NVQ-based training in a wide range of skills, but it is being cut savagely by the Government. Why are they doing that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<i>Ulster Business says:</i>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The salient fact here is that two-thirds of the German manual workforce is skilled … In Northern Ireland, only a third of our manual workforce in manufacturing is skilled. We are working with a skills base about half the German level and trying to get by with far less expenditure on R&D. How do we square this circle? How on earth can we compete against that? The answer is with very low wages and a low exchange rate."</p></blockquote>
I have to ask whether the Government have their priorities right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Joe Hendron 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have two points about ACE schemes and training overall. On ACE jobs, the Government are aware of the report on a tale of one city, paid for by "Make Belfast Work", showing that my constitutency is by far the most deprived in these islands. I listened to what the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney) said about success stories. My own territory is terribly deprived, whatever social criteria are used, and yet there has still been a 50 per cent. cut in ACE schemes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, the firm of F.G. Wilson is well known in Lame and came into west Belfast. By any standard, it is a world-class organisation, and yet Mary Lyons, the chief executive of Springvale—the doyen of training centres in Northern Ireland—has complained bitterly to me that F.G.

I was about to ask the Minister particular questions about the further education budget, because the issues are linked. The Government intend to incorporate these colleges by August. The relevant legislation has not yet been introduced, but I have heard that the colleges are not ready for that incorporation—the planning has not been done. There are considerable fears that the budget allocation for these colleges at a time of maximum change is likely to be inadequate to sustain their current programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Day 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cheadle)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am a little confused about what the hon. Gentleman is trying to tell the Committee through his questions to the Minister. Is he suggesting that the extra security expenditure necessitated by the collapse of the peace process is wrong, or is he, as a spokesman for the Opposition, offering more money than the Government? I am confused about that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is confused. He must have missed my specific reference to the more than £3 billion that we intend to raise for education and training through the windfall tax. That seems an effective solution and I am glad to have the opportunity of proposing it again. I hope that the hon. Gentleman can follow me on the occasions when I make speeches and intervene at the appropriate moment so that I can reinforce the point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have asked about further education, and I want now to ask about pre-five education. We were told last year that the Government has earmarked £8 million for pre-five education, which was to be linked with the voucher scheme. We do not welcome that scheme and would not implement it, but we welcome the fact that extra attention would be given to the nursery sector. As the Government have now cancelled the introduction of a nursery voucher scheme for at least a year, what has happened to that £8 million? Has it simply been swept away into security services or has some element of it been retained to allow some expansion of nursery education?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister also tell us about the budgeting for the education and library boards? As the Minister knows, the Prime Minister had to back down on the proposal to reduce the number of boards from five to three. That does not mean that he is a listening Prime Minister; it means merely that occasionally he can do his sums. He realised that if he introduced that proposal, it would have been defeated in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram) claimed when the budget was announced that the proposal to reduce the education and library boards from five to three would result in a saving of £2 million. At that time, the Northern Ireland Office could not have known that the Prime Minister would back down on the proposal, so what sum was put in the budget for it—or is there a hole in the budget because that planned saving will not now be made? It will be interesting to hear the response to that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that a great deal of time and money was spent trying to plan that three boards system? Money must have been lost to education as a result of that proposal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a rhetorical question, to which the hon. Gentleman knows the answer. The preparation to reduce the boards from five to four and then from five to three was one of those interesting exercises that lasted not just a year, but throughout an entire Parliament, ending with the decision to keep all five.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that while the boards proved to the Northern Ireland Department of Education and the Minister that the proposal to reduce them was nonsense, the exercise was valuable in that the area boards are now proposing genuine savings which do not diminish the services that they are providing to schools.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. The education and library boards may well be proposing savings, but in some cases that is because they are in great financial difficulties. I am told that the Southern education and library board has projected a £5 million deficit. I was about to ask whether the Government are monitoring the consequences of their decisions for the education and library boards. I was concerned last year that the Government did not know how many teachers had been made redundant as a consequence of their actions. They said that they did not keep that information centrally and it could be collected only at inordinate expense. That seems odd. Northern Ireland has a population of 1.6 million and one would expect any United Kingdom authority to know how many teachers were being made redundant as a consequence of its actions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is that a case for abolishing the boards altogether and centralising the function?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might make it easier for the Government to know what they were doing, but it seems an inadequate reason for changing a system of administration. I would prefer it if the Government knew what they were doing rather than abolishing boards to find out what they are doing. The serious issue is the consequences for education in Northern Ireland of the Government's decisions. I do not know the full background, but I am sure that everybody was alarmed to hear that the Belfast board has put forward proposals to remove all its school crossing patrols. That is an extraordinary proposal and can only reflect the degree of pressure that the board feels it is under.
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
It was only by asking a question that I found out that the budget for books in Northern Ireland libraries has been halved this year. There is scope for considerable debate on those issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to ask the Minister three final questions. Can the Government tell us how they justify their housing budget? There has again been a cut this year, despite a 7 per cent. rise in homelessness. The Government have announced cuts of £23 million, which threaten the housing department budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, what has happened to the national health service budget? There seems to be a conflict between what the Minister said this morning and what has previously been said by the Minister, the Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and for Health and the Minister with responsibility for health in Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State for Health said that in 1997–98, the budget for the hospital and community health service will rise by £1.2 billion; that is a rise of 3 per cent. for the United Kingdom. However, in answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd), the Minister with responsibility for health in Northern Ireland admitted that Northern Ireland does not get a fair share of any additional resources made available to the national health service. There seems to be a conflict between what has been said by the Minister with responsibility for health in Northern Ireland and what has been said by other Ministers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, will the Minister report on any progress that is being made with the private finance initiative? As he will know, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has pinned considerable hopes on the PFI, but the progress in Northern Ireland has been risible. The PFI dates back almost five years. How many projects have been processed in Northern Ireland and in what areas?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently went to the Department of Education in Northern Ireland to hear what progress had been made in education. I am grateful to the civil servants for their courteous explanation. There is talk of pathfinder projects and mention in the Budget statement of there being 100 schemes in the frame for education, but my guess is that we are probably still a year away from an education PFI project, even if that project then looks as if it will stand up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is happening across the board with the PFI? Is the Minister responsible for driving the PFI? I should have thought that that was logical, because he is responsible for the Department of Finance and Personnel. What has happened about the PFI in Northern Ireland? What is the attitude of the Treasury to the lack of progress? I cannot believe that Northern Ireland has not been thoroughly spanked on the issue. Everybody is saying that the PFI is the solution to the problem of the underfunding of infrastructure and capital resources in Northern Ireland, so why has so little happened? In his budget statement, the Secretary of State said that the PFI was beginning to gather momentum in Northern Ireland. How could one tell?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I follow the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), who spoke at such length and with such superb condescension about the interests of people in Northern Ireland, whom he does not represent and whom his party refuses to recognise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are glad to have this debate. However, we must first note the time that it has taken to secure it. Today is 18 February. The Budget for the United Kingdom was announced on 26 November and contained the global figures for expenditure in Northern Ireland. Indeed, when the Budget statement was made, a bundle of press releases was issued by various Government Departments, including the Scottish and Welsh Offices which set out further detail of the block grant expenditure in Scotland and Wales—but there was no such release from the Northern Ireland Office. It was not until 10 December that it honoured us with a statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the Budget, there have been statements on the local government settlements for Wales and for Scotland and debates on expenditure there which were arranged by the Welsh and Scottish Offices. I regret to observe that the Northern Ireland Office, while it has facilitated this debate, did not arrange it. The debate would not have taken place had we not pressed for it. Why was provision for debate absent? Why has there been a delay? One fears that the Northern Ireland Office is scared of accountability. One also suspects that part of the reason for its reluctance to debate those matters is that, in reality, the settlement is harsh for Northern Ireland, in global terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his statement on 10 December, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Chancellor announced in the Budget the public expenditure totals for Northern Ireland of £8.2 billion next year rising to £8.4 billion in 1999–2000. This will mean that public expenditure in Northern Ireland will continue to be substantially higher than for the United Kingdom as a whole."</p></blockquote>
That last sentence was echoed by the Minister of State today, but it is seriously misleading on two counts. First, it conceals the fact that, unlike in the rest of the United Kingdom, expenditure in Northern Ireland is being cut. That is not the argument that was sparked off earlier about the allocations within the block grant or the false suggestions that were being made, particularly by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie, that, because of the difficulties last summer, there had to be huge cuts in expenditure elsewhere. We know that those statements are inaccruate—the figures are available and they refute those suggestions. My point is quite different: the global figure for Northern Ireland is being reduced, and the reductions have nothing to do with our particular difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall point out the extent of the reductions. The Northern Ireland Office press release of 10 December sums up the figures for the next two years as increases in cash terms of 0.4 per cent in each, but in real terms—this is what matters—that translates to reductions of
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
1.5 and 1.6 per cent. By way of contrast, the position for the United Kingdom as a whole is positive in cash and real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Red Book, which was published by the Chancellor in November, summarises the position at page 95. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The control total is planned to grow on average by 2.5 per cent. a year…in cash terms. On current projections of the GDP deflator, this represents real growth of 0.5 per cent. a year."</p></blockquote>
The real terms growth of United Kingdom public expenditure is modest, at a mere 0.5 per cent., but that is an awful lot better than reductions of 1.5 per cent. The key point about public expenditure in Northern Ireland is that, compared with the rest of the United Kingdom, we have fared very badly. The Northern Ireland Office has failed to protect the global public expenditure figures for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State's statement, as repeated today by the Minister of State, was misleading in a second way. He referred to public expenditure being higher per capita, but that is far too crude a comparison. Public expenditure should be set to deliver a certain level of service. In Northern Ireland, that requires higher expenditure because of greater need and the higher cost of service delivery as a result of geography, sparseness of population and other factors. Crude per capita comparisons are misleading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor of the Exchequer boasted, in his Budget statement, that, within the modest overall increases in Great Britain, he had secured increases for certain sectors, notably health and education. He referred to a £1.25 billion increase on national health service spending, a real terms increase of 3.5 per cent. The Secretary of State claimed a similar percentage increase for Northern Ireland, to £56 million, yet the table at the end of the Northern Ireland Office press release shows an increase of £39 million, or 2.4 per cent. in real terms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since then, and following pressure from my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth), a further £3.5 million has been made available for health. That shows that the original amount was inadequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On education, the Red Book shows that there were increases for schools in England of 4.4 per cent. In Northern Ireland, the Secretary of State claimed an increase of £30 million: by my reckoning, that is a rise of only about 2 per cent. in real terms, half the increase for England. Furthermore, the table at the end of the press release shows that in fact there has been a decrease of 2.3 per cent., or £32 million. I hope that the Minister of State can explain that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not go into detail on specific matters, Sir James, as I hope that my colleagues will have the opportunity to make their comments about them. However, I do want to speak about one matter which may appear peripheral but which is important—the operation of the Millennium Commission and the millennium projects in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Millennium projects receive 50 per cent. funding from the Millennium Commission, the rest of the funding being raised from elsewhere by their promoters. That system causes a problem in Northern
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Ireland. Because of the absence of real local government, and because of the structure of public expenditure, other sources of funding are not available. If Northern Ireland Office support is withdrawn from millennium projects, there is a serious danger that no such projects will be able to proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is a special worry to me and to the hon. Members for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) and for South Down (Mr. McGrady), who I am sure will allow me to represent their interests in the matter. The project that I have in mind involves the restoration of the canal between Newry and Loch Neagh. The project is backed by four local councils: Newry and Mourne, Banbridge, Armagh and Craigavon. It would cost £24 million, £12 million of which was to come, it was hoped, from the Millennium Commission and £6 million from the four councils and other bodies. We had also hoped for £6 million from the Northern Ireland Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The project's obvious attractions include the promotion of tourism and the regeneration of local villages such as Poyntzpass, Scarva and Gilford. In view of the time I shall not labour the point, but the project offered considerable advantages. However, the public expenditure statement in December withdrew all support for millennium projects. That was a poor decision, especially as such projects multiply public expenditure. The Northern Ireland Office money would have benefited from a significant multiplier effect. Also, unlike other projects that have been promoted in connection with European Commission and international funds and thought up merely to secure a grant, that was a real project and offered real benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a general issue that I hope that the Minister will address. The Millennium Commission is obliged to spend a certain percentage of its funds in Northern Ireland, but a sideswipe has completely negated it and the millennium projects that it was to fund. I hope that that decision will be reconsidered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.19 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There seems to be an opinion abroad in the House that everything flows from the Garvaghy Road incidents. People almost blame the weather in Northern Ireland on those Garvaghy Road incidents. We are a bit sick, sore and tired of the complete pillorying of people for something that they are not guilty of. I find it disturbing that a former spokesman for the Labour party said to some of my colleagues last night that if Drumcree ever happened again, he would bring in the tanks. When one hears such comments from a member of the Labour party who was once a spokesman for Northern Ireland, one wonders where we are going and where the Labour party is going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another thing that is commonly reported is that when the so-called ceasefire took place, there was an upsurge in getting jobs in Northern Ireland. The 10th annual economic and business review for Northern Ireland states clearly that those jobs that have been claimed as the harvest of the so-called peace process had been in the pipeline and were not determined by
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
the aftermath of the ceasefire at all. They were already arranged and provided for before there was any declaration by the IRA of the cessation of violence. We must remember that for every job promotion over the past 14 months by the Government and their agencies, there has been at least one actual job loss, be it in redundancies or lay-offs. It is rather insulting to be told about all those new opportunities when they did not come about. We must know the facts before we discuss these matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I find it difficult to tell my people that they must endure the cuts because they have to pay for a very high law and order bill. I wonder how many people in London have to pay for Canary wharf? How many people in Manchester have to pay for the Manchester bombing? It is a new Government policy to punish the innocent people—those who keep the law—because law breakers are at loose in our midst. I find that extremely disconcerting. It is the cause of deep resentment in the hearts of the people of Northern Ireland. God knows, the communities in Northern Ireland have suffered enough without being insulted in the House of their so-called friends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish that those who come to Northern Ireland would listen. We heard that the Prime Minister was forced to make a decision. At least he listened; at least he put up his hands and said, "I surrender"; at least he said, "I am not going to proceed along this road". I wish that other hon. Members who are prominent speakers on Northern Ireland in the House would also listen and learn what is really happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The economic picture in Northern Ireland is not good; no matter what is said. It does not have a good employment record. Northern Ireland has great difficulties. I am glad that Europe at least has given a good chunk of money to Northern Ireland, but we will be in great danger of not getting that chunk of money renewed for another three years if we are not careful. The Government need to take that on board. They need to see that that money bears fruit. That fruit must be seen so that, when Commissioners and officials visit, we can say, "There is the result of the money that you gave".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak for a moment about education. I am alarmed by a matter that various party leaders have mentioned to the Prime Minister—the cuts in arrangements at Queen's university for bases to investigate ways and means of improving our activity in the business world, and particularly in manufacturing.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that it is short-sighted of the Government to cut research funding, which enables our universities to match more than pound for pound the grant that they receive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is an absolute tragedy. The university's vice-chancellor told some of us when we came over on the plane to meet the Prime Minister that the first thing that new people ask when they arrive is, "What research facilities do you have?" Facilities have been cut to the bone. That process needs to be put into reverse and there must be immediate action. If we are to attract people to Northern Ireland, we must be able
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0598">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
to present them with research opportunities and other incentives that will help them to decide in favour of the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been much discussion on the education and library boards, and much money has been spent on examining the matter. I and others spoke to the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Devizes but he did not listen. He made up his mind that he would ram-stam the three boards—there used to be five—and at one meeting that I attended, he was asked a simple question about what he thought the changeover would mean in regard to transport, headquarters and other matters. He said, "I cannot give you a price tag for that—we do not have one." He was proposing to launch us into changes, but the Government had not done their sums. I am glad that that has not come about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor) said that he did not campaign. My son stood in for me in a deputation that went with the hon. Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume) to see the Minister in Rathgael. That day, in the Forum, the right hon. Gentleman said to me, "I am surprised that your son is going with John Hume to get an arrangement that will put certain boards into nationalist hands." He said that to others, too, and I want him, therefore, to ask the Labour spokesman, "Will you do that?"
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We do not want our education system to be run by people who are not prepared to listen to those who are involved in its operation. The overwhelming voice of those in education—parents, teachers, board members and everyone who is employed in education—says no to that. The issue crosses the political divide and has nothing to do with nationalism or unionism. Indeed, while the SDLP, the party of the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Dr. Hendron) would not come to the Forum, SDLP officers and boards assisted the Forum when it prepared its brief. Co-operation was across the board and the job was done. I hope that this or any future Government, whether it be Labour or Tory, will not go back on that, but will get down to the proper business of dealing with education. The right hon. Member for Peterborough (Dr. Mawhinney) did enough damage with his draft order—a huge volume, nearly the size of the "Encyclopaedia Britannica"— which we were given an hour and a half to debate. We do not want a reoccurrence of that. Let us talk to the people who know something about what is being done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the tragedy of the health cuts and what they mean. Home help services are being cut: a person who has had a home help for a couple of hours a day is now limited to half an hour. All home helps can do is light the fire, make a cup of tea and say goodbye. That is not home help service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are also reductions in meals on wheels and in key staff working in the community—the social workers and those working in day centres. We have the threatened closure of luncheon clubs. There are waiting lists for funding for domiciliary care packages and residential care. Craigavon hospital is talking about the loss of 100 jobs. The Royal Victoria hospital
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
has announced that it will not carry out non-emergency surgery on patients from non-fundholding general practitioners. The Ulster hospital carries out cancer procedures on such patients free of charge. The Western health board has cut its bypass operations by 10 per cent., its joint replacement operations by 20 per cent. and its ENT operations by 20 per cent. That is a catalogue of the tragedy that is going on in Northern Ireland with these health cuts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Mater hospital has announced that it cannot treat 390 patients who are awaiting general surgery and other treatments. The United hospitals trust plans to cut 14 surgical beds. The Route and Coleraine hospitals have suspended non-emergency operations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I heard the Minister's announcement about the Causeway hospital, for which we are grateful, but it should be considered in context. For years, the health boards starved those areas of finance—the buildings in the Coleraine hospital grounds show just how badly. These matters concern us all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, West is right to fight for his area—we all fight for our areas—but Unionist dominated areas receive less investment than those dominated by nationalists. In the period 1993–96, there were only four inward investment programmes in my area. It must be remembered that the top of my area is strongly nationalist. We had a meeting with Baroness Denton the other day and she told us all the good things that she was doing. Then we presented her with the figures. From a sum of about £200 million or £300 million that had been spent across the Province, the Moyle council area received the piddling sum of £100,000. North Antrim received a total of £20,955, which created eight jobs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, West did better—800 jobs were created in his area. In Foyle, there were 15 projects, with 2,500 jobs sponsored. Those are some figures, are they not? Newry and Armagh had seven projects and 500 jobs and South Down had 11 projects and 2,000 jobs. When Unionists stand up and tell the people here just what is happening, we should like some response. Do they not like the colour of people's skin in the Unionist constituencies? Why is this happening?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Direct grant aid is a different matter, on which hon. Members and the councils can do their work well. In my area, we were able to secure £4 million for rural and urban constituency work. But there is no room for complacency. The Local Enterprise Development Unit must become more proactive and generous in its grant aids to businesses in Union-dominated areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us have fair play all round. I am not against the constituents of the hon. Member for Belfast, West having jobs. People should work; Satan finds plenty for idle hands to do, so the sooner people have work, the better. I am not against people having decent housing, but I remind the Committee that the worst housing in Belfast was not in the hon. Gentleman's constituency but in the heartland of Sandy Row. That area had the worst housing in Northern Ireland, so do not tell us that the Protestant people had favour in housing and that the Roman Catholic people had not.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
They both suffered; I know that because my wife represented that area for eight years on Belfast corporation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are a few of the concerns that I and the people whom I represent have about the spending package, and especially about the cuts.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) for his observations, which are pertinent to the amount of money that is being spent in Northern Ireland. As he said, there is a real reduction of about 1.5 per cent., whereas the rest of the United Kingdom is receiving an increase—albeit modest—of 0.5 per cent. As he rightly pointed out, that is a significant difference.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also endorse the hon. Gentleman's observation that crude per capita comparisons offer us little assistance, especially when we bear in mind the fact that the level of unemployment in Northern Ireland is 10.8 per cent., as opposed to approximately 6.8 per cent. in England and 7.7 per cent. in Scotland and Wales. As has been said, we also suffer from geographical difficulties. The consequent higher costs of raw materials and other items increase our difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are specific observations but the Committee should deal with not so much the symptomatology of what is going on in Northern Ireland as with the fundamental condition or malaise that has given rise to many of the economic difficulties and the alleged realignment of expenditure that has brought about such a plethora of complaints. There have been suggestions that because there was rioting in east Belfast and Londonderry following the Garvaghy Road incident sums such as £120 million are being bruited. That is open to serious questioning. We should ask ourselves how to cure the fundamental condition that, in my view, gives rise to such disturbances, which, it is alleged, have led to the withdrawal of funds from education, health, housing and schemes to assist the long-term unemployed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the Opposition have supported a bipartisan policy on Northern Ireland, a policy that has patently failed. It has done nothing but unrealistically increase the expectations of the minority community and has fanned the anxiety—some would say paranoia—of the majority community. It has given rise to the worst inter-community relations in Northern Ireland since 1969. Never have divisions been deeper; never has the bitterness between the two communities been more acute.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The incident that is alleged to have given rise to the abnormal expenditure at the Garvaghy Road can be entirely attributed to Government policies, policies that have unfortunately been supported, in a naive and bipartisan way, by the Labour party. It has been rightly said that when the House is in unctuous agreement about its policies, someone somewhere is receiving a raw deal. In this case, it is the people of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
Let us examine the principle on which it is alleged that that money should be extracted from the funds available for education, housing, health and the long-term unemployed. It is because some criminal elements in Northern Ireland created public disturbances that cost a lot of money that the most vulnerable people in society—the sick, the young, the long-term unemployed—are being punished, as if on a hostage principle. That is tantamount to a policy of penalising those who observe the law for the criminal activities of those who break it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I compare the Government's attitude to the cost of law and order on the mainland to their policies in Northern Ireland, which seem to have been adopted as a sort of retribution against the most vulnerable sections of society in Northern Ireland. Let us consider, for example, the Labour party's attitude to the poll tax. That tax was bitterly opposed by a substantial section of the people of Northern Ireland and of the United Kingdom generally. Those people were, of course, first-class citizens—people who had access to the Government and the Opposition, people who had a vote that could put one party in power and the other out of power. Those who protested did so not only by observing the law but also by violently breaching the law. But did we hear the Labour party condemn that as it condemns the alleged breaches of law at Garvaghy Road? No, we did not, because those who were protesting about that unjust tax were real citizens with a real vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I sat on the Committee that considered that legislation, and we opposed it from the beginning. Not only were there demonstrations outside the House, there was politial opposition inside. The real problem with the poll tax was that it could not be collected. It was a tax on heads, and if the people were not there it could not be collected. The hon. and learned Gentleman is not making a fair comparison. There were extenuating circumstances with regard to the poll tax, which was doomed to failure before it started.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

He established in his intervention what I was saying—that there was effective political opposition in the House to what was perceived by a substantial number of people as an unfair and unjust tax. My argument about bipartisan policy is that the majority of people in Northern Ireland have the benefit of support from neither the Government nor the Opposition. To that extent, they are effectively disenfranchised. When that happens to people and the Government refuse to listen to what they say or acknowledge their peaceful protests, few political scientists or commentators would not observe
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
that the Government have a serious problem with the preservation of law and order. That is what happened in the Garvaghy road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been observed by a member of the Committee that the money allotted generally for security purposes was not the subject of debate; it was treated as a separate item from the money to be spent on other matters that have been debated in Committee. Yet, when it came to trying to establish that a failed policy was a good policy, it was suggested that all the money had to be spent because the people of Northern Ireland, or a large majority of them, were law breakers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) illustrated one of the propaganda frauds that was being perpetrated in relation to jobs that were already in the pipeline for Northern Ireland, long before the Garvaghy road had any influence. The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) made a good point when he said that, because Northern Ireland under the block grant will be suffering an effective reduction of about 1.5 per cent. on average and because the money for law and order is being abstracted from that block grant, the money available for education, health, the environment and housing will be reduced even further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both the Government and the Oppositon should consider seriously the political policies that they are pursuing for Northern Ireland. They should be looking with a great deal of detachment at the policies' knock-on effect on economic matters and on the availability of money. Money should be utilised not for the benefit of the pro-Union community or the pro-nationalist community; it should be available for the benefit of the entire community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The absence of real enfranchisement in Northern Ireland has been demonstrated recently by the joint efforts of all the political parties—Nationalist and Unionist—as has the fact that Northern Ireland is a bureaucrat's paradise with no effective accountability. A combined nationalist and Unionist application to the Prime Minister about the reorganisation of the health boards effectively had the scheme of the Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram), put on hold, if not postponed indefinitely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, the combined efforts of all the parties in Northern Ireland—of all 17 Members of Parliament—protesting about the draconian cuts to the adult community employment scheme were not successful. All the parties in Northern Ireland were, for once, working in harmony and protesting about a Government cut, which, as the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie described, was simply cut by a percentage without any demonstration or analysis of the basis for that cut. Despite the protests of every elected Member of Parliament for every Northern Ireland constituency that that was not in the interests of any of their constituents, nationalist or Unionist, the Government ignored them entirely. It is that lack of accountability in Northern Ireland—that failure of Government Departments to explain, consult on and
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
be accountable for their actions—that will continue to plague not only political stability but the proper use of funds made available to the Province.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has rightly been stated this morning that the public expenditure proposals for Northern Ireland involve a cut in expenditure not only this year but for every year until 2000. We must acknowledge that those cuts would also be introduced by a future Labour Government. The Labour party Treasury spokesman made it perfectly clear in a speech a week ago that he would maintain the public expenditure cuts proposed by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Northern Ireland know why that is the case; it is because both parties—Conservative and Labour—are endeavouring to comply with the criteria of the Maastricht agreement by introducing restrictions on public expenditure. Even if they have not decided whether to proceed with the single currency, they want to have in place the means whereby they can do so later if they so decide. That is the real reason why cuts in public expenditure in Northern Ireland are proposed by the Government, and would be proposed by a future Labour Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It was interesting that one announcement by the hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie was that a Labour Government would stand by the Prime Minister's recent decision that the five area education boards in Northern Ireland should remain. I must say for the record that, had the hon. Member for North Antrim followed the minutes of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland, he would have known that I was one of the most active members of the committee in fighting to retain the five area boards. I received a letter of thanks from the board in my area—the southeastern education board—for the fight that I put up. I was joined in that campaigne by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wrote to support the retention of the southern area board, as Mr. Kelly, its chief executive, can confirm. I was sorry that the hon. Member for North Antrim, as is his wont now and again, referred in public to a confidential discussion. I must make it clear that, unlike him, I do not consider all Catholics to be nationalists. I never referred to education boards falling under nationalist control; I was talking about representations made to me by leading members of the main Protestant churches in Northern Ireland in relation to the Council of Catholic Maintained Schools. That is what we were talking about, and I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman went out of his way to misrepresent me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The public expenditure proposal have received some criticism in Nortern Ireland. I am glad not only that we have that decision on the education boards by the Labour party, but that the Government have reversed at least one decision—the proposed closure of the veterinary station in Omagh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As someone who also campaigned on that issue by asking questions in the House and elsewhere, I want to place on record our appreciation of that decision. The agricultural community and the veterinary professions in Northern Ireland greatly resented the original proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to address the issue of public expenditure cuts. Are we getting our priorities right in that regard? I want more meetings of the Grand Committee, so that we can share with the Government our proposals for expenditure in Northern Ireland. Is it right for example, that £5.5 million is to be spent on a motorway telephone system, while more important and urgent schemes are placed further down the list of priorities? An example of that in my constituency is the Comber bypass, which will cost £2.5 million. Because that project has been delayed year after year and there is still no bypass, the centre of the town is getting choked and 30 per cent. of the shops are to let or for sale. The economy of the town is collapsing because of the lack of investment in the bypass, yet the Government can upgrade motorway telephones on the M1 at a cost of £5.5 million. One could provide 110,000 mobile phones for the same price. Even if one or two were stolen, a few mobile phones along the motorway would be a much better way of saving money, which could be used for the Comber bypass and other important road schemes in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie mentioned the private finance initiative. Over ten days ago, I tabled a question on the progress of PFI in Northern Ireland because I am particularly concerned about the lack of progress on it but my question has still not been answered—perhaps that is not surprising because the Northern Ireland Office has the reputation of being the slowest Department to answer questions. I want to see expenditure allocated to the Ulster hospital, for example, which is the same size as the Belfast City hospital, with the same number of births per year—just over 2,000; yet £85 million a year goes to the City hospital, while the Ulster hospital gets only £58 million. I know that the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) is a supporter of the City hospital. We want a reallocation of funds within the eastern board, but we also need capital investment—the Royal Victoria hospital in Belfast received lots of capital investment, but the Ulster hospital received none. Why not? We need an explanation and we need to examine whether PFI can come to our assistance, as has been recommended for the new hospital in Downpatrick.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
On the Dundonald training centre, a subject that is still open, the closure of the centre was recommended in the public expenditure proposals; by asking a question in the House I discovered that that would save £0.5 million—yet, I repeat, £5.5 million is going on motorway telephones. That is the only training centre serving North Down, Belfast, East and Strangford constituencies. There are only ten centres in Northern Ireland, but the one serving the main Unionist area is being closed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman confirm that, while that centre is being closed, a sum of perhaps 20 times the amount that will be saved is being spent on a new bureaucratic palace for the Department of Education in Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman is correct. Again, I asked a question about that only last week and, although the Government confirmed that so much money was being spent on new capital investment at Rathgael, they argue that it is to rehouse civil servants who are not in satisfactory accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the more serious issue of Dundonald training centre, which trains some 300 young people, for occupations, including plastering and bricklaying, for which no training is available elsewhere. We are now told that that centre will be closed because it is not needed, even though the number of people attending it has increased for the past three years. We are told that those people can go to Lisburn, but that is not convenient. You know Lisburn very well, Sir James. The road from Lisburn to Newtownards is not very accessible and it is expensive for young people to travel from Bangor or Newtownards to Lisburn. I want the Government to reconsider the proposed closure of Dundonald training centre.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Adult community employment schemes have been mentioned, but one aspect was not referred to—the fact that they have been most successful in dealing with long-term unemployment in Northern Ireland. Some 50 per cent. of people on ACE schemes find employment. The long-term unemployment problem in Northern Ireland is worse than anywhere else in the United Kingdom. The unemployment rate of those who have been unemployed for more than three years is twice that of Great Britain. The unemployment rate of those who have been unemployed for more than five years is three times greater than in the rest of the United Kingdom. Everyone, irrespective of party—whether Democratic Unionist, Social Democratic and Labour, United Kingdom Unionist or Ulster Unionist—agrees that ACE schemes have been a success in Northern Ireland, and the Government should consider that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Education is another issue. There is a terrible problem in primary schools in Northern Ireland. I have visited more than 20 schools—both Catholic and state-controlled—in my constituency during the past year. Every one of them has budgetary problems which will lead to redundancies among the teaching staff and a reduction of facilities for the children. More money needs to be allocated to education.

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Regent House grammar school in Newtownards, which has 1,700 pupils, has received not one penny of capital investment since the Stormont Parliament was dissolved in 1972, yet it is one of the largest grammar schools in Northern Ireland. Money is going to other schools which are not as big—perhaps they should not have such priority—but, for unexplained reasons, one of the largest grammar schools in Northern Ireland keeps being rejected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to conclude on the question of priorities. I have mentioned the £5.5 million spent on motorway telephones instead of investing in road schemes which would produce further economic development, but the Government recently gave £4 million to the Northern Ireland Film Council. I am not against encouraging the film industry in Northern Ireland, but we must get our priorities right. Is it better to give £4 million to the Northern Ireland Film Council and £5.5 million to putting telephones on the motorway than to invest more money in hospitals, schools or in such things as the Comber bypass? Those priorities are wrong.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned that 30 per cent. of the overall expenditure in Northern Ireland goes on social service benefits—that is, 30 per cent. of £8 billion. That is an astounding proportion of total public expenditure in Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for North Antrim mentioned European money.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ken Maginnis 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way on the issue of social security benefits. Is it not time in Northern Ireland to tighten up on who receives social security benefits? Is it not a fact that Adria—a company based for many years in the Strabane area, which is supposed to be an unemployment blackspot—was unable to expand its operation there and had to move to another part of Northern Ireland to find enough people who were available for work?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. I do not know the details of the case, but I remember reading abut Adria and being amazed to hear that it could not find people to employ in the Strabane area. Strabane has recently been in the news in relation to the effects of new industry, following recent events.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been talking about how more money could be spent in schools, in hospitals and on roads and criticising some of the priorities on which the Government decided, such as the bill for motorway telephones, but as I have said, 30 per cent. of public expenditure goes on social security benefits.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Europe gives us about £200 million a year, leaving aside the peace and reconciliation fund, to which the hon. Member for North Antrim referred. The United Kingdom Government contribute £4 billion of the £8 billion spent in Northern Ireland. In other words, much as we welcome European money it is negligible in comparison with the benefits of being part of the United Kingdom. Everyone in Northern Ireland, irrespective of religion, should understand that simple economic point. But one begins to wonder what is happening when one finds that 30 per cent. of the £8
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
billion is spent on social security benefits. More of that £8 billion should be spent on training and on the public services which I have mentioned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I had an analysis carried out, once again in connection with a parliametary question, on social security benefits in Northern Ireland, constituency by constituency. It showed that there are only 482 claimants of severe disablement allowance in Belfast, South. Top of the league with 1,243—three times the number—is Foyle. Belfast, South does not consist solely of the Malone road. It contains areas with considerable social problems, yet it has only a third of the number of successful applicants in Foyle. The constituency with the lowest number of incapacity benefit claimants is Belfast, South with just 3,412 successful applicants, but the one with the highest—a similar-sized constituency—is Foyle, with 8,179. The second highest is Mid-Ulster, with 6,910.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The worst disparity arises with disability living allowance. The constituency with the lowest number of successful applicants is North Down, with 3,721. But Foyle and Belfast, West have three times that number, with 10,157 and 10,297 respectively. Why is there three times more disability in Belfast, West than in Belfast, South? There seems to be something peculiar going on. There should not be such great variation in disability between constituencies represented by Social Democractic and Labour party and Ulster Unionist party Members of Parliament, but that is the way in which it works out.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend accept that Belfast, South has the fourth highest unemployment and the greatest number of female unemployed? In addition, there is a fair concentration of disability in that area because the headquarters of Disability in Action is there.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That makes the point absolutely. There are social conditions in Belfast, South which require addressing by the Government. I accept that those problems also apply in Belfast, West and in Foyle, but they cannot in reality be three times worse. As 30 per cent. of public expenditure goes on social security benefits, I am calling on the Government to carry out a proper public inquiry into the administration of the social security benefits scheme in Northern Ireland. If there were a proper investigation of why there are three times as many claimants in Foyle as in Belfast, South hundreds of millions of pounds of savings would be found every year. More money could be invested in schools and hospitals and in projects such as the Comber bypass.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I listened carefully to the debate and did not intend to refer to Drumcree or Garvaghy road, but others have done so. I probably know the territory better than most members of the Committee. My father is
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
buried in the Catholic churchyard there. However, that is not relevant to the debate. In my lifetime I have rarely seen anything that has caused so much division in our communities as what happened in Drumcree. What hon. Members have said about people stirring up matters is true. Whether one calls them IRA or Sinn Fein, there were people looking for trouble and we also saw them in other parts of Northern Ireland. That does not detract from the fact that the great majority of the Catholic and nationalist people were deeply hurt by what happened on that day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The knock-on effect, which is relevant to what we are discussing, was that many roads across the north of Ireland were blocked by thugs. The most alarming feature was that in some cases roads were blocked by two, three or four people and for some reason the police were taking little or no action. I never get any pleasure from criticising the police. I appreciate their difficulty in policing a divided community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will come later to the remarks of the right hon. Member for Strangford. There was a reference to what happened on the Ormeau road the day after the events at Drumcree. Again, people were trying to stir up matters there, but the handling of the situation by the authorities was a disaster. I spoke to the Secretary of State on 12 July, the night before those events, about what might happen on 13 July.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's remark that decent Catholic people were hurt. Will he enlarge on that? How were they hurt? Were they hurt because the Orangemen marched past their church on the way up and could not march past it on the way down? I have heard that remark before and I should like to know what hurt the Roman Catholic population. The hon. Gentleman knows that I have been in contact with them and that many have said that they would have been happy if that parade had returned from the church to which it marched.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Hendron</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The main problem was that people felt that a raw nerve had been touched and that there should have been discussions with them in advance. I accept that there were self-appointed people who said that they were the spokespersons for the Garvaghy road. The same applied elsewhere. To answer the hon. Gentleman's question, people felt hurt because they were not consulted and I found that, overall, they were nationalist people. That point has arisen over the years. I am not making an attack on the Orange Order. I am saying simply that in many cases in the north there was great hurt because a section of that organisation—I emphasise the word "section"—was engaged in coat-trailing. That does not apply to the majority of the members of the Orange Order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I move on to law and order and its costs, particularly the cost of joy riding, which is a terrible expression. In and around my constituency, I have found that the
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
organisation that played a major part in starting joy riding in stolen cars was the Provisional IRA. The same can be said of paramilitaries on the loyalist side. The organisation that, more than any other, was stealing cars, getting young people to do its dirty work and then training them to be members of the paramilitaries is now taking control in west Belfast. I view that seriously. I have said many times publicly that the police have totally ignored that problem. The Minister knows exactly what I am talking about because I have discussed the matter with him. I deeply resent the fact that in areas such as Twinbrook vigilante thugs are going around smashing young people's legs, although it is true that such young people are a menace to society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was at a public meeting of about 800 people, who were mostly Sinn Fein people. I took much abuse but I do not mind that because I have been taking it for years and I can accept it. I feel angry that the forces of law and order have ignored ordinary, decent people who have made endless phone calls day after day and night after night. I accept that as there is no ceasefire, police officers' lives are in danger. I understand that; it has been a major problem down the years. But even allowing for that—and I acknowledge that it is a big allowance—the police have not been taking the action that they should. I appreciate that the Minister told me that he is examining the matter. Unfortunately, the IRA and Sinn Fein are gaining politically because they have made it into a massive election platform issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noticed in yesterday's 	<i>Irish News</i> that a prominent Sinn Fein member, Mr. Adams, made reference to the International Fund for Ireland and said that not enough of that money was coming to west Belfast. That may or may not be so. I am well aware of the comments that the right hon. Member for Strangford has made at various times on the International Fund for Ireland. There was also an article in 	<i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday about the Commission in Brussels, to which the hon. Member for North Antrim referred. It said that European funding—the peace money—was in big danger because of continuing IRA violence. What happened in the summer was not helpful either, although I do not want to keep resurrecting the subject. I am very worried about funding. Sinn Fein members are telling the world about deprivation, but they are one of the main causes of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members have spoken about the cuts in the ACE schemes. I remind them, as I have before, about the tale of one city, the major economic report which was written by two top economists from the University of Ulster and funded by "Make Belfast Work". I know that the Government will get round to answering that report's recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to F. G. Wilson in west Belfast earlier. It is a world-class organisation by any standards, but when the chief executive of the Springvale training centre, which was set up some years ago and which we were all very proud of, tells me that she is acutely embarrassed at her inability properly to train people for F. G. Wilson, there is something seriously wrong. The training centre was hit by an IRA rocket a few weeks ago, which does not help matters.

In July 1988 the then Secretary of State announced the "Make Belfast Work" scheme and a similar organisation for Derry. I accept, as the Secretary of State said in his statement on 10 December, that targeting social need is not a specific programme or programmes. It is more a principle that is applied to other programmes. Having said that, deprivation is to be found in areas such as west Belfast and parts of north Belfast—both sides of the Shankill road. In the past 20 years, more people per 1,000 of the population have died through violence in the territory of west and north Belfast than anywhere else in western Europe—leaving aside the situation in the former Yugoslavia. More people are in prison per 1,000 of population and there is more ill health. One could go on and on. By any social criteria, those areas are deprived, and yet the cuts are applied across the north and in areas where we are supposed to be targeting social need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The care of the elderly is a massive subject, which I shall just touch on. It is sad and pathetic to see home help provision to elderly people being reduced to perhaps half an hour on two or three days a week. Hon. Members have already spoken about meals on wheels and residential care. Reference was also made to the disability living allowance, which, with my medical hat on, I know something about. I would expect the figures for those claiming disability living allowance to be higher in areas such as west Belfast and part of north Belfast, in particular New Lodge and Shankill road. I am sure that there is deprivation on parts of the Ormeau road and other parts of south Belfast, with accompanying ill health and more people claiming disability living allowance. I do not see anything wrong with their doing that. I do not criticise the people who decide the levels of that allowance: my office is in contact with them every day and I know that they have to keep to strict criteria. They apply the rules fairly across the board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Antrim referred to the Causeway hospital. I welcomed the decision to go ahead with that hospital. That was a great exercise in cross-community effort. As my party's health spokesman, I was involved with the hon. Gentleman—and with the leader of the Alliance party and the hon. Members for Belfast, South and for Mid-Ulster (Rev. William McCrea)—in that tremendous effort, which took a period of years. I pay tribute to the various councils around north Antrim and to Mr. John Robb, the former surgeon who co-ordinated much of the effort.

The cost of drugs per person in Northern Ireland is £103, as against £71 in Britain generally. The Secretary of State's document goes on to say that, even allowing for more ill health, that is still a big difference. I believe that that difference can be reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hospitals accept patients referred by fundholders but not those referred by non-fundholders. That came about because the finance for fundholders' patients was ring fenced, whereas the money for non-fundholders' patients was not. Half the doctors in Northern Ireland are non-fundholders. The situation
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
is very wrong, but it is not the fault of the hospital trusts. They do not have the money to deal with all the patients, so the fault resides with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not say much about the Royal Maternity hospital, which I have discussed before in an Adjournment debate. However, when the Government make their decision, I hope that they will be wise enough to keep that great hospital. Of course, every Member of Parliament considers the hospitals in his area to be great, but the Royal Maternity hospital's neonatal unit—which looks after sick and premature babies—serves the whole of Northern Ireland. To move that unit to the tower block of the Belfast City hospital would be a massive step backwards because it would take the neonatal unit away from the paediatric specialties of the Royal Childrens hospital.

Finally, literacy and numeracy are by far the biggest problems in our education system. The paramilitaries on both sides get their people from areas of deprivation—the nationalists from the housing estates on the Falls road and the loyalists from estates such as Springmartin. That is where the problems are. I have discussed questions of numeracy and literacy with representatives of the Shankill road: those important problems must be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposed Malone intergrated college seems to be going ahead with great speed. In no way do I oppose integrated education: there is a strong argument in favour of such education and I support parental choice in those matters. But in my area of west Belfast there are two other major schools—St. Genevieve's and La Salle. The Northern Ireland Office is unwilling to spend the relatively paltry sum of £2.4 million to rebuild those institutions in the green area of Trench house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have taken that matter up with the Secretary of State and with the Minister and will not take it any further now. However, schools in west Belfast are worried about that. I want to make it clear that I do not oppose the Malone integrated college, but I want an explanation of why it is proceeding with all speed when there is such hesitation about other educational matters in west Belfast.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Each of us is glad to have the opportunity to deal with a vital aspect of our responsibilities towards our constituencies and the Province as a whole. That opportunity falls directly from the consultations that all our parties have had with the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is sad that such a significant Government statement was released to the public through a press conference, instead of coming to the House or a Committee, where it would have been open to hon. Members' questions and scrutiny. The fact that the Secretary of State and his Ministers took the press on one side, in the hope that they would not be subject to the same questioning and scrutiny that they would

I hope that I will not be disappointed and that the Government will accept the validity of that argument and do for Northern Ireland what they have already done for Scotland.

It was inevitable that the Garvaghy road problem would be raised in a debate such as this. Many people in Northern Ireland will greatly regret the threats that residents of Garvaghy road made; they have led to many problems over the past years, although particularly last year. Many people recognise that a significant part of the cost of the Garvaghy road problem arose after the Orange men had walked down it. The violence that occured in nationalist areas made up a significant—indeed, the most significant—proportion of the overall cost.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There was less of a cry from the Government during 25 years of IRA violence, with all the effects that that has on the United Kingdom economy, that there was about what the Labour spokesman described as "a week of madness and a lifetime of regret". I hope that policies will not be introduced that lead to incidents such as those that we had last summer. I hope that people's fundamental rights will be recognised and that they will be at liberty to walk on the Queen's highway. If people want to protest, they could then do so peacefully and legitimately.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make some comments directly in relation to some of the elements of the Government's statement on public expenditure for 1997–98 to 1999–2000. In particular, I would like to follow the remarks made by several members of the Committee on the health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Along with the hon. and learned Member for North Down and the right hon. Member for Strangford, I have had a number of meetings about the health service at various levels in the North Down, Strangford and east Belfast areas. We were all appalled at the level of funding and the impact of the reduction
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
in funding for the health service in the area. There are major problems for the Ulster hospital, for instance. I do not want the right hon. Member for Strangford and the hon. Member for Belfast, South to come to blows. They were getting close to it a while ago regarding the City hospital and the Ulster hospital. However, one cannot look at the comparable fundings and say that the Ulster hospital has been getting a fair deal. It has not been getting its appropriate proportion of the funding from the Eastern board. Nor has the Eastern board been getting its share of the overall funding for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that Northern Ireland as a whole is being under-funded by the Government. The problem increases as it gets further down the line, to the stage where the Ulster hospital would have had to sack 200 nurses at the end of last month if our plea for more finance had not been met with a small amount, even though that will still mean a deficit for the Ulster hospital at the end of this financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
These serious problems mean that non-emergency cases cannot be dealt with. People have been waiting for vital operations for a very long time, and they just get put off. The central aspect of any health service should be that whether people live in Donacloney or Dundonald, they should receive exactly the same level of service. That is not happening, and it is vital to have a level playing field—I think that that is the in term—in the Northern Ireland health service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) commented on the home help service. I have almost daily complaints at my advice centre from people who find that their home help can come in for only half an hour. In that time, they are supposed to light the fire, get the person washed and dressed and set up their meal for them. That is impossible. The Government are relying on the charity and good nature of those who work in the home help system to do all that is necessary, and to call back in their own time to see whether the elderly person is all right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is not the proper way to deal with the home help service. It definitely needs more funding. Indeed, a number of members of Belfast city council were even prepared to act ultra vires to the council's powers by putting money into the home help service that came out of the council's funding. They were preprared to increase the rates to improve the home help service. That is the state that has been reached in the Belfast area, and it is deplorable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of comments have also been made on the education budget. Do members of the Committee know just how bad the problem is in funding capital projects in Northern Ireland? Belmont primary school in my constituency probably breaks every fire regulation, yet children attend the school daily. They have no immediate access to fire escapes and there are no toilets within the school block. If a child wants to go to the toilet on a rainy day, the teacher has to leave the other children behind in the classroom, get the child's coat and walk him across the playground to the toilet, which is in a portakabin. It is Dickensian. Conditions are so bad that the electrics often break
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
down, so they are left without lighting, and the heating is also less than adequate. Yet the Minister was not prepared to give the school funding in last year's capital programme. I hope that he will do so in this year's programme. I notice that the inspectorate has again this year reported adversely on the state of that school. At grass-roots level, there is a serious need for Departments to provide more funds for health and education facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has also been made to the boards. It is necessary to consider how education in Northern Ireland is structured. No one who knows anything about education thinks that that structure or the amount of money spent on administration—instead of on pupils and education—is satisfactory. There is overall agreement among elected representatives in Northern Ireland that the appropriate time to deal with that is when we have an elected body in Northern Ireland, when people who know something about what is occurring in education in Northern Ireland and who are accountable to people in Northern Ireland can make the changes themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On the question of the boards, my hon. Friend was in the House when I made a speech referring to the right hon. Member for Strangford. The right hon. Gentleman did not ask me to give way; if he had, I should have done so. When he made his speech, he would not give way; he thought that I would not have an opportunity to reply. I want to say one thing: the conversation was not confidential. Many members of the Forum heard the conversation, which occurred once the Forum was adjourned. What is more, that throws an interesting sidelight on ecumenical clergymen, who, after professing their love for their Roman Catholic brethren, say, "We need to take care about these boards boys and what these people do." That throws a most interesting sidelight on ecumenism. I stand by all that I have said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The idea of canons, moderators and others sitting down to count the number of Prods and Taigs in each area is a pretty picture indeed. I was glad to see that people across the community—nationalist and Unionist, Protestant and Catholic—were united on the issue. The very fact that they were united caused the Prime Minister to put up his hands and surrender. If we could unite on BSE and other issues, the Prime Minister might accede to the special case that can be made for Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the labour market heading in the public expenditure document, I am appalled that the Government should effectively cut out the jobs of
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
4,000 or 5,000 people at the stroke of a pen. That will have the same impact as if they were to shut the shipyard down twice, but because of how it is done, it will not attract the same headlines in the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> or the 	<i>Irish News.</i> The loss of 2,000 places from the ACE schemes will have a devastating effect in Northern Ireland. That means that people who are at the bottom rung of the ladder, trying to get into employment, will have the ladder kicked away from them by the Government. It is atrocious that the Government should behave in that way. Many of us believe that the cut of 2,000 places is just the start and that there will be a meltdown of the whole ACE scheme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the effect of the cuts in the ACE scheme—a scheme designed to help the long-term unemployed—will be exacerbated by their being made when the jobseekers legislation is throwing more people into actively seeking employment? With no training, their prospects of obtaining employment are reduced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman makes the point well. A further 2,000 places are also to be cut from the job skills programme. I honestly do not know why the Government believe that the employment situation in Northern Ireland will benefit from taking away jobs at the training level. There is absolutely no justification in the document for closing the Dundonald training centre; I have yet to hear anything that comes remotely close to justifying that decision, which was taken for the sake of only £500,000. The wastage in each of the Government Departments would easily pay for that—the Ministers should spend a bit more time in Northern Ireland, consider those issues and make those savings.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman not think it ironic that training is being cut at a time when apprenticeships are getting shorter, especially as apprenticeships were supposed to be replaced by training in colleges?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. Ten days to two weeks ago, I attended a meeting of a group called G7—not the organisation that some hon. Members may be thinking of—which includes the Institute of Directors, the Confederation of British Industry, the chamber of commerce, the chamber of trade, trade unions and so on and meets elected representatives in Northern Ireland. It strongly makes the point that it is vital, if jobs are to be brought to Northern Ireland through inward investment, that we have the skills to attract those jobs. What do the Government do? They remove the base on which one can acquire those skills. That does not make sense. Indeed, if the proposals are implemented, they will have a devastating effect in the long term on employment in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that money for training in Northern Ireland should be spent exclusively on young people and the unemployed? If there was close scrutiny of those enrolled at training centres in certain areas of the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
Province, it might be discovered that phoney addresses are given that bear no relation to the place of origin of some of those who have enrolled.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has details that cause him to make that point. I do not believe that the money should be spent exclusively on young people, although they should undoubtedly be a priority. People who are put out of a job later in life recognise that they do not have the opportunity to be re-employed in their previous occupation; they need to be reskilled for some other type of employment. There is abuse, and it would be better if the Government found out where that abuse is rather than punish those who are genuinely using the procedures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. and learned Member for North Down said, no account is taken of a scheme's success; everyone is dealt with in the same way. A slice is taken off, no matter how successful or unsuccessful the venture has been.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman again, but he raises an important issue in referring to the reduction in the number of ACE schemes and job skills opportunities. Does he agree not only that the reductions will cause devastation across the Province, but that they are being implemented with no management? No account is being taken of the success of a scheme and performance indicators are being totally ignored. That broad-brush approach means that everyone has to give up his or her share, irrespective of the needs of particular regions or the performance of particular providers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman emphasises the point made by the hon. and learned Member for North Down, which is accurate and well made, and I hope that the Government will take it on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister listening to our debate today will inform his colleagues in Government in Northern Ireland of the importance of the schemes and, indeed, the importance that Northern Ireland Members attach to them. The Dundonald training centre closure should be reconsidered. I hope that the Government are not so firmly committed to the closure that they cannot retreat and do what is sensible. Next week, I shall join some council colleagues in speaking to the Minister, and I hope that he will have the courage to reverse the decision and recognise that that would be sensible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the hon. Member for Belfast, West should not have reminded me of it, but he referred in passing to the International Fund for Ireland—the "IFI money", as it is called in Northern Ireland—and the statement made by those opposed to him in west Belfast. I appreciate how difficult it must be for a Member of Parliament trying to work in the environment of west Belfast with Sinn Fein acting as it does.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman was right to draw attention to Gerry Adams' remarks about IFI, a matter touched on some time ago by the Select Committee on Northern Ireland. No matter whether it was a deliberate policy—I do not believe that it was—the funding from
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
the International Fund for Ireland was going overwhelmingly to nationalist areas. It was an incontrovertible fact; everyone knew that that was happening. The organisation's documentation showed that it was happening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Gerry Adams, however, attacked the IFI for not putting enough money into nationalist areas. The position was absolutely crazy and bore no relation to the fact. The IFI was so aware of the imbalance that it has, I am glad to say, become more pro-active in Unionist areas. It has talked to us in east Belfast about schemes that could be started to which it would donate funds. I, along with the right hon. Member for Strangford, argued in the Select Committee on Northern Ireland that the IFI should become proactive to try to redress the balance. I am glad that that has been happening and I hope that the IFI will not be intimidated by the IRA-Sinn Fein spokesman, who is telling it not to share out the money with anyone else but to keep it all in the nationalist areas. I hope that the IFI will stand up to the threats from Mr. Adams.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish finally to comment on millennium projects and lottery funds. Whether or not members of the Committee like it, significant funding is coming into Northern Ireland from lottery funding, as is happening in other parts of the United Kingdom. We receive one fortieth of that funding for sport and one fortieth for arts, but we are not receiving one fortieth in other areas, which is our right given the size of the population in Northern Ireland. We are not receiving our fair share for charities, heritage for millennium projects. The Government and the Department of National Heritage should be encouraged by Northern Ireland Office Ministers to ensure that the funding that should be coming to Northern Ireland is coming, instead of going to better-off parts of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have but a few minutes left to cover the many points that have been raised and I shall endeavour to make some progress. I shall begin my remarks by making a general comment on our debate. From the Government's point of view, it has been extremely
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
interesting and valuable. I am grateful to the seven hon. Members who have contributed so far to the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, I stated the Government's policy that, at a national level of spending, the percentage of gross domestic product is set at the Government's target of 40 per cent. or below for 1997–98. No member of the Committee who has spoken so far challenged that central proposition about the level of GDP. I also inquired whether hon. Members who intervened in the debate could help the Government provide alternatives for changes in the expenditure policies as they affect Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Strangford who asked whether the proposed expenditure of £5.5 million on motorway telephones could be reconsidered; I give him the assurance that it will be.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: And the film council?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Sir John Wheeler</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman referred to expenditure on the film council and I shall also have that looked into. The expenditure on social security, which has been raised to a substantial sum, also requires detailed analysis. I shall therefore take away from our debate two specific propositions and a general inquiry, which will require careful analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for North Down spoke about a lack of accountability. I agree; that has been a feature of the debate. I should like the elected representatives of Northern Ireland to have more direct accountability in some "forum" or mechanism so that proper, challenging consideration could be given to expenditure. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie seemed to place his expectations for future expenditure in what has come to be known as the "windfall tax". That tax will be a rubber band that stretches around the United Kingdom because it will, I understand, have to pay for 89 spending commitments, costing an estimated £30 billion. I am not sure whether the rubber band will stretch to all of it. The hon. Gentleman said that his party had no intention of increasing direct taxes; I am glad that salaries and wages are safe, but the hon. Gentleman and his fellow spokesmen have not said whether indirect taxes will go up. I warn the people of Northern Ireland to beware: they may think that their salaries are safe at present taxation levels, but their back pockets are about to be approached by a stealthy pair of hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie also said that the privatised companies—the utilities—would provide the windfall tax. I shall be specific because Northern Ireland has a direct interest in that statement; does that mean that Harland and Wolff and Shorts, which were returned to the private sector in 1989, will have to pay? How many jobs will be lost
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
because the successor companies will have to find the funding? That needs to be answered. What about the Department of Agriculture's artificial insemination service, which was privatised in 1988? Will the poor animals have to work harder in order to earn the extra money? And what about the Northern Ireland Electricity generation stations which were sold in 1992, with the remainder of the business floated in 1993? If one goes to that organisation for money, its charges will go up. The people of Northern Ireland will pay more for that £30 billion of funding. Finally, what about Northern Ireland Airports Ltd, the company that operates Belfast international airport, which is so beloved and familiar to many members of the Committee? I assume that an unknown bill will be delivered to that company, with "Pay to the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer the sum of X million pounds" written on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Who will pay? Members of the Committee will, because everyone who travels in and out of Northern Ireland will have to pay that money by some means or other. The Opposition should come clean. One cannot make such commitments and promises in which money grows on trees in Northern Ireland at no cost to anyone. That will not happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. and learned Member for North Down said, the feature of this debate is accountability. When time allows, I shall look in detail at some of the points that have been raised. There should be careful analysis of where money goes and whether there are alternative uses. There are tough choices to be made and they are not painless choices. If we are committed to spending 40 per cent. or less of gross domestic product, some things will have to go, some money will have to be better spent and some spending will be stopped altogether. There is no alternative to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with some of the specific points in the order in which they were mentioned. The hon. Member for Clydebank and Milngavie referred to BSE, which was debated at great length in the House yesterday. I shall not go into the detail of yesterday's debate, but I shall refer to the specific points he made about costs. The estimate of expenditure relating to BSE is about £176 million in Northern Ireland alone. He asked where that money comes from. Virtually all of it comes from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and very little comes from the Northern Ireland block, which is the direct concern of this Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Considerable concern has been expressed about the ACE scheme. The main aim of ACE is to provide temporary work for up to one year for long-term unemployed adults. The fact that ACE workers have undertaken projects that benefited the voluntary services in depressed areas has been an added bonus. Of course, that is one of the features that underline the concerns of Northern Ireland Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The ACE scheme was started in 1981 when unemployment stood at 16 per cent. compared with 9.2 per cent. now. The funding for 1997–98 will maintain approximately 5,000 ACE places. The resources devoted to the scheme must reflect the general labour market position, which is now very positive and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1996-1997V005P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
substantially different to what it was in 1981. The employment rate is the highest in Northern Ireland for many years. I think that the Committee would want to consider that a little more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Committee is not advocating that the scheme, which was set up in the early 1980s to deal with the then situation, should prevail in the late 1990s when the situation is very different. The Committee would want the money to be properly spent elsewhere in Northern Ireland, as indeed it is. Perhaps, on another occasion, I shall be fortunate enough to be able to speak in greater detail about that scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give further thought to the proposition on canal expenditure of the hon. Member for Upper Bann and see what might be possible. I am looking in great detail at the car crime problem, to which the hon. Member for Belfast, West referred. He was right; it is very serious. I am determined to assist the community in that area because that problem afflicts and affects not just west Belfast but all parts of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
	<p>12.59 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would like to ask the Minister whether, before we meet again, he will consider where the £3.5 million that was added to the health budget came from. I am keen to make savings and perhaps the Northern Ireland Office could have saved three pages of blank paper in the handout that it gave me on 15th December. I mention that example of waste, which we could do without, to show that it is still a problem that we must deal with.
