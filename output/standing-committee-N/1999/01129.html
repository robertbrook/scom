	<p>5 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the Review of the future of the juvenile justice centre estate, published by the Northern Ireland Office in March 2000.</p></blockquote></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It might help if I first set out some reasoning relating to the subject of our debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. We are here to consider the future of the juvenile justice centre estate in Northern Ireland, but in response to a parliamentary question yesterday, the Minister published a long written answer, which makes it clear that, regardless of what is said here today, he has already made up his mind. What is the point of this Committee proceeding at all? Is not his behaviour an outrageous abuse of the procedures of the House?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Nothing disorderly has happened. I have only just seen the document, but it is not disorderly in terms of the motion before the Committee. I have no power to suggest that Members should not refer to it, if they so wish, during their deliberations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You may not be aware of this, Mr. McWilliam, and there is no reason why you should be, but the fact is that the issue in question has been a matter of extensive consultation during which many representations were made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If the Minister is saying that I have not read all the relevant papers, I am sorry, but I have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am saying only that there is no reason why you should necessarily know all the detail, Mr. McWilliam. Knowing the way in which you go about your business in the Chair, it would be characteristic for you to be well aware of it. I meant only that there was no good reason for you to be aware of the full minutiae of an issue that goes back more than four years. It has been a matter of consultation and the purpose of setting it out before the Committee was to allow ventilation of opinion about the conclusions of that consultation. It could have been dealt with simply by a parliamentary answer. I regret that the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) feels that this Committee is an inappropriate place in which to
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
debate matters about which decisions have been taken. A decision had to be taken at some stage, and it was taken. It could have been presented as a parliamentary answer. I am sorry that Opposition Members fail to see the benefit of expressing their views here.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Something unusual is going on here. The Northern Ireland Grand Committee has not met as frequently as we would have liked, and now the debate has been pre-empted by the Minister's decision. It is also unfortunate that we are meeting today when Northern Ireland business is taking place on the Floor of the House. That will cause difficulties, because we cannot be in two places at the same time. The business on the Floor of the House is important to the nature of democracy and its functioning in Northern Ireland as a whole, whereas the issue that the Minister wants us to debate here is a narrow one. Will there be a Grand Committee every time the Minister wants to discuss matters of this weight? If so, I would be delighted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am also disappointed that no provision was made for questions at this sitting. As we do not have much of a hearing on the Floor of the House, could we not have questions at all such Committee sittings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before I call the Minister to speak, I should say that the right hon. Gentleman did not raise a point of order. It may be convenient for him if I say that I shall suspend the Committee for 15 minutes to enable hon. Members to take part in a Division if there is one. If I know that there will be a double Division—I have no means of knowing that, but the usual channels may be able to give me a nudge in the right direction—I shall suspend the Committee for 30 minutes. Unlike in Westminster Hall, there is no injury time here, so any suspensions will come out of the time for debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am at a loss to understand how the right hon. Gentleman could lay on my shoulders the suggestion that I knew the order of business in the Chamber today and its relation to Northern Ireland when we planned the Committee. That could not have been known. We planned the Committee some time ago, as I thought that he was aware. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] If I heard the right hon. Gentleman's comment from a sedentary position correctly, I suggest that he talks to the people who talk to us as we arrange Committees. Such matters are usually consulted about some time in advance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A request was made that the Committee meet not here but in Northern Ireland, so we could as easily have been discussing this or another issue in Northern Ireland today. That puts matters in stark relief, as we could not have known what the business on the Floor of the House would have been. All such matters must be dealt with through the normal courtesies that prevail between the Government and Opposition Whips.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I was a Whip, I regularly sought from the usual channels the dates and details of the order of business before the House. That is a reason why I recently asked on
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0648">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
the Floor of the House when we would meet. Even today, those who apparently object to our meeting in Northern Ireland cannot find time to meet us here. There must be more movement from the usual channels in consultation, because some of the business today is relevant to Northern Ireland. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) said, we have limited opportunities to ask questions in the House, as can be seen if one analyses the Order Paper.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's thorough comments. Obviously, such discussions must prevail between the usual channels if a way forward is to be found. The matter of why there are to be no questions is not for me, so I should not rule on it. I accept the importance of questions. We have never ducked the issue and will give full recognition to it. Before our proceedings began, someone asked why there was to be no Adjournment debate. I had no answer; people may not have applied for one. Perhaps questions should be asked about that as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Attendance or non-attendance is a matter for hon. Members. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman takes it up with those parties to which he alludes. Those who do not participate today may find themselves arguing against the presence of Grand Committees in Northern Ireland. I am sure that he can open up such lines of communication.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strangford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not hold the Minister responsible for the clash between our proceedings and the debate on the Floor of the House on the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill. That is an unfortunate coincidence, but it is not his fault. There should have been questions, however.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask for further clarification on your ruling, Mr. McWilliam. I support your decision to have a 15-minute suspension if there is a Division and a 30-minute suspension if there are two. However, the debate deals with matters of great interest in Northern Ireland and is in many respects more important than the Divisions. Could we not have a suspension for the entire period of the debate?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the right hon. Gentleman want to move a dilatory motion? If so, I am tempted in the circumstances to accept it, but my guidance to the Committee would be that we have the documents and an interesting parliamentary answer, which I have read. To answer the point about which Minister is responsible, the Leader of the House is always responsible for the business on the Floor of the House. On the question about the usual channels, I have not been involved in such matters for a very long time—since 1987—so I can take no responsibility for that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps we can now get down to the substance of what we are here to discuss. I welcome the opportunity to set out the detailed reasons behind my announcement today on the future of the juvenile justice estate in Northern Ireland. I reiterate that the normal practice would have been simply to release the
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
information by parliamentary answer, but in this case we can, through the process of debate, draw out the reasoning that led me to my conclusions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While the announcement deals with a new building, it is not essentially about bricks and mortar. It is about providing a more sensitive environment for young people who are among the most disadvantaged and socially deprived in our society. It is an area of work that deserves close attention. The work that has already gone on with those children in Northern Ireland must be applauded. It is a difficult, never-ending and thankless task, which is critical not only for the young people themselves but for the communities in which they live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will know the history of the treatment of juveniles who offend or who are at risk of offending and how that has changed in recent years. We used to have a system in which young people could be convicted of not very serious offences and yet spend a considerable period in a training school. That punitive approach was misplaced, damaging and ineffective. It was no way for a modern society to address the needs of young people who offend against it. A new approach was required and that is what we have progressively developed and delivered over a four-year period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Custody is now reserved for only the most serious and persistent offenders. In addition, the type of sentencing used for young people has been changed from a semi-determinate order to a determinate sentence, usually of shorter length, half of which is served in custody and the remainder under supervision in the community. That is designed to help to steer young people away from offending and to give them encouragement and support to achieve a normal adult life. I am pleased that those changes have had the desired effect. The number of young people in custody has reduced significantly and the length of time that they spend in custody has also reduced. However, because of the serious nature of the actions of juveniles who receive custodial sentences, it is important to provide secure conditions, for the protection of both the public and the juveniles themselves.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I refer my right hon. Friend to paragraph 21 on page 6 of the document "Statements of Standards and Criteria for Juvenile Justice Centres in Northern Ireland", which sets out sensible guidelines for assessing youngsters when they are first admitted. It states that a young person's initial physical needs will be assessed. I stress the need also to assess the mental well-being of such youngsters—for example, their propensity to inflict injuries on themselves. My question is prompted by the distressingly high incidence of suicide among young men in Scottish prisons, which reflects the growing number of suicides among young men in society at large.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to explain the range of issues that we have to take into account; I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning that important aspect of the assessment of these young people, many of whom are disturbed. They have not just committed crimes;
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0649">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
some of them are disturbed, for a wide variety of reasons, when they enter the custodial system. That is why I say that those who have carried out the work should be applauded. It is a never-ending and thankless task. I know that my hon. Friend does not fall into the category of people who do that, but the finger of blame is all too readily pointed at those carrying out that caring role in such institutions, in very difficult circumstances, if something goes wrong. A multi-agency approach is required, and that is what we have put in place. I shall highlight some of the issues that we have to address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out the background to our progressive movement over the past four years to a much more sensitive and compassionate approach. Because the nature of the work and the facilities have changed significantly in recent years, I ordered a review of the juvenile justice estate. Before expanding on that, I want first to set out my vision for the juvenile justice custodial system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the information that was made available, constant reference is made to provision for boys and young people. Can the Minister give us a breakdown of the numbers of males and females among those deemed juvenile young offenders? Will the proposed new provision make separate arrangements for the two groups, or will they be treated as one?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will write to all members of the Committee with a detailed breakdown. At present, there are about five girls in the system. That could change at any time. The judgment on provision is made on the basis of not only gender but the seriousness of the crime committed, which can vary between the genders. We have to take account of that mix in the new centre. I shall elaborate on our approach and why I have concluded that it is the best way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Custody is the most serious option open to the youth court and it should not be imposed lightly. It is now reserved for only the most serious and persistent offenders. Those young people are in great need and it is imperative that while they are in custody and under supervision they are given effective corrective support, including the psychiatric assessment and support to which my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Dr. Godman) referred. We need to work with such young people to help them to address the causes of their offending behaviour. That is done through the development of the innovative split custody and community sentence, which has the aim of ensuring that young people make the transition from custody effectively, with a minimal risk of relapse.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The focus of the system is the development of a child-centred approach. From the moment the young person enters the juvenile justice centre, work commences to ensure that on release he or she has the best opportunity to reintegrate into the community. That involves a multi-discipline assessment of the young person's needs. An individual programme is prepared based on that assessment, which seeks to stabilise what is often a chaotic life style and to address
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
the causes of offending behaviour and educational needs. Sadly, the young person may all too often not have participated in formal education for a number of years. Innovative programmes such as cognitive skills behaviour therapy have already been introduced and will be further developed to give young people the best opportunity to address the problems that they will face in custody and afterwards.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also essential to have in place good links between those responsible for custodial provision and those with responsibility for delivering services in the community. Links have been established with the education and social services, so that they can become involved in the planning process as soon as the young person enters the system. In that way, the community supervision element of the sentence will provide the young person with the support necessary to make the transition to the community. In that context, the role of the family assumes particular importance. Families have a responsibility to support the young person through that difficult period, but they usually need help and encouragement to meet the challenge.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that when the education service was ready to take over, it was told by the Northern Ireland Office to put the move on hold. What steps have been taken since to involve the education service in the education of those young people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not quite as the hon. Gentleman says. Those who deliver educational services under the remit of the Northern Ireland Office are paid by the Northern Ireland Office, not by the Education Department. I have had had a meeting with the Education Minister of the devolved Administration to find ways of ensuring proper educational resources for the new institution and the institutions put in place in advance of the new building being ready for use. That will require further discussion between the Departments. It is not one Department saying that it is not interested; the Departments are working together to ensure that we have strong educational resources in the centres. That what we seek to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessment process must begin early in the custodial element of the sentence, and it will necessarily require investment in arrangements that facilitate and strengthen family links and empower parents to play their part in addressing the factors associated with the young person's offending behaviour. Regrettably, the comfort of loving family support is not available to many of the young people who enter custody. A substantial number—about 30 per cent.—are committed to juvenile justice centres direct from the care system, often for the most minor of offences, which further marginalises that already disadvantaged group.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That unsatisfactory situation needs to be addressed with appropriate urgency by the devolved Administration. I am aware that the Health, Social Services and Public Safety Committee of the Assembly is undertaking an inquiry into residential care provisions for children in Northern Ireland, and that a task force has been established to deal with matters
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0650">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
arising from the inquiry. We in the Northern Ireland Office will do what we can to help, as it is important to avoid criminalising those young people and to divert them away from the juvenile justice system. However, a key element of today's debate is about the accommodation in which those services are provided.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The existing juvenile justice estate consists of two open juvenile justice centres and one closed site. The open centres need major enhancement to house the young people in the system, and the closed site, although it provides secure accommodation, is built to a prison design and is not considered appropriate for juveniles. The three sites have capacity for a total of 115 juveniles. The present population is about 30, and it is estimated that provision should be made for a total of 50. From the outset, there was a mismatch, with many more places available than would be required. More important, however, is the fact that what is in place now is not suitable to meet future needs. Before deciding on the way forward, I wanted to hear the views of others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In April 2000, I launched a consultation document on the future size and location of the juvenile justice estate. It focused entirely on accommodation. It set out the issues that needed to be considered, and sought views. I thank those who took the time and trouble to respond. It was extremely important that I should hear the views of a wide range of interested parties to help me to formulate my conclusions. We received 28 responses to the consultation document. The 24 people who expressed a firm opinion were divided almost equally between wanting one or two centres, and only one argued for a multiple site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arguments offered in favour of two centres were that the numbers would be more manageable; that it would be more child-centred, by providing community-based facilities that were less institutionalised; and that it would better meet human rights requirements by providing greater flexibility and an element of choice. The vital question of how young people would be allocated in two centres was either ignored or not answered in detail. The advocates of a single centre advanced a series of benefits, including the capacity to develop more effective regimes; better use of resources in providing a range of services to a critical mass of young people; and the release of more resources for the provision of community-based services. As ever, it was not a unanimous view upon which I could base my decision or move forward without criticism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The accommodation in the juvenile justice system has to meet a number of needs. First, it is essential to provide a safe and secure environment. Custody is reserved for the most serious and persistent offenders, so it is imperative that security is such as to contain those young people for their own safety and for the protection of the public, but it is also important that the security should not be oppressive. For example, our experience is that the use offences merely presents
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
a challenge for young people, and that is counterproductive. We need to maintain security and control without being forbidding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the population may be small, the permutations of needs are endless. I had to give close consideration to the diverse needs of the different groups of juveniles who come into custody. We need to cater for males and females. Those on remand have different needs from those who have been sentenced. Vulnerable juveniles and those who represent a significant challenge to authority have differing needs. Those with basic educational needs and those for whom participation in formal examinations is a real option must be taken into account. Training opportunities should be available to the older age group. The religious needs of juveniles are equally important and cannot be ignored. Accommodation units must be small in order to reduce the opportunity for control problems. Most of all, the accommodation needs to be child-friendly and unthreatening.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those were the multi-faceted aspects that I had to take into consideration. They seemed to point towards the provision of small, independent units that would cater for the specific needs of their young residents. Unfortunately, such a provision would make it difficult to meet changing needs or to provide a progressive system without disruptive transfers between sites. It would also lack flexibility and could result in the isolation of young people. Experience also shows that it is important to have a critical mass of people so as to ensure the effective provision of opportunities such as education and recreation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concluded that, for an estimated maximum population of 50 juveniles—in reality, the population would be less than that—the most appropriate option would be a single site that offered comprehensive educational and recreational provisions but that housed the population in small living units. A modern construction would allow the best design features to be included, delivering intrinsic security in a safe and relatively welcoming environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
None of the existing facilities meets those criteria. Lisnevin provides the necessary security, but it suffers from a prison-style environment. Rathgael and St. Patrick's both provide relatively modern and bright living accommodation, but both are open and the necessary level of security could be delivered only through the provision of substantial fencing. In addition, they would provide a campus-type environment that would be difficult to control, which would make it difficult to deliver the full potential of the sites. The buildings are not reflective of modern design in the provision of secure facilities for juveniles.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Both of the existing open facilities could be developed to provide improved security and an opportunity for a progressive and differential regime. However, they would remain open facilities that have been made secure and would not represent the best opportunity to meet the needs of the population.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I concluded that the best option is to make provision for a purpose-built modern facility on a single site. I gave consideration to a greenfield site in a neutral location that has no ties with the past, but concluded
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0651">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
that the difficulty in locating a suitable site would be prohibitive, and it would have attracted additional costs. I considered using the Prison Service site at Hydebank Wood but, although that site has advantages associated with its location, a site so closely associated with the Prison Service is not suitable for the long-term provision of facilities for juveniles. It could create a continuum mentality when we are seeking to break that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Similarly, I considered a new build at the Lisnevin site, but that is both the least attractive option in terms of location and a Prison Service site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I considered the site currently owned by the voluntary sector at St. Patrick's in west Belfast. While that is in a central location, the area is closely associated with one section of the community, and the perception—I stress that it is a perception—is that it would not be fully accessible by the Protestant community. In addition, the voluntary sector in Northern Ireland is precluded by law from the provision of secure care. In those circumstances it is more appropriate to have secure custody also delivered within the statutory sector. The St. Patrick's site is therefore not in my view the best option for the new centre. However, I am currently funding the delivery of community-based diversionary projects at St. Patrick's and I intend to continue to do so and to discuss with management how those might be further developed to meet the needs of local young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to community-based diversionary projects. What is that code for? Could he explain in a wee bit more detail precisely what is going on there?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is not code for anything. It is what I say it is. It involves efforts in a multi-agency or sometimes a single-agency approach to discourage young people from criminality. If the hon. Gentleman is suspicious about what happens in these communities he may wish to visit St. Patrick's or the other projects that are in place throughout Northern Ireland and look at the multi-agency way in which this has been tackled. It has been extremely successful. He should speak to the parents and the young people who are engaged in the process. I suspect that he thinks that this is a form of restorative justice, but it is not: it is diversionary. It is not after the event but in advance of it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Parents and others within the community may be concerned about young people who are close to criminality. Such young people are given opportunities to meet in surroundings where they can talk through some of their problems. Educational approaches are often adopted. They are encouraged to follow their specific talents, such as in art, sport or whatever. Group pressures and the support of their parents and the agencies helps to channel them in that direction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On exactly the same question, the Minister proposes that St. Patrick's and Lisnevin be closed and he has explained how he is pursuing
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
alternative uses and activities at St. Patrick's. Is he equally keen to provide alternative uses at Lisnevin? If so, what will they be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that that sits within the ambit of what I am talking about, mainly because Lisnevin is remote. The right hon. Gentleman has a quizzical look. If he thinks that people do not see it as remote, I am surprised, given that he comes from Northern Ireland and I do not. He obviously is not hearing what people say about Lisnevin. It is also a Prison Service site. We are seeking to base the type of activities that I described within the community. Undoubtedly, there is a community around Lisnevin, but those in the facility would not necessarily come from there. Our innovative projects at St. Patrick's and the centres in Newtownards, Derry and other parts of Northern Ireland are close to the community. Parents can travel there easily and the young people have easy access. Lisnevin would not satisfy those criteria and so would not have been considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lisnevin happens to be in my constituency, which has the most rapidly increasing population in Northern Ireland. It is outrageous for the Minister to dismiss it as remote. He has shown great concern about the efficient use of resources and is concerned about the naughty people who will be in these premises, but what about the people who work there? What will he do about the 94 staff at Lisnevin?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not dismiss Lisnevin as remote. I said that that is what people say to me about it. It is one of the arguments that is advanced. I am surprised if the right hon. Gentleman does not hear those arguments. If it is a growing area and if juvenile criminality begins to manifest itself, we may need initiatives there, although not necessarily on the Lisnevin site. It is better to be near shopping centres, schools and community facilities and thus to offer easy access. That is not the case at the Lisnevin site. It is also a Prison Service site and it falls to the service to consider its development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the future of the staff, our judgment is that none of the staff in the care sector will be made redundant. Clearly it will not be convenient for some of the ancillary support people to travel to a new site. That has to be a matter of regret. There will be a contraction in this area and some people will have to be made redundant. This is about delivering services to young people, not to people who work in centres. The first, second and last concern is what is right for the young people. The interests of the staff clearly have to be dealt with sensitively, but that should not be the overriding consideration when it comes to the future of young people in care. Our assessment is that the staff in the care sector will be needed in the new system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have set out my conclusions about Lisnevin and St. Patrick's. I then had to consider Rathgael in Bangor. The site has some shortcomings—it will not be perceived by all as an entirely neutral location—but it has successfully catered for the needs of young people from both sides of the community for some years, even with those realities and perceptions. I have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0652">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
decided therefore that the future provision for custody of juveniles should be a purpose-built facility at Rathgael in Bangor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important element of the ethics of juvenile custodial provision is the maintenance of links with families. Every effort must be made to ensure that family links can be maintained and matured while the young person is in custody. That implies that innovative and progressive visiting arrangements must be provided. To that end, purpose-built accommodation will be provided on site to facilitate overnight and weekend visits by family members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the proposal to provide accommodation for families to stay, not just overnight, but perhaps at weekends. Will my right hon. Friend confirm that families on social security can obtain financial assistance for travelling costs if they travel a greater distance? I think that they can obtain that assistance from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that that is correct, but I would go further and consider people on low incomes or who, for whatever reason, find it difficult to travel regularly. We must be sensitive to the fact that, although accommodation may be available, people may not find it easy to travel. We must consider ways in which we can encourage families to be on site for the weekend or a couple of days mid-week, because it is important that they engage with their young people, who will ultimately lead normal lives in the community. That is our aim. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] The right hon. Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor) is muttering. I do not know whether he wants me to give way.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was thinking that a weekend in Millisle would be nice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree, and that is one reason why I considered Lisnevin. I have not gone into the detail of all our considerations, but I did say that Lisnevin would have been an attractive place for the centre, because it is a particularly nice part of the country. I am sure that that would have provided an inducement for families to spend the weekends there, but for lack of other reasons, we decided not to proceed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many units of accommodation for parents are planned?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That has not been decided. We have arrived at a conclusion about the site of the centre and must now consider how the facility is constructed and what we can afford to have on site. We have not yet reached the financial planning stage for those aspects. I am simply giving a flavour of what I believe is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The centre at Lisnevin is interesting, because people with the difficulties that have been raised are put up in local bed-and-breakfast accommodation. That has been successful. If the family relationship approach proved productive for the reasons that I have outlined
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
and there was insufficient accommodation on site, I would have to consider alternatives such as local bed-and-breakfast or hotel accommodation. It is not a question of largesse. Many of the parents come from troubled backgrounds and may not have the financial wherewithal to travel to the site or stay close at hand to support their young people. We should do our best to facilitate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In line with section 25 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which places a requirement on Government to promote equality of opportunity and good relations, I arranged for an independent consultant to carry out an impact assessment on the decision that I have announced. The consultant concluded that, although there would be an adverse impact on some groups, it was not likely to be significant. The assessment is in the public domain on the NIO website, and copies are available from the juvenile justice branch of my Department.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important decision, which will shape the future of juvenile justice custodial provision in Northern Ireland. It was important that the views of others were sought and fully considered, and I did just that. It was also important to take account of the wide range of factors that have an impact on, and shape the lives of, young people. I recognise that the decision will not necessarily be welcomed by everyone, but it is the most appropriate one at a time when we are moving from open conditions to the need for greater security.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to all those who have worked in the system for their long years of dedication and hard work in difficult circumstances. We all owe them a debt of gratitude.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The decision builds on important changes in custody for young people. It gives the system a clear focus for the future and allows the people in the system to plan ahead with some certainty. It will also permit attention and resources to be turned to the development of diversionary work with young people in the community. We have already come a long way: many young people have already been supported in community-based projects. I mentioned the community-based work undertaken by some staff at St. Patrick's and my intention to consider how that might be further developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other examples of diversionary work exist. The Whitefield partnerships involve social services, education and library boards, and probation. Funding has recently been provided to similar partnerships operating in Derry, some of which will target in particular the needs of children in care. Those partnerships are designed to address the wide-ranging needs of young people and to divert them from the juvenile justice system. By freeing more resources, we could do so much more to meet their needs and make all our communities safer places in which to live. That lies at the heart of the decision, and I commend it to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In an important sense, I defer to the Northern Ireland Members present. After all, they are returned by the electors in

Northern Ireland and have more of a feel for the matters under discussion than I could ever have. The problems to which the Government seek to respond are problems in their constituencies and communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that social factors are involved, but the matters before us are largely logistical and managerial, relating to the best use of the relevant estate. I make no apology for having no expertise in those areas and I certainly would not presume any expertise in a Northern Ireland setting.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That said, I shall comment briefly on behalf of the official Opposition. We note that the number of young offenders held in Irish juvenile justice centres has steadily declined since 1996. The consultation paper wants consideration of reforming the existing centres and streamlining present provision, so that there is either a single residential centre for Northern Ireland or just two, rather than the four schools already in use. The Minister's remarks have taken that further forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Naturally, the Conservative party supports effective remedies that tackle youth offending. The public must be protected, offenders must be rehabilitated and victims must be given reparation. It is sad that 26 per cent. of youth crime is committed by a mere 3 per cent. of young offenders. Young persistent menaces need to be dealt with decisively. They need to be in a regime that provides protection for the community while providing measures to secure a change in the young offenders. We must ensure that release is linked to personal achievement and reform.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I doubt whether there is much difference between my party and the Government on the matter. I will permit myself one philosophical objection: the balance between rehabilitation of the young person and the protection of the rest of the community should possibly be weighted slightly in favour of protecting the rest of the community. Broadly, however, it is a matter of balance. The Minister presented his case coherently, and there was a theme to his proposal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end as I began, by saying that I am reluctant to make presumptions on Northern Ireland matters beyond giving the Conservative party's general position on juvenile criminal justice. I am especially interested to hear what Northern Ireland Members have to say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister does not believe that I have ever made a brief speech, but I will today. I agree with everything that he said about the extremely difficult work for the staff. My brother-in-law, Martin, worked in a Catholic list D school in the east end of Glasgow for many years. I do not know how he managed to turn up for work every week, to deal with disturbed young males, some of them so street smart that they were much smarter than him, an ex-naval rating. Some of those young people, who were in the age range that we are now considering, 10 to 17, were vicious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
I know, as does my right hon. Friend, how difficult it is to look after such youngsters, many of whom are disturbed and have suffered abuse in their families. I am sure that the staff have excellent trade union representation. Nevertheless, I hope, with reference to redundancies, that a good settlement deal is provided for the people concerned, who have given many years of hard and often distressing work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The children go through the juvenile courts system. I do not want to run into trouble with you, Mr. McWilliam, but I wonder if any thought has ever been given to the possibility of adopting our children's panel system for youngsters in the relevant age range and of providing additional protection, by way of closed circuit television, for the more disturbed youngsters when they are cross-examined. I do not know how far that idea has been developed in the Northern Ireland court system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend has presented us with an excellent document, but I have one or two questions. A representation procedure is described at paragraph 15 on page 5. Even before I read that, the first question that occurred to me was whether a grievance procedure was available for the youngsters, who might have legitimate concerns about a member of staff. I see that the procedure allows young people to make complaints about their treatment. I take it that on making such a complaint to the supervisor of the person who is being complained about, the youngster will have representation, although it might not be legal representation, at every stage of the procedure. How far does the procedure go? Does it end with the head of the centre?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased to note from paragraph 19 on the same page that there are
	<br><blockquote><p>specific policies and practices for keeping young people safe from self harm.</p></blockquote>
My interest is linked to my earlier question about the initial assessment that is made of the youngsters. In addition to assessment of physical condition and needs, there should be psychiatric assessment when, for example, a youngster has a history of inflicting harm on himself or herself. I have mentioned the distressingly high incidence of suicide among young men in prisons in Scotland in the past three or four years. In the prison in my constituency, two young men committed suicide within 24 hours of each other. The suicide rate in Scottish prisons fairly accurately reflects the dreadful trend among young men in Scottish society as a whole. I was gratified by my right hon. Friend's assurance that such concerns will at all times be taken into account during the initial assessment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased with the wording of paragraph 19, because, as my right hon. Friend said, some of the youngsters concerned have suffered terrible abuse and are psychologically disturbed. It is important to protect them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I am going to have to rule an hon. Member out of order in a moment. I really do not want to do that, because my own instincts tell me that it is wrong. However, the Whip really must desist from

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another of my worries, to which my right hon. Friend has, as promised, responded, concerned giving assistance to youngsters' families for travel to and from the centre or for overnight or weekend stays with their children. I know that assistance is given with travel costs to people travelling to and from prison, if they are on income support or other welfare payments. However, I thought it right to voice those concerns in response to his statement on the development of the centre.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.56 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's arguments. If we were dealing simply with financial aspects of the matter, the estate of Rathgael might be considered one of the finest pieces of estate that could go on the market. It is a fine campus. I pay tribute to those who have been involved in the care of young people that has gone on since the days of Balmoral and Whiteabbey and through the developments at Rathgael. I visited it many years ago and met many people who worked there. I understand that the work at St. Patrick's has gone on likewise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been talk about some of the problems of Roman Catholics and Protestants in some areas. However, I think that the Minister would agree that, while traditionally Rathgael was a state sector institution, looking after Protestants, and St. Patrick's and St. Joseph's were voluntary Roman Catholic institutions, looking after Roman Catholic young people, those places have recently had mixed clienteles. One of the greatest needs has been for secure accommodation for younger girls. That need arises within the context of a problem affecting the whole of Northern Ireland social services, about which I have asked questions in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand why the Minister decided in the end against Hydebank, although I am not completely convinced that that was the right decision. In the documentation that has been given to us it is suggested that Hydebank is very close to a Protestant community, but the community throughout that area, including the estate further up, is mixed. The Minister and his departmental colleagues may know about the letter that I received from a constituent from the Beech Hill road area, who, having been a teacher at St. Patrick's, wants to probe some decisions that were made about St. Patrick's and Rathgael, and to establish who was responsible. We have found it difficult to obtain answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked about education earlier, and the Minister said that I had got it wrong. Although some people joke that because I am a Presbyterian minister I speak for a long time, others say that I can be concise and terse. Perhaps I was being concise and terse, because the Minister wondered who had given me that impression.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Custodial sentences are a maximum of two years but are on average less than six months. It is extremely difficult to help young people in such circumstances, as they return to a community in which the same background impinges on them. In assessing the problem, and in reducing the numbers that might in future require such accommodation, has the Department considered the impact on our communities of an evolving peace without summary jurisdictions through which young lads have their knees improved through kneecapping exercises or other forms of summary punishment? Might that be one reason why the same number of young people are not being given custodial sentences?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tragically, Rathgael does not have a good record of enticing people to stay. It has a pretty good record for absconding. The Minister said that young folk have not found fences difficult. That is one reason why I wonder whether the secure accommodation at Hydebank might not have been better, with special accommodation built into the property for such young offenders, especially as Hydebank is but a beagle's jowl from Knockbracken and some of the finest psychiatric provision in the country.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In using our resources economically and purposefully, I understand that we do not want young folk to be too close to justice systems, but we must face the fact that they are subject to a justice system, and that that is why they are there. A combined educational service for both the custodial section and the junior section might be a better use of facilities and staff. As the Minister will confirm, those who have worked for years in Hydebank have an enviable reputation for advanced activities in looking after young people, as has been recognised by successive awards from the trust here in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In dealing with the overall problem, how far are we working alongside social services? I know from my remit over the years that there is a tremendous shortage of secure accommodation, especially for young girls and, in some cases, for young men who have been in care and have been abused. We must consider that aspect. The other aspect involved is cost. I have no difficulty with accommodation for parents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hydebank is possibly more accessible than any of the others. Arrangements could be made such that the special unit could be approached from a different entrance to the young offenders centre. In terms of cost, there is a difference of about £2 million between what might be required to upgrade Rathgael and what is needed for Hydebank. I think that that is right—perhaps the Minister could confirm the figures. Those of us who know anything about public expenditure know that by the time the job is done, the figure will have increased dramatically. I would have thought that building site and land purchase, for example, would be much easier around Hydebank than in Bangor.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the decision to move forward, but I am concerned about those who have been left in the dark. One of my constituents, when things began to move, approached the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney), who handles Rathgael, and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0655">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
the elected but non-attending person from West Belfast, Mr. Gerry Adams. There was a response from the hon. and learned Gentleman but no response from Mr. Adams, so my constituent came to me. He wanted to find out what was going on. There is concern. The Minister will agree—he has already suggested it himself—that there will be disagreements as to siting. There is no disagreement about asking for improved provision for young people. I do so not because I am the hon. Member for Belfast, South but because I still believe that Hydebank will provide the best provision at the most economical rate, and it is approachable from the west, north and south of the Province.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.7 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My constituency has been rather fortunate in terms of crime rates, especially among young people. However, on one occasion, I gave a speech about how we must be more understanding about juvenile crime. What I did not realise was that, even as I spoke, one of the young listeners was stealing my mobile phone. I have been more cautious since then.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we have already heard, the effect of the three orders has been to reduce dramatically the number of children being held in custody in Northern Ireland. That is an extremely welcome development. Liberal Democrats firmly believe that the instances in which children should be detained should be minimised, because detention does not necessarily turn out to be the most effective means of preventing reoffending in the long term. To that end, I found the Northern Ireland Office's "Statements of Standards and Criteria for Juvenile Justice Centres in Northern Ireland" an extremely useful document, although it has rather a long-winded title.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister reassure the Committee that the standards in that document are fully upheld in the current centres and, crucially, will be taken into full consideration as the new regime is introduced? Can he also give an account of the success of those measures? What is the rate of reoffending among the young people who passed through the centres since the orders were introduced, between 1995 and 1998? I realise that he may not have the answer today, but I would be grateful if he could send a written response to me and, if it is appropriate in his judgment, to the rest of the Committee as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is patently clear that the Government are right to deal with future provision, and to that end, it is right to have only one centre instead of the number that we currently have. While two centres would allow some flexibility in terms of accessibility, and possibly in terms of acceptability to the divided community, there would be organisational difficulties in deciding who should be placed where. My great fear is that children would be placed in particular centres according to religious background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 4.55 of the review states:
	<br><blockquote><p>In practice a likely outcome, of a 2 centre option would be to return to the allocation of young people primarily on the basis of their religious background.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
The Minister, by implication, is also concerned about that, which is a powerful reason to have an integrated one-centre environment. Indeed, since the 1998 legislation placements have not had regard to the denomination of the young person concerned. Both Rathgael and St. Patrick's accommodate Catholics and Protestants.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's policy of making best use of existing buildings and infrastructure within establishments is the appropriate way forward. I would oppose an entirely new centre built on a greenfield site. The current centres have been in existence for some time—St. Patrick's and Lisnevin are not especially close to areas of housing—and if it were decided that the new centre should be at Rathgael, a secure perimeter fence would solve the absconding problem. However, I fully accept that a perimeter fence would create other difficulties. The Minister may want to consider that in more detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Depending on where an entirely new centre was built, concerns would be raised by nearby residents. That is not sufficient reason not to build a new centre, but the delay of a planning inquiry and the fact that the building stock on existing sites could be improved—admittedly at some cost—are compelling reasons for using one of the existing sites. I would also oppose a single unit at Hydebank. It is not appropriate for young children to be so physically close to the young offenders centre, as some of the offenders held there will be as old as 23. Also, the type of accommodation on offer would be entirely inappropriate for children, as it would remain in the style of a prison. A prison-like environment might risk reinforcing a crime paradigm in the minds of children.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman spell out how he would expect a secure environment not to have such an impact on those children? Most of them will have lived in terraced houses, where they are used to opening the door on to the street.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right that custodial sentences will necessarily be problematic, as they can reinforce a school for crime culture if not handled appropriately. In strategic terms, the answer to his question is that we must balance the need for secure accommodation with the sense, internally, that it does not feel like a prison. Those inside should only realise that it is secure when they try to break out. A precedent exists for that, especially in accommodation for young people with behavioural difficulties on the mainland of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have not, as a society, fully understood this matter. We have not pressed the right buttons in terms of modifying a young person's criminal behaviour. Although I can give a strategic answer, the details are not yet fully understood. If I could answer the hon. Gentleman's question in more detail than that, I probably would not be a Member of Parliament; I would be becoming rich and famous for designing such secure accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the upside, recent psychological studies will help us understand the thinking of young offenders. Important organisations such as Fairbridge and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0656">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Youth At Risk have studied that question. Will the Minister confirm that, as the new arrangements are introduced, he will consult voluntary sector organisations as well as those on the mainland that already receive Government funding? Those organisations have tried to deal with such issues and, to some extent, have been more successful. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question because it is important to put those points on the record.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My preferred option would be to retain one of the existing units and ensure that it provides the full range of accommodation to all children served with custodial orders. I am in favour of all children being educated and spending recreational time together, although that would require careful supervisory arrangements. However, there are precedents for that, and it can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the style of accommodation available in Lisnevin because, even if it were refurbished, it would remain in a similar condition to Hydebank. It is difficult to imagine creating the environment that I have described, especially as Hydebank was designed as a category C prison. It may not be impossible, but if that site were to be used, we would need clear assurances on how the facility would be updated. What must guide us in that decision is the degree to which we can ensure that the accommodation is modern and able to provide the best means to prevent the children from reoffending.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rathgael has the capacity for the 40 places that the Government have said would be needed. The report states that four out of five of its house units have been recently refurbished to a high standard and that it has good recreational facilities. The close proximity of Rathgael and its change from an open to a secure unit may worry those living in the surrounding area, which has recently been substantially developed for private housing. Will the Minister undertake to consult nearby residents to obtain their views about the change in nature of the facility, if he is giving serious consideration to placing the unit there? Wherever the facility is sited, the local community should be involved, otherwise an antagonism might develop that would be wholly destructive to what we are trying to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The facilities at St. Patrick's are apparently in excellent condition. It does not have the capacity for the extra 40 places, but at least one can be sure that it is of the right style and character and could be updated. The staff must be considered, too, and the question of redundancy should be treated sensitively. Will the Minister give an assurance that he will consult the current staff and take their views into consideration? After all, the staff are the experts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should remember that none of those centres represents a cure for crime. If a young person ends up with a custodial sentence, something has gone wrong. We should be sensitive to the fact that, although the reduction from an average 119 places to 35 or 40 shows that we have taken a huge step forward, the problem of eliminating criminal tendencies and curing crime
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
has not been resolved. The welfare of the younger generation must be considered. To refer to a comment made by the right hon. Member for Upper Bann in another debate, the fact that those children have a past does not mean that they cannot have a future. We should remember that the purpose of those centres is not to punish young people but to get them back on to the right track. As the youth affairs spokesperson, it is my experience that those who get into the greatest trouble are often the most creative who end up giving the most back to society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that something has already gone seriously wrong by the time a young person is placed in a custodial environment, which is a statement that I support. Is the source of the problem not actually a crisis of parenthood? That is not a terribly original thought, but it is one that we should not lose sight of.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman is right, of course, but this may not be the time to debate that point in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have made my contribution extensive and detailed because, for all our debates on Northern Ireland on many subjects, the greatest single challenge for society at this time is to find a way in which to reintegrate the increasing number of young offenders who fall by the wayside. In respect of Northern Ireland, we have the capacity to consider parenthood and other factors such as custodial sentences and relevant facilities. As with human rights legislation, perhaps Northern Ireland can be the model to instruct those who do the same work elsewhere in the United Kingdom and, indeed, the British Isles.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.20 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cecil Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I listened attentively to my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) and I hope that the Minister's decision to build a new, single centre at Rathgael will address the concerns of those involved in the juvenile justice system. We know that the best resources and facilities are needed to curb persistent offenders. An ever-increasing spiral of juvenile crime is rampant throughout Northern Ireland and causing great consternation in the communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde mentioned the documents that we have received from the Northern Ireland Office—the blue one, entitled "Statements of Standards and Criteria for Juvenile Justice Centres in Northern Ireland", and the cream one, entitled "Future of the Juvenile Justice Centre Estate". With your permission, Mr. McWilliam, I should like to comment on and ask questions about those documents.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde expressed a concern about paragraph 21 of the blue document which I share, particularly in respect of the health needs of incumbents. Young people frequently refuse to take prescribed medication or attend medical appointments. In the light of paragraph 21, how will such problems be overcome?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0657">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
Page 3 paragraph 8 deals with staff objectives. It is essential that appropriate support and in-service training be given to staff where assessment so indicates. Paragraph 10 deals with staff meetings. It is important that such meetings be minuted, so that their conclusions can be acted on. Page 4 paragraph 2 deals with unacceptable conduct. I am concerned about the available sanctions. I should hate to think that sanctions will be imposed on those inmates who participate in character-building activities, given that such activities can have a great effect in later life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should elaborate on page 5 paragraph 12. It refers to published systems of rules, incentives and sanctions, but I am not aware of such a publication. Although that paragraph is very important, its description of the action to be taken is rather vague.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Standard 5, on page 6, deals with the standard of education. We all recognise that education provision is poor due to a lack of resources and that it will have to be improved. However, in paragraph 3 the use of the phrase
	<br><blockquote><p>in so far as is practicable</p></blockquote>
implies the potential for a cop-out in some circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of page 7 paragraph 8, I think it important that staff be competent to deal with young people with behavioural difficulties. In the past, there have been problems relating to staff in the institutions. There have even been allegations of physical abuse between staff and inmates, and I believe that such incidents are being investigated at the moment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One matter that was never mentioned, but which I am curious about, concerns the clothing allowance and weekly pocket money. I am not sure of the exact amounts that are involved in clothing allowances and pocket money, but I understand that they are generous. I am worried about giving those allowances when we can afford to keep offenders inside for a maximum of only three months before letting them out again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman accept that sometimes offenders have difficult home circumstances and that the clothing allowance could be regarded as a way of getting them back on their feet?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Walker</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I take the hon. Gentleman's point. However, some people in my constituency are in very poor circumstances and have great difficulty affording clothing. I would hate to think that people who uphold the law may look at those who come out of these establishments and think, "God Almighty, look what he got in there—maybe I should go in as well."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Paragraph 3.10 of the document states:
	<br><blockquote><p>As well as introducing new elements within the regime to confront offending behaviour, custodial units will need to provide a wide range of good education, vocational training and recreational facilities.</p></blockquote>
What is that wide range? It would have to be suitable for both genders of young people with a wide range of age and ability, many of whom have severe behavioural difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I am worried about the proposed level of night staffing that is stipulated in paragraph 5.4 of the document, especially in relation to secure accommodation in which young people are locked up. Health and safety factors are involved. What happens if there is a fire? What about suicide attempts? There should be sufficient staff not only to get by, but to deal with problems that may occur with disturbed young people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>6.27 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a useful debate, in which hon. Members have raised issues beyond the narrow focus of accommodation. As I said at the beginning, we are not only considering bricks and mortar—the prime issue is the young people themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concern was expressed about the frequency of Northern Ireland Grand Committees. There is a commitment to two sittings per Session dealing with oral questions, which have already taken place, and four sittings per Session in all. This is the fourth sitting. It could have taken place tomorrow—or on Friday if the House sits then—but in any case the commitment has been met. I hope that the right hon. Member for Upper Bann recognises that we have complied with the agreements that were made through the usual channels.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Members of the Committee will appreciate the Minister's clarification. The arrangements for sittings of the Committee also provide for it to meet in Northern Ireland. As yet, that has not happened. I hope that the next sitting will be there, and that you will join us, Mr. McWilliam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a matter for the usual channels. The hon. Gentleman and I have been in Northern Ireland within the past fortnight. I am always happy to attend this Committee, wherever it is held, and hear about Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should be pleased to take the Committee to Northern Ireland under your chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam. However, we need to agree to locate it there, and Committee members have not reached such an agreement, which is why it has not happened. I am not averse to it, because it could be beneficial. It would bring discussion of important issues closer to the people of Northern Ireland, and could be seen as another aspect of devolution. We must find a way forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister speaks about agreement, but a quota of Committee members is all that is required. The Standing Order does not specify that a certain number of political parties must be present.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a point of order, really. As far as the Chair is concerned, there must be 10 members present, and that can include me as a member of the Committee. I must therefore see nine members, and it does not matter which political parties they are from or what combination of parties they represent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0658">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have made my view clear, so perhaps we can resolve the matter in the next session through the usual channels.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the comments of the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor). He is right, in one sense, that the Government and the Opposition are close on this issue. However, I am not sure that I agree with him about where the balance lies. His party favours shifting the balance towards security for the rest of the community. I want to make it clear that we are proposing a very secure unit that will be designed to maximise security. The people held there may have carried out serious offences, so they need to be placed in a secure facility. They need to be there for their own protection, because they may abscond, and also for the protection of the rest of the community. We therefore agree with the Opposition on the need for secure facilities, which is exactly what we aim to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: One welcome point concerning the establishment of the secure unit is contained in the document entitled "Future of the Juvenile Justice Centre Estate". Paragraph 6.7 raises the issue that there is currently no secure unit for girls. When cases arise that cannot be managed in more open units, girls who are more than 15 years old are likely to be referred to the young offenders centre at Maghaberry. That caused the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs particular concern when it investigated Northern Ireland's prison system. The report states:
	<br><blockquote><p>All options envisage rectifying this situation.</p></blockquote>
That is a welcome development, as was what my right hon. Friend said on the matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that point. One approach to this issue arose from consideration of the views expressed by the Select Committee. However, we are mindful of the reality of the situation. That facilities for young girls have hitherto been inadequate is a matter of serious concern. It will be some time before we can provide the new facility, so we must continue to use other facilities that are not ideal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We want to ensure that small, discrete units are placed within a greater complex, so that we can locate facilities for young girls within it. However, one of those young people might prove disruptive, and could upset the rehabilitation of others in the unit. We shall have to deal with such realities all the time. Northern Ireland is usually different because the community that we are discussing is small and we must use other facilities to deal with a disruptive young person who may be affecting the well-being and development of other young people in the institution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a massive difficulty, and we are talking about one person. What arrangements will be made if that person is disruptive? She cannot be placed in isolation, so the problem must be overcome.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The flexibility in the new structure will provide another range of options in the future, but at the moment we do not have that. I cannot stand here and give answers to every eventuality, as my hon.
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
Friend understands, but we are trying to find a way of dealing with the problem. The problem involves not just the cost implications, which should not be a consideration. The solution may be incredibly staff intensive because a one-to-one relationship may have to be developed throughout the shift pattern. The new centre will have a facility to deal with the most disruptive young people in the system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McWalter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to put on the record that the word "disruptive" may be insufficient to describe someone who threatens the life of everyone with whom she comes into contact. If the ratio is three warders to one individual, normal mixing would be difficult. I agree with my right hon. Friend that it is appropriate that a young person of that character should be kept in a place that is dedicated to young people and not in an establishment for adults.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is our overriding objective. The word "disruptive" has many connotations and sometimes falls far short of the reality of handling a young person.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde referred to the Scottish experience and the way in which such issues are dealt with in Scotland. The comprehensive study of the juvenile justice system in Northern Ireland is coming to a conclusion. The review covered the way in which 17-year-olds should be treated in the system. I am sure that my hon. Friend has read that. As we move towards policy development and the framing of the legislation, I am sure that there will be discussions and that his experience will be taken into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend also asked what would happen if children complain and what representation process is in place. An independent representation scheme is run by the voluntary sector which helps young people to voice their concerns or complaints. In addition, a comprehensive child protection procedure, which is currently under review, provides for the involvement of social services and the police. That is evolving to ensure that young people have maximum protection for their rights in law and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South asked about security of the accommodation, and I referred to that earlier. Those who want to know what is in my mind should visit St. Mary's in the north of Glasgow, which is a state-of-the-art facility. There are similar facilities elsewhere in England, but I visited St. Mary's. It does not look like a prison. It is a modern building with an integral security system. It has no fences around it, which softens the exterior, but it is very secure. The staff are enthusiastic about the way in which they work with the young people. Some of those young people have committed very serious crimes. They work in small, discrete units but with shared educational and recreational facilities. That requires much supervision and is not simple or straightforward. There tends to be a high ratio of staff to young people in those units because of the intensity of the young people with whom they have to deal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0659">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
Perhaps I should not speak for St. Mary's and encourage a lot of people to go there and visit, but I would recommend the experience. In coming to my conclusions about the matter, I looked at a range of options, and my mind was not made up until I had seen the best institution of its kind anywhere in the United Kingdom. Visiting St. Mary's was a real eye-opener and I encourage others to go there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South also raised the issue of the shortfall in care accommodation in Northern Ireland. Such a shortfall undoubtedly exists. I referred to it in my opening statement about the work that has been done in the Assembly. The Assembly should move quickly on the issue, because tragically there are young people who have been placed in secure care by the court system who should really be in a care facility. Those young people should not be in the juvenile justice system at all. They are there because of the shortfall in care accommodation. We are working with social services staff on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The community-based activities of the Whitefield project and other projects being developed at St. Patrick's in west Belfast, in Londonderry and elsewhere in Northern Ireland will work on a multi-agency basis. Each agency has to depend on the others in terms of the assessment of the young people and in putting in place programmes to move them back into a normal life in the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that point, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker) shares my concern. St. Patrick's is a voluntary sector facility, as, I suspect, are the facilities in Londonderry. What is being done in north Belfast to care for the young people who have been in the custodial system? As far as we are aware there is no voluntary sector provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Whitefield project would be the most appropriate scheme, and I am sure that it includes a scheme for north Belfast. From the ether comes confirmation that that is the case. I know that the hon. Gentleman recognises that we cannot have such projects in every corner of Northern Ireland. We must try to discover the patterns of where young people are offending, and then put outreach facilities there so that they and their families can access them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A benefit of our handling of the matter is that it will release resources that can be put back into the system. At the moment, running a multiplicity of units is inefficient in cost terms and provides far more places than are required. If we rationalise the system and use a sizeable proportion of the money that will become available to build the new facility, we will still have money left over to put back into the development of the projects. It is my commitment that that should happen, although I am projecting some years into the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that successive Ministers recognise the importance of this initiative and the need to ensure that expenditure is committed to the community-based activities. That assumes that I will not still be doing this job four years hence—not that I do not want to be doing the job four years hence, but there may be
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
another Minister in my place. All the other changes that have taken place over the past four years will be to no avail if we do not follow through and try to provide the young people with some base and some encouragement as they move forward out of criminality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South also raised the issue of Hydebank, to which I gave careful consideration. I shall repeat the point that I made in my opening statement. Although benefits can flow from the land's availability, it is too close to a prison establishment. Everyone there has committed serious offences of different gradation, but we are trying to encourage them away from doing so. If the estate were next door to a senior prison establishment, people would say that it was a training ground, a step to the young offenders centre. We want to break the continuum, so taking young people away from that location became an important consideration.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We shall put a completely new, purpose-built facility at Rathgael, which will cost the considerable sum of about £10 million to £12 million. It will not come cheap, but every penny spent will be worth while.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the plans that the Minister has outlined for Rathgael. Are there also plans to trawl or advertise for a new type of staffing complement for it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have staff with considerable experience and excellence. I said earlier that I did not expect any redundancies among staff, so if staff want to remain in the new system, they will be allowed to do so. We must put more effort into training. As we move to deal with problems in different ways, attention must be paid to the education of staff. Care staff would benefit from training in new ideas and new ways to deal with issues. Such measures must underline the way forward, but there will be no trawling for new staff. The quality of the staff that we have allows us to build on their experience and, through additional training, give them new skills to perform at a higher level.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) asked whether standards are and will be fully upheld in such centres. The answer is yes. If I said no, that would negate everything that I have said. We want to improve standards. We will always consider the best national and international benchmarks, which returns us to the point about staff. Staff will benefit from conferences by hearing of experiences from elsewhere, and will have the best possible bases of knowledge. That knowledge will be fed back in, and I hope that the staff will then demand the best standards of their management by pointing out what is taking place elsewhere and asking whether it can be tried. The centres must have their own dynamic, and must consider what is best all the time. Anyone who understands that process has to accept that mistakes can be made. People will make choices that prove unsuccessful, and if so, they must be quick to change, but they should not simply say that what they have is final.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0660">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
The hon. Gentleman also asked about the success of the new custodial sentences. The final pieces to them were put in place only in January 1999, so we have not had time to reach conclusions. The reoffending rates under the old system were unacceptable, reaching 93 per cent. We shall study what we have done and report on the relevant statistics when we have a sufficient knowledge base. He also asked about consultation with local residents, which will be part of the planning process once we have put the new ideas in place. It is a planning matter, and the residents will have an input. I would not say that that would necessarily be the end of the matter. If there were great public concern about it, representations would be made to me, as the responsible Minister, and the local community would be consulted if it was felt that that would move the process forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether we had listened to the views of staff. As I said, staff can have a great input in solving problems. They have the knowledge base because they work with young people and carry the load. They cannot be given an "answer down" system; whatever is done must evolve from consultation with staff and management about the best way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman then asked whether we would consult the voluntary sector about the reforms. Voluntary organisations already play an important part in tackling the issues raised by youth group crime. The voluntary sector is an integral part of society in Northern Ireland to which we give core funding support, which we intend should continue and, I hope, be improved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, North raised several issues about health provision. Giving people help for clothes and other things is part of trying to encourage people to change their life style. They may have a family background—or a non-family background—where there is no encouragement to change; they may not know how to dress properly or how to have a healthy diet and so on. Helping people in that way also helps them to tackle their offending behaviour. Such problems are found not only in the criminal justice
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
estate, but in the Army, too. Soldiers in some of the regiments say that they have to teach recruits from deprived communities how to use a knife and fork. It is not only offenders who have difficulties with their approach to life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the problem of night staffing, especially in respect of fire safety and suicides, which have an impact on staffing needs. Those issues are taken into consideration when staffing levels—and especially night staffing levels—are assessed. I want the new centre to be constructed, because it will have the best safety systems—camera monitoring, alarm and instance response systems, for example—to prevent young people from setting fire to their accommodation by playing around with the electrical equipment. St. Mary's sets a good example, because it closes down systems and isolates areas to protect young people and staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked whether there was a published system of sanction and rewards. There is such a system in all the existing centres, which must be improved on and adapted for the new centre, to facilitate its effective operation. The system is important to the custodial regime, as there must be a measure against which young people can set themselves. He also asked about staff training needs, a matter to which I responded in answer to a previous question.
