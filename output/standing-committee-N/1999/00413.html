	<div class='title'>Occupational Therapy (Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2.30 pm</p>
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What action the Government will take to reduce waiting lists for occupational therapy assessments in Lagan Valley. [118121]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Responsibility for reducing waiting lists lies with Down-Lisburn trust and the eastern health and social services board. In the past year, the trust increased staffing by one whole-time equivalent occupational therapist. The board is conducting a root and branch review of the occupational therapy service throughout the area to inform future commissioning decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for that reply. However, people in the Down-Lisburn trust area are having to wait for up to a year for occupational therapy assessments to be carried out. They are having to wait in hospital beds until they are able to receive an adequate package for care in the community that will enable them to return to their homes. These problems are costing the health service an enormous amount. Surely there must be some way in which adequate resources can be targeted at reducing the waiting lists for occupational therapy assessments and for care in the community packages. That would enable people who are waiting for vital equipment to be installed to have it installed. It would also allow people who are waiting to return home after a stay in hospital to do so, so that hospital beds can be freed for patients on other waiting lists.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have to recognise that funding is an issue; there is no question about that, although the same argument applies throughout the health sector. It is for boards and trusts to determine funding priorities in the light of what they judge to be the needs of the local population. As I said, additional resources have been put into the occupational therapy service to meet growing demand. Although the occupational therapy service has increased substantially the number of assessments that it is undertaking, demand continues to rise. Housing adaptations are a particular cause of that increase, as more and more dependent people are being helped to live at home rather than in residential accommodation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Budget made available £53 million of additional resources. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is currently engaged in intensive discussions with interested parties within the health sector, health professionals and trade unions to consider the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>2</span>
disbursement of that money. I shall take note of the remarks made by the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) and ensure that my hon. Friend is aware of his concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister direct his attention to the contrast between the Government's policy on waiting lists on this side of the water and their policy in Northern Ireland? On this side of the water, reduced waiting lists have been a key part of the Labour party's policy. It publishes targets and information on them and we regularly hear arguments about their precise circumstances. Why have no target or waiting list figures ever been published in Northern Ireland? Are not Northern Ireland's waiting lists longer than those of Great Britain? Why is it that that, even though more is spent per capita on the health service in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain, the results are poorer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I cannot confirm or deny off the top of my head the detail—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am right.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, the right hon. Gentleman always claims to be right. At some stage, we shall have to debate that, but I am sure that he appreciates that this is not one of the areas for which I have direct responsibility. I take note of his point about the publication of targets, from which flows consideration of how the key critical aspects of the problems should be tackled. I know that the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) is earnestly and determinedly trying to ensure that the Northern Ireland Executive is reinstated. The issue under discussion would of course be one of those for which responsibility would fall to a devolved assembly, which could tackle particular local needs according to the resources that have been allocated. I take note of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks, and I shall pass them on to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister assure me that sufficient attention will be given to the lack of adequate replacements for occupational therapists who are absent from work? Such therapists might not have the mobility to carry out assessment because of genuine illness or might be on longterm maternity leave. Will proper account be taken of the need for substitute and replacement occupational therapists to cover those who are not at work? Will he also assure me that the long waiting list in Lagan valley and across the Province is not part of an engineered outcome to ensure that recommendations meet the budget that is allocated?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We all share a common aim. We want to ensure that the health service provides an adequate—and hopefully more than adequate—service in those critical areas. However, getting trained and qualified staff throughout the health service is an important issue. It is sometimes easier said than done. The Government have initiated a number of approaches to improve the quality and strengthen the number of qualified personnel to take account of absences, including maternity leave. However, I shall draw the hon. Gentleman's point to

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>3</span>
the attention of my ministerial colleague. I share his concerns.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What assessment he has made of the likelihood of decommissioning, as required by the Belfast Agreement, being completed by the May deadline. [118124]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has put on record the Government's view that the realistic prospects for completing decommissioning by 22 May are poor. He has also put on record that decommissioning remains an essential part of the agreement on which we need to make progress as soon as possible. Clearly there must be confidence on all sides that the guns are silenced for good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Good Friday is coming soon. It was a little earlier two year's ago. It is unlikely that decommissioning will be complete within the next six weeks. That is part of the Belfast agreement, which stands or falls as an entirety. It applies to loyalist and republican weapons, but the Minister will agree that the IRA is the key. Will he confirm—he might be unwilling to do so—intelligence reports of many years that McGuinness and Adams have been, and possibly are, on the IRA army council? What discussions has he had with McGuinness and Adams to suggest that they might use their votes to ensure that IRA weapons are handed in? If a substantial number of weapons are not decommissioned by 22 May, will the entire agreement collapse?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Stephen Pound 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ealing, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I shall take points of order after questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government never confirm or deny matters relating to intelligence information for good reasons that the hon. Gentleman should recognise. As for moving the process forward, all interested parties at the forefront of the discussions have made every effort to find a new determined will to make progress. The right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) and the Governments of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, with the help and support of the United States Administration, are doing everything possible to find a new framework to take the process forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I mentioned the importance of decommissioning. It will not go away. It needs to be addressed. We want the guns and the private armies from whatever quarter, whether republican or so-called loyalist, removed from Northern Ireland society. Only by doing that can we achieve real lasting peace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was encouraged during Northern Ireland questions yesterday by the Minister's answer that 22 May was a target rather than the whole purpose of the process. Does he agree that we must ensure that people keep their eye on the ultimate goal of lasting peace rather than on the staging posts? Will he comment on the need to have formal round-table talks now? I ask that because informal talks do not have the same gravitas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Lasting peace is the objective of everyone in the House—there is no question about that—but it is not a desire of everyone in Northern Ireland. We have seen all too graphically the attempts made by dissident republican groups to try to destabilise the peace. There are many instances of violence of a different nature on the so-called loyalist side; the consequences could none the less still be potent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must bear that in mind as we move the process forward. All-party talks are part of the on-going process. There are several bilateral and multilateral discussions between the parties. Several parties sometimes feel disengaged from the process, but they have regular contact with Ministers and, of their own volition, have contact with the other major parties involved in the discussions. Everyone is a part of the overall process. All the pro-agreement parties can bring something to the table and it is a matter of judgment as to when—if at all—such an approach might be adopted as a means of reaching conclusions. The approach is not the only option for reaching the ultimate conclusion that we all seek.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister turn his mind back to the previous occasion on which the Government and the parties formally addressed the issues, which was in the Mitchell review? Will he recall that the Mitchell review ended last November on the basis that we would proceed to devolution as quickly as possible—which we did—and that decommissioning would follow as soon as possible? That was said by George Mitchell to be the position of all the parties and of the Government. Does the Minister recall that, at that time, the Secretary of State said clearly and publicly that, if there were a failure to act by any party in accordance with those understandings, the Government would ensure that those who defaulted would not gain by virtue of such default? Is the Government's position still that those who default should not benefit from that default?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister may be aware that the hon. Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon) has confirmed today in 	<i>The Irish Times</i> that there was a clear understanding that decommissioning should begin by 31 January. The time scale was two months. Does the Minister agree that, if people then talk about having longer time scales or no time scales at all, that would constitute enabling those who defaulted to benefit by virtue of their intransigence, and that that would be wrong?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister share my concern about the way in which the Irish Government, and the new Irish Foreign Minister in particular, seem to have gone out of their way since 11 February to give as much comfort as possible to those who defaulted? They have done little to honour the understandings and undertakings given by the Government in November of last year.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am only too well aware of the framework within which we reached agreement—if that is the way to describe it—in the Mitchell discussions last year. The Secretary of State made his statement about no one gaining from default. His statement was borne out by the fact that he then reluctantly suspended the Executive and thereby the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0591">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
Assembly. The move was taken reluctantly in the sense that the option had to be taken, but none of us ever wanted to have to take it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those who have defaulted have not gained; everyone has lost as a consequence of the action. We have said consistently that there is no easy road down which we can go; there is no simple solution. The right hon. Gentleman knows only too well the pressures within his party. I recognise fully his difficulties in trying to bring forward people who are hostile to what he is trying to achieve, in order to bring about the lasting peace of which we spoke earlier, in terms of how the agreement is implemented. No one should gain by default, and the Government stand by that. We must ensure that everyone gains by achieving a lasting peace, which is what the right hon. Gentleman, the Government and the Irish Government seek to achieve.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strangford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recall that the constitution of the Republic of Ireland provides that there shall be one Government and one army? There is no place for people in government and two armies. That means that members of the Republican movement, with illegal arms and a private army, cannot serve in that Government. Is there not an inconsistency in the Dublin Government suggesting to Northern Ireland that we should have in our Government people who have a private army, without any decommissioning of illegal arms?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am only too conscious of the constitution of the Republic of Ireland, but it would be inappropriate for me to comment on or discuss that constitution—[HON MEMBERS: "Ah."]—much as right hon. and hon. Gentlemen seek to encourage me to do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman's real point is about the status of the signing up to the peace process by pro-agreement parties. That is implicit and explicit within the Mitchell principles and the Good Friday agreement, and that objective must be obtained as part of the lasting political settlement. That is why I said earlier that we want to see the private armies and guns totally removed from all quarters of Northern Ireland. That is the only way to achieve lasting peace. The political process can work only when people do not have the threat of violence hanging over them or when violence cannot be used to threaten and harass others. Therefore, I share the right hon. Gentleman's overall sentiment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister realise that although everyone wants decommissioning, there is a more practical aspect to the matter? Every week, we hear about guns being used in so-called punishment beatings. The general public are even more determined that decommissioning should take place before certain things happen. Will the Minister tell us whether there has been any success in catching those people who carry out punishment beatings, which sometimes seem to occur three or four days a week without any result? It seems to the general public that those people can simply do what they like.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share totally the hon. Gentleman's sentiments about paramilitary assaults, so-called punishment beatings. One is too many. They are a complete denial of human rights and natural justice. That is victimisation by kangaroo courts of people within their own community. The Government unreservedly condemn that. On the issue of bringing people to justice, the Royal Ulster Constabulary makes strenuous efforts to tackle all types of crime in Northern Ireland, but they are frustrated in achieving that objective by the fact that in most cases, the victims do not cooperate with the police. I make a plea to anyone who has information about any such crimes to serve the cause of Northern Ireland and the cause of peace by giving that evidence to the RUC so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that it is now two years since the Belfast agreement was concluded. On the Good Friday on which the agreement was signed, the Prime Minister wrote a letter to my right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) in which he said that he expected decommissioning to begin immediately. He also went on to say that if those who hold ministerial office fail to honour their obligations and commit themselves to peaceful means, the Government and the Prime Minister would support changes to the mechanisms for excluding them from office. If, by 22 May, the IRA has not decommissioned its illegal weapons, will the Prime Minister honour the undertakings that he gave to my right hon. Friend? Will he support changes to the legislation to provide effective exclusion mechanisms, so that the Executive can be reestablished, with those who fail to commit themselves to peaceful means and to decommission their illegal weapons being excluded from office, without vetoing further political progress?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should love to be able to speak on behalf of the Prime Minister and to go through his thought processes. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] That type of sedentary comment is unwarranted, given that the Prime Minister has put so much time and energy into the peace process?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are not planning for failure. We have always sought to plan for success, which is why so much effort has been put in by my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State, the Taoiseach and the US Administration, and why the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) and his colleagues have been unstinting in their efforts. All are trying to answer to that difficult conundrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have to find answers, but we cannot say precisely what will happen one, two, three, five or seven weeks ahead. We, therefore, cannot plan for every minutiae of those eventualities, because that feeds those who want the process to fail. I realise that the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) does not want the process to fail, although he may object to some of the building blocks. He wants to achieve the overall objective, which is a normalised and peaceful society in Northern Ireland. I ask him to support those who are trying to achieve that objective. He should put his questions to one side for a few weeks

In any event, if there was evidence, it would have to be proved in a court of law. It cannot be left to ministerial fiat to decide that someone has breached the licence. Every released prisoner is out on very strict criteria, the prime one being that the licence can be revoked. One prisoner has had his licence revoked. Several others who have been released have been involved in other crimes, but none of them has been judged to have breached their licence. However, we keep the matter constantly under review, and we are conscious at all times that those who breach their licence conditions are denying others the opportunity to find a way to a more peaceful future. I remind the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) that if he has any information about licences having been breached or about released prisoners carrying out such crimes, the best thing to do is to put it to the RUC and allow the police to investigate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Apprehending those responsible for the Omagh bombing is a matter for the police, and I know that the RUC continues to devote considerable resources to the task.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I appreciate the tremendous work that has been done by the RUC and the Garda in trying to apprehend those people, the Minister will realise that although they know who perpetrated the crime they cannot find enough evidence to convict them. Many people in Omagh are greatly discouraged by the statement made by the Commissioner of the Garda that they are never likely to be caught. Indeed, press leaks have been made saying that the Chief Constable of the RUC thinks the same. Does the Minister agree that it would be a travesty if those men were not brought to justice? Does he further agree that it would be an unjust system that allowed people whom the security forces know to be involved in terrorism to continue to plan acts of terrorism and, in some cases, carry them out? Surely there must be some mechanism for stopping that? If not, it is a great injustice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would never respond to unsourced comments in the press about the views of the Chief Constable. I do not know whether it has happened to the hon. Gentleman, but I have found many times that I have been reported to have adopted positions that are the opposite of the truth. I do not always believe
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
what I read in the newspapers and I always question why information is presented as it is. I therefore discount the assertion that the Chief Constable holds the views that the hon. Gentleman alleges him to hold. The Chief Constable and all of his officers are putting any amount of effort into bringing the criminals to justice. That must remain the prime aim of the RUC, working in consultation with the Garda.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We again make the plea for anyone with information to give it to the police, stand by their evidence and bring the perpetrators of this terrible crime to justice. We make that plea not just on behalf of victims' families and the extended number of people who were injured in that terrible atrocity, but for everyone's sake. It is made to everyone who claims to stand by the principles of democracy and the rule of law. If people have information, they should give it to the police and bring the criminals to justice. That would help not only the victims and their families but the maintenance of good order within Northern Ireland society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

If there is a difficulty in obtaining satisfactory evidence, should not the Government be willing to issue a joint appeal with the Irish Government, which could be accompanied by incentives? I might even suggest making rewards available to witnesses to encourage them to come forward and provide evidence that might bring the terrorists to justice.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have not considered the issue in terms of rewarding people for evidence, but I take careful note of the hon.

However, I believe that the lack of evidence runs much deeper. On the basis of the information provided, I believe that there is tremendous resistance within the particular section of the community from which the perpetrators come to any sort of co-operation with the Royal Ulster Constabulary. That resistance applies not only in relation to the Omagh atrocity but in relation to a range of crimes committed by Republican terrorists.

Northern Ireland My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland have made clear their responses to the Patten report, which was produced by the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, and have expressed the Government's settled will.

We will shortly enter into the legislative process in respect of the changes and the type of arguments advanced by the right hon. Gentleman. He may wish to serve on the Committee that will consider those changes, and if he does I shall look forward to having many exchanges with him on the shape of the legislation.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's response, taken in parallel with the Republic of Ireland Government, was a clear attempt to help to bring the perpetrators of that crime to justice. The mechanism is given in the first instance to the police; they decide the way in which they use it. The matter is not one for government direction. It is for the Chief Constable of Northern Ireland and the police officers investigating the crime to make an operational judgment on whether they can use information that they have and on whether they can secure a conviction.

[	<i>Relevant Document: The Second Report from the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Session 1999–2000, on Current Problems relating to the Livestock Industry in Northern Ireland, HC 62.</i>]
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no disputing the fact that agriculture in Northern Ireland has gone through a difficult four years starting, of course, with the onset of the BSE crisis in 1996. Although that event marked the beginning of the downturn in the industry's fortunes, subsequent developments have also played a major role. Those include the strengthening of sterling and a weakening of international markets for many of the main agricultural commodities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The scale and nature of the problem has been highlighted recently in the report of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee entitled 	<i>"Current Problems Relating to the Livestock Industry in Northern Ireland".</i> I welcome the report. It provides a thoughtful examination of the issues involved and adds to the body of knowledge on a way forward for the industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since 1996, the aggregate income of the industry in Northern Ireland has fallen by almost 80 per cent. in real terms, which is well ahead of the 60 per cent. reduction across the UK as a whole. Although the 1995 income level in Northern Ireland was at a historic high, the 1999 figure represented a 19-year low. It would be wrong to suggest that the situation in Northern Ireland is worse than anywhere else in the UK. The income fall in Wales has been even more severe and the industry there, which is of a similar size and structure, has an aggregate income of only half that of the industry in Northern Ireland. It would also be wrong to suggest that the Government have not recognised the difficulties or done nothing about them in Northern Ireland, Wales or anywhere else in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since coming to power in 1997, the Government have introduced numerous measures to assist the agriculture industry in its current difficulties. Agrimonetary compensation was paid in 1997, 1998 and 1999. It will also be paid this year and next year. Substantial sums are involved that are paid for largely by the UK taxpayer. Last year, the UK agriculture industry received a great deal more than £260 million in agrimonetary compensation. This year, a further £154 million will be provided, including the £66 million announced by the Prime Minister at the agriculture summit at the end of March.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry in Northern Ireland is benefiting in full from the compensation packages, with total payments expected to exceed £30 million during those two years, but the Government's response to the difficulties has gone further than providing agrimonetary compensation. The particular difficulties of hill farmers have been tackled by injecting a substantial amount of cash into the less
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
favoured areas through the hill livestock compensatory scheme. Government provision for the 1999 and 2000 schemes was increased by £60 million across the UK. Northern Ireland hill farmers received £8.5 million of that in each of the two years. At last month's agriculture summit, the Prime Minister announced that a further £60 million will be made available for the 2001 scheme and that future funding would be considered in the forthcoming spending review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Recognising the importance of the beef and dairy sectors in Northern Ireland, the Government have asked the European Commission to remove the weight limit that applies to the over-30-month scheme as soon as possible. If agreed, that will represent a welcome cash boost for both sectors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the steps that the Government are taking. There was a lot of genuine grievance that farmers were not adequately compensated for the real value of culled animals. How long will it take the Commission to say yea or nay?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Unfortunately, I cannot give a time, but the matter is being actively impressed on the European Commission, which knows the scale of the problem. We can only hope that we obtain an early decision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The pig industry in Northern Ireland has also been under severe strain. The tremendous difficulties that it has faced in the past two years reflect an EU-wide imbalance between supply and demand. Although the pig market is notoriously cyclical, the latest downturn has been especially prolonged and harsh. I welcome the first signs of recovery that are evident in the marketplace. The price per kilo for pigs is increasing, although it has flattened out in recent weeks. None the less, there is a healthy trend that might alleviate some of the problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government's ability to provide financial assistance to the pig industry is severely curtailed by the limits imposed by EU state aid rules. There are good reasons for the rules. They are designed to prevent unfair competition and achieve a level playing field throughout Europe. Hon. Members from Northern Ireland will be aware of the fire at the pig processing factory in Ballymoney in 1998 and the difficulties that that created with the build-up of stocks of live animals on farms. They will also know about the Government's scheme to remove the unsaleable pigs from the marketplace. Despite the fact that the scheme was introduced in response to new circumstances and was designed to alleviate the severe animal welfare problem, it did not secure EU state aid approval, although the European Commission took no action against the Department. More recent informal approaches to the Commission, for example on the possibility of subsidising the disposal of pig offal—an important part of the pig farming industry—were met with a firm rebuttal. That illustrates the difficulty that we face in securing European approval for action in that sector. However, the Government have done much to assist the pig industry where possible, including lobbying for enhanced EU export refunds and the provision of private storage aid.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0595">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
In October last year, the Government made available £5 million to assist UK marketing initiatives, primarily in the pig sector, and Northern Ireland received £400,000 share of that sum. Proposals from the industry on how those funds should be deployed have been received and will focus on the key issue of improving the quality of pigs produced in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister announced at last month's agriculture summit a three-year pig industry restructuring programme aimed at improving its long-term viability. Some £26 million have been earmarked for the first year of the programme, with future funding to be considered in the context of the spending review. Precise details of the scheme have still to be agreed with the EU Commission, but I am sure that it will have a major impact in securing the long-term future of the industry in the UK, and I assure the Committee that the Northern Ireland industry will receive its full share of the available funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All those measures and the proactive approach adopted by the Government, both in Northern Ireland and the UK, show the priority given to the issue by Government. Indeed, the Prime Minister has shown a high level of commitment to, and engagement with, the industry, with a view to helping to find solutions to the many problems facing the industry. Even given that level of involvement, there is a clear need for the industry itself at all levels to look to its own long-term development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agri-food sector has a future, but it is not guaranteed and will be secured only on the back of a dynamic programme of change. Of course, many influences will impinge on the fortunes of the industry over the coming decade. World trade liberalisation under the World Trade Organisation and enlargement of the EU, leading to further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, will all happen within the next 10 years, radically altering the policy environment in which the industry operates. Markets, too, will change and become more competitive as a result of greater demands from an increasingly sophisticated consumer body. Issues, such as food safety, animal welfare and environmental protection, will all assume a higher prominence. All that will pose a great challenge to the industry, but it will also offer great opportunities if the industry embraces the challenge.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As hon. Members will be aware, the Prime Minister announced a range of longer-term measures at the agriculture summit in March aimed at helping farmers to make their businesses more resilient, efficient and responsive. Those include measures to ensure that Government, farmers and the food industry work together to improve the profitability of the industry; to minimise the cost and bureaucratic burden on farmers; and to ensure that the Government work to secure a more market-orientated CAP by removing production controls and simplifying bureaucracy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the key announcements relating to Northern Ireland was the confirmation that a formal case, proposing low BSE incidence status, had been submitted to the EU Commission. Initial discussions on that have already taken place between EU and UK
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
officials and I will do everything in my power to ensure that the case is progressed as quickly as possible. However, the difficulties associated with that should not be underestimated. As well as gainers there could be losers elsewhere within the agri-food industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the summit, the Prime Minister also referred to the opportunities under the EU regulation on rural development. Rural development is now commonly referred to as the second pillar of the CAP and is likely to assume an increasingly important role in future. Plans for Northern Ireland have been submitted to the EU Commission for approval, which we expect to secure later this year. They will build on measures contained in the last structure funds plan and will allow for the expansion of programmes such as agri-environment schemes, organic farming and forestry. To that end, the Government will supplement the funds provided by the EU through Treasury match funding, and an additional £38 million will be provided in Northern Ireland over the lifetime of the plan. That will greatly enhance our ability to deliver significant benefits to the rural economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, as previously announced outside the Committee and following on from the agriculture summit, I have reactivated the exercise that is aimed at developing a strategic vision for the future of the agri-food industry in Northern Ireland. That was initiated during the time of the devolved Administration, and although we all wish that it could have proceeded under that Administration, the issue is too important to held in abeyance. I shall meet industry representatives during the next week or two to chart the way forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now, if never before, the industry must look to its long-term development, to prepare itself to meet the challenges that undoubtedly lie ahead and to help deliver a robust, vibrant and sustainable rural economy. To say that a crisis faces the farming industry only feeds the short-term headline writers. It does not produce a future. Many difficult challenges face the industry, but many opportunities lie ahead. The Government are prepared to play their part. I know that the industry in Northern Ireland is prepared to face those challenges head on, and together we can achieve a better long-term future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is an opportune time to consider the agriculture industry in Northern Ireland. Indeed, I think that all right hon. and hon. Members will agree that the report of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs on the current problems of the livestock industry in Northern Ireland is an excellent document. It has been thoroughly researched and tribute must be paid to the members of that Committee, who visited Northern Ireland on several occasions and listened attentively to the representations made to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report highlights what we have been saying for some time about the difficulties of the agriculture industry in Northern Ireland. We appreciate that agriculture in United Kingdom is in a bad state, but agriculture in England is only a small part of the whole community; in Northern Ireland and, as the Minister
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0596">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
said, in Wales, is it very important. In Northern Ireland, for example, agriculture contributes 10 per cent. of civil employment—almost 60,000 jobs—and 6 per cent. of gross domestic product. Not only that, but the agri-food industry generates about 20 per cent. of Northern Ireland's manufacturing sector's external sales.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During the past few years, £604 million has been removed from the Province's economy due to the farming crisis, which represents a loss of 79 per cent. of income. That has meant many farmers owing a tremendous amount of money to the banks—it is estimated that they owe £520 million, and interest will doubtless be due on that. That takes no account of the money owed to feed suppliers, who have been extremely patient with farmers who have not been able to pay their bills. It is a tremendous crisis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report highlights those matters and recommends several solutions. To some extent the report has been overtaken by the recent Prime Minister's summit and the subsequent statement. We accept that those things are not easy because we are in Europe, but Europe seems to have a lot of say in all that we do and we seem to have to seek its agreement to almost everything that we do. The Minister's scope for action is therefore limited. However, for what it is worth, we do have the package, especially the £16.9 million that will be coming to Northern Ireland—£1.5 million to sheep farmers, £2.4 to milk production, £8.5 to hill farmers and £4.5 million to the beef sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is welcome, but it does not mean much to the individual farmer. I understand that the milk farmers will receive £9 per animal. Even for farmers with a large herd, that will be only about £1,000. That is not much in relation to the strength of the milk sector. Again, £1.5 million for sheep farmers is not much for each animal. However, we must be thankful for small mercies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We in Northern Ireland are particularly thankful for the pressure applied by the National Farmers Union. Farmers on the mainland are able to vote for the Labour party, but we cannot do that in Northern Ireland. Whether we would, even if we had the opportunity, is another question. When farmers on the mainland rise up, the Government take note. I suspect that this package is due to the valiant efforts of the farmers. Otherwise, we did not have much hope that the Government would do much more.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The package promised to the United Kingdom includes £56 million for the pig industry. We do not know how it will be spent. There is talk of restructuring the industry, but what does that mean? Does it mean that those who wish to leave the industry will receive a contribution? Will it offer help to those who have staunchly stayed in the industry, despite the disadvantages, in the hope that things would improve? I am amazed at the resilience and determination of pig farmers; many of them have stayed in the industry when economic arguments suggested that they should leave. The tragedy in Northern Ireland is that so many have left the industry. In fact, 40 per cent. of the pig
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
industry in Northern Ireland has disappeared. Indeed, two pig factories have closed, one in Enniskillen and the other in Ahoshill, with the loss of about 300 jobs. That shows the decrease that has taken place in the pig industry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We hope that what has been promised will be delivered. I know that the matter has to be considered in Europe, and that it will be dissected there to see whether it will infringe any rules. I hope that before the Government announced the package, they talked to Europe and found out whether their proposals would be approved. It would be a bad blow to the pig industry to discover that what they had been promised would not be delivered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take this opportunity to say how much the farming community in Northern Ireland appreciated the visit of Her Majesty the Queen to Balmoral yesterday. They took it as an indication of her sympathy for and knowledge of the farming crisis in Northern Ireland. The fact that she met with the farming community and spoke to farmers was much appreciated. They are assured of her support, which is certainly a fillip to the agricultural sector in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the over-30-month scheme, I welcome the assurance that the weight limit will be removed. There was speculation that it might be increased, but in Agriculture questions today it was confirmed that the limit would be going. I appreciate that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the efforts that are being made on BSE. Those of us who have been involved since the start thought that it would be a simple process, but we have discovered many difficulties. Farmers in low BSE incidence areas have problems with abattoirs. There are also problems with other people in Northern Ireland because of restrictions between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. None of us fully understands the problems, but the scheme that the Department has put to Europe has got around many of them. I hope that there will be a positive response at an early date so that more cattle will be exported from Northern Ireland to other parts of Europe and, indeed, the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Department of Agriculture's new name—the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. That typifies and highlights the change that is taking place in agriculture and the importance that the Department places on that rural development. The first seed of rural development was planted in 1991. It has grown into the present scheme of LEADER 2. The package will conclude in April next year. We are pleased that rural development will continue through Interreg 3 and the LEADER-plus scheme. Some £50 million to £60 million was involved in the rural development scheme. The Minister mentioned £38 million. Is that a different category of money?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Department issued an announcement after the summit that raised several issues, including schemes that related to horses in England and Wales. The horse industry is a budding industry in Northern Ireland. Will we also have a scheme? The announcement went on to say:
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0597">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
	<br><q><p>The Government will consult publicly on proposals to extend rate relief to other horse enterprises linked to foreign premises. This will require primary legislation.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that established blacksmiths and farriers in rural areas of Northern Ireland are worried? People have undergone training and developed skills in horse management, such as horse-shoeing and feet-trimming. They are worried that too many do-it-yourself operators, who have had no training, are appearing on the scene. Their position would be strengthened if the Government were to undertake an examination of what is going on, and perhaps introduce regulation for those who have had training to recognise their skills and qualifications.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I am sure that the Minister will take those remarks to heart. Another point about rural diversification is that it involves planning legislation. Perhaps the Department will consider that and seek to ease the transition process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another problem that has been mentioned to me is the introduction of ear tags for animals—one tag in each ear. Those tags are now plastic and quite large. Consequently, they are easily removed if they get caught on a wire or in a hedge, and it is difficult to obtain replacements. Perhaps the Department could consider the possibility of electronic tagging, which would make life a bit easier for farmers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to fishing. As the Minister is aware, there is a small, strident fishing industry in Northern Ireland. I recently attended a meeting of fishermen there. I have attended some robust meetings in my time, but I assure the Minister that this one was very robust, due to the introduction of a box in the Irish sea where they can no longer fish for cod. I appreciate that conservation is necessary, but there is not always agreement between scientists and fishermen. It would be desirable to have a mechanism for agreeing on the nature and extent of the conservation that is necessary.

At the meeting, I was lobbied about the fact that in the recent negotiations, Belgium was granted 200 tonnes of fishing from the UK—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I invite the hon.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to the problem that the fishermen pointed out to me, I received clarification from the Minister during Agriculture questions today and the matter can therefore be laid to rest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have tried to cover some of the problems that exist in the farming industry in Northern Ireland. I welcome the initiatives that the Government have taken—although they may be too little, too late—and hope that there will be more. Given that plans are being made to reconstruct the farming industry within the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
entire United Kingdom, I hope that we can look forward to a brighter future for the industry in the Province.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend has covered the vast majority of the points that need to be addressed. I, too, declare a small interest. I have an interest in a small beef herd, so stand to gain from the benefits that have been announced. Having said that, I do not think that it would be possible to over-stress the serious loss to the Northern Ireland economy in the past two years. The hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) rightly referred to the difficulties that farmers are having with banks and suppliers. I spoke to the proprietor of a small rural business just two Saturdays ago. He told me how he had sent out almost 1,000 monthly accounts and, after he had received what was, virtually, a nil response, his wife persuaded him to call personally at the farms. It was, he said, the most embarrassing and humiliating experience of his 25 years in business. He was embarrassed to call for his own money and to see the embarrassment, in turn, of his customers, who were unable to make even small cash payments towards their debts. The situation is serious.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem has been exacerbated by the fact that, over the years, farmers in Northern Ireland built up intensive pig, poultry meat and egg-producing units on their smallholdings. Such businesses, run by the head of the household with part-time assistance from other members of the family, were sufficient to provide an income. The losses have been tremendous, so we welcome the announcements that have been made and the action plan for agriculture in Northern Ireland that has been put forward by the Prime Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister give us an assurance that every opportunity for our Government to pay agrimonetary compensation has been taken? I am concerned at the indications that payment is for this year only. If we are to plan a way through the difficulties that lie ahead and restructure agriculture, we will need to have support over a longer term. That is the only way to get it right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of the loss of confidence for our young people's future and the fact that the average age of those who own farm businesses in Northern Ireland is rather higher than the national average, can the Minister tell us whether the Government are seriously considering the possibility of assisting an early retirement scheme for farmers, with the support of the European Union? Such a scheme would allow people to exit the occupation to which they have given a lifetime with some dignity, rather than stagger on for a few more years and end up bankrupt and on the street without a roof over their head.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problems affecting Northern Ireland agriculture are similar to those in Welsh agriculture, and the Minister rightly made that comparison. Indeed, I visited Northern Ireland yesterday and this morning to make meaningful comparisons with the help of the experts. I thank Alistair McLaughlin and Wesley Aston from the Ulster Farmers Union, and Miceal McCoy from the Northern Ireland Agricultural Produce Association, who gave me their insights, which I found very useful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The crisis in farming, which is echoed all over the United Kingdom, is a deep economic crisis. I shall not dwell on that because we are all familiar with it, but it is clear to all of us that something needs to change and to change quickly, or there will not be much of an agriculture industry left in the not-too-distant future. The big problem is that farming is not viable. The statistics speak for themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The importance of agriculture in Northern Ireland has been underlined. It accounts for almost three times more economic activity than the UK average, it is the major driving force in the rural economy, as in Wales, and, most seriously as we have heard, about £750,000 has been removed from the Province's economy over the past five years as a result of the crisis. The Minister rightly said that there has been a 79 per cent. drop in real terms in total annual farm income. That is not a sustainable state of affairs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hill farming incomes in Northern Ireland plummeted by 95 per cent. in net terms in 1998–99, so the average hill farm in Northern Ireland now generates £200 net income a year. The prediction is that that will be a negative figure in 1999–2000. Worse still, farm incomes in Northern Ireland are falling at twice the UK average. Not surprisingly, as a result farmers now owe over £520 million to banks—a figure that continues to grow.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A simple example of that is the dairy industry. In the Newry and Morne district there are about 360 dairy farmers and 16,000 cows, which produce about 80 million litres of milk a year. The economic cost to that area of a 1p a litre drop is £800,000. Over the past four years there was an 8p a litre drop, which equates to £6.5 million a year or £26 million across the four years that has simply disappeared from the local economy. That is not sustainable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister is clearly sensitive to these issues. I cite that as an example, but the same is true of the pig and sheep industries. The pig industry is on its knees, because it is barely economic at present to run pig farming. If there is any further decline in pig turnover, we shall see wide-scale bankruptcies and farm closures in that industry,
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is all depressing and economically of great concern. There is also an animal welfare issue here, because there comes a point when farmers can barely afford to look after themselves, let alone their animals. With the best will in the world, desperate people sometimes end up taking desperate measures.
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>20</span>
Although I do not condone the abandonment of livestock, people who so do are by and large law abiding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is simply a way of dealing with their plight.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to dwell on the problem further, because we are all familiar with it. The important question is what can we do about it? First, the Committee will agree that the exchange rate is a terribly debilitating problem for all exporters and none more so than farmers. Secondly, BSE has had a direct and negative influence on the beef industry. A third issue is the tendency of Governments to try to solve economic problems in the agricultural sector in a tactical rather than strategic way and to fix the problem in the short term rather than try to create long-term viability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has done good work in obtaining new money for agriculture, and that has been welcomed. I am not convinced that it was £200 million of new money, but there was some new money. That will help to tide us over in the short term, but will not create the level playing field that farmers need. By the same token, there has been great progress in the lifting of the beef ban, but we have not won the markets back to any great extent. Those macro problems continue to affect the whole of the United Kingdom and not just Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let us consider more specifically what we may be able to do for Northern Ireland. Reference has been made to agrimonetary compensation and I hope that the Minister will tell us whether the Government intend to take up all the available agrimonetary compensation for the arable, beef and sheep sectors in forthcoming years. Clarification of that is important because it will help farmers to plan for the future. Farming is an investment-intensive industry and changes cannot be made quickly. The more guidance that can be given, the better it will be for farmers. It is also important to recognise that compensation will not solve the problem. If the pound remains high, the exchange rate will have a terrible impact on our chances of reclaiming lost markets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question is about the extent to which creative solutions exist to deal with the exchange rate problem. Compensation will help, but we need a long-term strategy so that farmers can be sure of receiving on-going compensation for high exchange rates, which are damaging to the industry. I am a realist and I am not convinced that that is a way forward, so the Minister will not stand condemned if he throws his hands up in despair. His facial expression says it all and would launch a thousand disappointments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One comment that the Minister would expect me, as a Liberal Democrat, to make is that entry to the euro would provide stability. Whether we like it or not, farmers are coming round to the view that they would benefit from entry to the euro at the right level, but not at an over-valued level. Members of the Committee have the right to differ in their opinion, but in Wales, the prospect of stability in the exchange rate has caused a change of opinion with regard to the euro and perhaps the Minister will convey to his boss the appeal
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0599">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
that the euro now holds for many farmers, although not all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland has been unfairly affected by the impact of BSE because it is a low BSE area according to objective measures. It has the lowest incidence in the British Isles. In 1998, the incidence of BSE in England and Wales was 500 per million, in Scotland it was 36.4 per million, in the Republic of Ireland it was 21.5 per million and in Northern Ireland it was only 8.9 per million. Northern Ireland does not benefit from being classified as a low BSE area because it has not been given the opportunity to do so, but it has taken measures in relation to meat and bonemeal importation and consumption, animal waste rendering, notification, investigation, monitoring, BSE education programmes and cattle traceability recording systems. Those measures give it a head start over the rest of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, if it were possible to isolate the cases of BSE occurring in the dairy herd in Northern Ireland from contact with the beef herd, we might quickly establish a clear case for saying that the beef herd in Northern Ireland was BSE-free?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. It would be feasible to do that partly because of the size of the Province and partly because it has such a low level of BSE. It is an exceptional case in relation to the British Isles as a whole. Northern Ireland is suffering some discrimination against this product. The Republic of Ireland, which has a much higher incidence of BSE, is not subject to the same kind of discrimination. The Minister would be wise to examine those figures and to recognise that the ability to isolate a low incidence zone from a high incidence zone is clearly achievable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland could readily and effectively achieve such isolation from Great Britain in every respect; in paperwork terms as well as in the obvious geographical sense. This is an instance in which Ministers could make a profoundly important contribution towards helping the beef sector to recover. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we could probably achieve zero BSE in the beef herd with a bit of planning. I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall move on to the question of the dairy herds. Milk is selling for about 17p a litre in Northern Ireland, compared to about 15p a litre in the rest of the United Kingdom. That is because when Milk Marque was broken up—a decision that I lament; it was a bad call throughout the UK—the United Dairy Farmers organisation, which more or less performs the same role in Northern Ireland, remained in existence. 70 per cent. of farmers subscribe to it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The lesson is that if we want the dairy sector to help itself, United Dairy Farmers should get the unequivocal support of the Government and an assurance that no interference will take place. I am not suggesting that there has been any such interference, but I would like an assurance that United Dairy Farmers will be allowed to carry on operating autonomously, as it has so far. There are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>22</span>
other issues relating to dairy herds that I shall not go into now, but if the milk price continues to fall, the crisis will worsen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have discussed the question of the sheep industry many times in relation to Wales. I do not need to repeat those arguments, because they have already been put forward in the debate. Compensation can make a practical impact in this area, as long as we find other ways to support sheep farming in the long term to make it viable again. Sheep farmers do not want to live on subsidies and compensation; they want to be viable in their own right. That requires a bigger strategy, to which I shall return later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Pig farmers repeatedly say that they want a level playing field. They feel that animal welfare standards, which are applied more rigorously in the United Kingdom than on the continent, are causing a cost differential for the producer. We have discussed that matter before and it must be addressed. The problem in Northern Ireland is no different from the problem anywhere else in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many farmers are trapped in the industry economically, and they want to get out. I have raised this issue in other Committees. There is a strong desire for a retirement scheme and, as the farmers in Northern Ireland look across the border to the south of Ireland, they see an opportunity there that is not available to them in the north. Even if the United Kingdom as a whole does not introduce a retirement scheme, will the Minister consider introducing a more formalised scheme than exists at present for Northern Ireland's farmers?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering farming in Northern Ireland, I recognise that farmers have made it their business to look after the countryside that we often take for granted. In a way, our countryside is their business. We are investing not only in them but in a culture that defines the appearance of Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. We should not regard these payments simply as social payments to farmers because we get something real in return—enjoyment of the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am glad to hear that Commissioner Burns will attend the Ulster Farmers Union's annual general meeting to discuss these matters, and I hope that the Minister will also consider sending a representative. Farmers are not shouting simply for the sake of making noise; they are arguing cogently on behalf of an industry that is in crisis. Those problems are the more galling for Tesco's announcement of a pre-tax profit of £931 million, at a time when its suppliers—the farmers—are on their knees. I am sure that they would welcome the chance to speak in person to the Minister's representative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister can answer only one of my questions, can he say whether he is willing to explore with Ulster's farmers a strategic, rather than a tactical, approach to the problems associated with rural life and agriculture in Northern Ireland? If a viable solution can be found, I suspect that it would be applicable.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Although I answered that question during my earlier comments, perhaps I may answer it
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0600">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>23</span>
again now, given that the hon. Gentleman has to leave the Committee shortly. One proposal that the devolved Administration considered was a strategic future for farming and I have decided to reactivate it. If my memory serves me right, I shall meet the main players in the next week to consider ways in which that proposal can be taken forward.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I said that I would make matters easy for the Minister and he has made matters easy for me. That is a sensible idea. More to the point, it is probably the right way in which to investigate in detail the issues that have been raised today. I thank him for that assurance, which is good news for farmers in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In conclusion, the findings are also rightly applicable to less-favoured areas in the rest of the United Kingdom. This is one occasion when detailed work undertaken in respect of Northern Ireland could have beneficial spin-offs. It could provide creative solutions to the debilitating problems of rural economic life in the United Kingdom as a whole.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.57 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Gareth R. Thomas 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, West)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik), who brings to this debate a deep knowledge and experience of agricultural matters in his own constituency. I congratulate him on securing agreement on an important point from my right hon. Friend the Minister and I hope that I shall enjoy similar success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise a narrow and specific issue that relates to agriculture in Northern Ireland. I want to highlight the potential of energy derived from biomass sources and energy crops. What can my right hon. Friend the Minister do to promote the use of such crops in Northern Ireland? Energy crops offer new sources of income for farmers and others who work in the agriculture industry. They also help us to meet our renewable energy and climate change targets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth restating that the Department of Trade and Industry estimates that some 10,000 to 45,000 new jobs will be created in Britain—many of which will be created in Northern Ireland's agricultural industry—as we move towards achieving the UK's overall target of 10 per cent. of electricity from renewables by 2010.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Research by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth suggests that perhaps twice as many jobs could be created. Achieving that 10 per cent. target would also help to deliver 25 per cent. of Britain's target for carbon dioxide emission reductions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There will be a real synthesis between achieving our environmental objectives and helping the Northern Ireland agricultural industry if the potential for energy crops can be increased.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Business is already seriously exploring the opportunities for renewable energy. Powergen, National Power, BP Amoco and Shell all have renewable arms. Renewable energy powers the Dome in Greenwich, Gatwick's north terminal and many key Government buildings in the United States.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
The main renewable sources of energy that are likely to help us to achieve the 10 per cent. target are wind energy, energy from waste and—crucially in the context of today's debate—energy crops. Those energy crops most ready for commercial exploitation are short rotation coppice and miscanthus. Energy crops are also thought likely to have a role to play in the long term, and the Government are funding strategic research and development to underpin their future development. The most promising energy crop is willow—short rotation coppice—in which the trees are grown in a bushy form and cut down every three years to produce wood chip. MAFF, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Forestry Commission have worked for some years on the development of short rotation coppice as an alternative fuel source.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is obviously a master of his subject. I should like to ask him whether those who crop timber find that it leads to acidification of the ground. Trees become alkaline in the course of their growth, and if they do not fall to the ground, but are cropped away, it is liable to render the environment acid.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. Many people in the forestry industry believe that energy crops have significant potential and think that they will help to put right some of the problems that he identified in his intervention. I look forward to hearing him join with me in urging the further promotion of energy crops in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
MAFF and the Forestry Commission have funded research into the agronomy, production and environmental effects of energy crops, and the industry is funding work on the development of higher-yielding varieties. It is expected that yields will increase and development costs will fall substantially as commercial-scale plantings increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An area of 100,000 to 150,000 hectares in the UK as a whole would be needed to make a real contribution to targets, which would be a significant expansion from the current planting of about 1,000 hectares. That compares with about 18.4 million hectares of agricultural land in Britain and Northern Ireland, of which about 586,000 hectares were in set aside last year. Estimates suggest that the planned funding under the rural development plan for England would enable about 22,000 hectares of energy crops to be planted by 2006. That would be a positive step towards the target. What contribution can we expect to see from Northern Ireland in respect of that target?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key benefit of energy crops is that the energy that is expended in growing them—on their planting, the herbicides that are used, and the harvesting and drying of the crop—is much less than that which is released when they are burnt. The rest of the energy that is taken in comes from the sun during their growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Energy crops have many other benefits. They provide a new commercial opportunity for farmers. Given the economic difficulties that are faced by the agricultural sector in Northern Ireland, that is important. Energy crops are likely to be particularly
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0601">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>25</span>
well suited to land currently used for livestock production. They also help to spread on-farm work demands throughout the year, some work being needed on the crop in the winter months. Benefits beyond agriculture include the creation of jobs in rural areas, as I said earlier. Estimates vary, but it is generally accepted that five jobs are created for each megawatt of electricity generated. Project ARBRE, which is being developed by Yorkshire Water in the UK, will generate 8 MW of electricity and create at least 40 jobs. Therefore, the potential exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my right hon. Friend the Minister made clear in his written answer to a question that I asked him on 9 March, the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland has undertaken extensive research into energy crop production and its potential in Northern Ireland since the 1970s and has built up a wealth of expertise in this area. Several recent reports into the economics of production of short-rotation coppice on non-arable land have shown the need for short-term agricultural subsidies. The adoption of a system similar to that proposed under the rural development plan for England—a MAFF consultation document on the energy crops scheme has been published—would help to promote energy crops as a new form of agriculture. I look forward to hearing from my right hon. Friend the Minister what support mechanisms can be introduced in Northern Ireland. Such developments must progress with similar initiatives for capital grant support for investment in the generation capacity for small-scale wood-fuel combined heat and power installations. I look forward to hearing in a little more detail what potential exists there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is also worth making it clear that significant energy crop enterprises already exist outside Northern Ireland. Development programmes are under way in the UK, in mainland Europe and in north America. For example, in Sweden some 16,000 hectares of willow have been established, promoting wood chips for fuel at a price competitive with other sources. Short-rotation willow coppice development is now well established. As I said, much of the early work was done in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland takes the lead in the UK's development and demonstration of small-scale gasification technology to convert the wood chips to electricity and heat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
According to a document that I received from Northern Ireland Electricity, the scale of operation is seen as particularly appropriate to the farm structure in Northern Ireland. A gasification plant linked to a 90 kW gas engine electricity generator and a central heating system has been installed at the college of agriculture in Enniskillen and has been used since 1993 to gain direct operational experience of converting willow coppice to electricity and heat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under Northern Ireland's second non-fossil fuel order two small heat and power projects were granted contracts. A unit was installed at the Brook Hall estate in Londonderry on a large arable farm, where 100 kW of electricity are being generated through a gasifier, engine and generator, fuelled with willow coppice, which has been grown on the farm. A 200 kW electricity generator has been installed at the Blackwater Valley museum in County Armagh,
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
fuelled by forest residues, again using a gasification process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To show how much involvement Northern Ireland has in that process, one of the first duties that I performed when I was the Minister responsible for the economy was to open the first of the willow coppice schemes in Londonderry on John Gilliland's estate.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thomas</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for making clear his long-standing interest in energy crops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With those two NFFO projects up and running in Northern Ireland, demonstrating the potential of wood in generating heat and power, it is now time to exploit the technology more widely. As I have said, the benefits of taking the technology forward and expanding the use of energy crops would help to promote greater diversification of the energy base in Northern Ireland, improving the security of energy supply. They help to realise new benefits in rural economic development; they help to promote the diversification of agriculture from food production into other locally sustainable farm production; they help to reduce CO	<div class='sub'>2</div> <!-- sub --> emissions and deliver other local environmental benefits; and they help to promote an improvement in industrial competitiveness arising from the exploitation of the local technological development in renewable conversion equipment that has taken place. I hope that my right hon. Friend can offer some hope that there will be a further roll-out of support to develop this one specific project in which I have a particular interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>4.9 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Hunter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Basingstoke)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be brief and selective. I was a member of the Select Committee that recently reported on the livestock industry and I note that the Minister referred to many aspects of that report in his opening comments. Obviously he could not make, and nor did he attempt to make a full comment on it. There are two points that he chose not to mention and I should like to bring them to his attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first concerns food labelling. Much of the evidence that the Committee received emphasised the high quality of Northern Ireland agricultural produce. It was suggested that clear, unequivocal labelling of Northern Ireland as a source of produce would promote increased demand. As I recall, the Ulster Farmers' Union made that point to us as did Lord Dubs. He was, however, speaking in a personal capacity, as he was not a Minister when he came to our Committee. What is the Government's thinking here?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Government believe that there is some mileage in more clearly labelling Northern Ireland as the source of produce, there would have to be some tidying up, both of the European Union directive and national legislation. The Committee welcomed the voluntary informal, non-statutory guidelines that MAFF produced on 1 February, but our reaction was that it did not go far enough and that a statutory
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>27</span>
scheme was required and that that would follow only after consultation with the Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second question concerns the pig sector. The Minister spoke about that at length and it is arguably the sector that causes the greatest concern. The downturn has been greater than was anticipated and we all note the consequences. The Committee concluded that greater support for the pig sector was both justified and necessary but acknowledged the difficulties of achieving that, partly because of the light EU pigmeat regime and partly because of the state aid rules. I echo the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) urging the Government to look again constructively at this whole area to see whether, within the rules and regulations of the EU, there are means whereby even more support can come to the pig sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What surprised and somewhat angered the Committee was that the Government of the Republic of Ireland found a small scheme that was consistent with EU regulation. It found that scheme and based it on the fire at the pigmeat processing plant at Ballymoney. What strikes me as unacceptable is that the Government of the Republic discovered that they could help their pig farmers through that, and not the British Government. One feels that that scheme should be made available to pig farmers in the north, just as it is in the south. Those are my two points. What do the Government think about food labelling and will they have a further look at support for the pig sector, in particular, copying the scheme that exists in the Republic as a result of the fire at Ballymoney?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I congratulate my hon. Friends the Members for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) and East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) on their contributions to this important debate. My hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim is also a member of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which produced the report on the livestock industry that has been referred to during the debate. I mention him because, unless I am mistaken from my perusal of the report, he had the honour of attending every meeting of the Committee on the subject. I notice that the hon. Members representing the Democratic Unionist party and the Social Democratic and Labour party on the Committee each managed to attend only two meetings of the Committee on that important issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to the obvious fact that I hope will not have escaped the attention of the gentleman present representing the Northern Ireland media. Agriculture is a major industry in Northern Ireland. Many hon. Members have referred to the way in which it produces about 10 per cent. of employment and contributes significantly to the social fabric. However, the only Northern Ireland party represented in the debate on that important subject is the Ulster Unionist party. The other three Northern Ireland parties represented in the House have shown their interest for the biggest industry in Northern Ireland by not bothering even to turn up to register an attendance, let
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
alone to contribute. The media at home in Northern Ireland will note that fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The final words of my right hon. Friend were effective. He was referring to the industry as a whole. I hear the industry say from time to time that the Ulster Unionists do not look after agricultural affairs. I also pay tribute to the mainland members of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, who have done a fantastic job.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to my right hon. Friend's final point, as a city Member, I have been concerned about the problems affecting the shipyard. Far more people are affected by the agriculture industry than are affected by the shipyard. The industry is therefore vital. While not minimising the importance of the shipyard—as I say, I am speaking as a city Member—it is important that we recognise the importance of agriculture.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his well-made and valid points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
References have been made to the recent UK farm summit and the measures announced then. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone justly commented, we must be grateful for small mercies. Unfortunately, they were small. In case Government Members forget, we must note that, although some measures were brought forward involving the United Kingdom finally taking up some of the European Union agrimonetary funding, only one third of the money available was taken up. The question must be put to the Government why only one third of the money was taken up. Is there not a significant need? Why should that need not be addressed? I hope that the Minister will respond on that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why did the Government not provide any of the agrimonetary compensation available in 2000 for the arable sector? Why did they not provide all the agrimonetary compensation available in 2000 for the beef and sheep sectors? Do the Government intend to provide the agrimonetary compensation available for those sectors in 2001 and 2002? We would welcome responses to those questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the efforts being made to achieve BSE low incidence status for Northern Ireland. Other hon. Members contributing to the discussion of the subject have noted the simple fact that Northern Ireland has the lowest incidence of BSE of any region of the United Kingdom and a lower incidence than most areas of Europe. If one considers the obduracy of the French Government on the matter, it might seem ironic that Northern Ireland has a lower incidence of BSE than France, yet the French are imposing difficulties with regard to Northern Ireland beef. We want something to happen on that matter, too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the reason why one refers with disappointment to the small sum that has been released as a result of the farm summit is the background situation in Northern Ireland. We are facing a year in which incomes have dropped sharply. Indeed, it is estimated that the average farmer will have no income in the current financial year. The problems described by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire are the same elsewhere, and it is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>29</span>
estimated that many farmers will have negative income.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, there are the very substantial debts that have been mentioned The banks are owed more than £500 million and suppliers—especially grain suppliers—are owed at least half that amount again. We are discussing a fairly small industry, but some farmers carry a tremendous amount of debt. Such debt is a problem not only for farmers, but for suppliers and maybe even for the banks. I was recently told that 20 per cent. of the loans made by one major bank in Northern Ireland are secured on agricultural land, whose prices in Northern Ireland are artificially high and have been so for some time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is obvious that we are sitting on a time bomb. As yet, none of the suppliers or banks have moved to try to recover debts from farms. As things currently stand, there is very little prospect of the farmers being able to repay. If they are facing the likelihood of having no income this year, there is very little prospect of them being able to cover their interest payments even with the money that the Government have put in, let alone of starting to get back into the capital. Sooner or later something will have to be done or something will happen. Surely there should be considerable concern that if the Government do nothing, a significant number of farmers will go out of business. We may even see a collapse in land values in agricultural areas, which will cause enormous difficulties for suppliers and potentially for banks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter cannot be ignored and requires urgent consideration. The Minister will know that my colleague in the Assembly and others have suggested that the Government should tackle the problems and consider the possibility of providing soft or low-interest loans. I know that there are difficulties in providing state aids, but I feel that the Government should be tackling the problem more energetically. It should be possible to construct schemes that can tackle the issue without running into the difficulties encountered in providing state aids. There is not just a need for a short-term boost, which is what the money from the UK farms summit clearly is. We need to go much further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has touched on that need to go further and look further into the future. He referred to the study initiated during the period of devolution by the local agriculture Minister, when proposals were made for the establishment of a task force to try to develop a strategic vision for the future of Northern Ireland's agri-food industry. I am glad to hear that the Minister has said that he will meet officials to make progress on that study, perhaps next week. That is better than letting it gather dust, as it apparently has done since 11 February, and I am glad that it is happening, as such an operation is very necessary. We welcomed during the time of the devolved Administration the fact that attempts were being made to try to think strategically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to mention a couple of issues with which the Minister may already be familiar and I hope that he will forgive me for doing so. The study should address the restructuring of agriculture and the lowering of the age profile of farmers. A very high
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
proportion of farmers and people engaged in agriculture are over 50 and very few young people are coming into the business. That age profile is not very good and something should be done about it. Retirement schemes have been mentioned and an unfortunate comparison can of course be made with the Republic of Ireland, which has schemes that do not exist in Northern Ireland. Certainly, something must be done to address the age profile in Northern Ireland agriculture.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another issue that must be considered is the more equitable distribution of food-chain revenue, including the central theme of improved producer marketing. That is obviously an important matter. We also want to see the introduction of a more comprehensive agri-environmental policy, which would provide proper rewards to farmers for the provision of social goods. There is a general problem about who is to look after the countryside. One cannot just simply let the industry fade out, as the Government or society might perhaps do in respect of other forms of industry. That is not a viable option in relation to the countryside.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned that he looked on rural development as an important matter and referred to it as the second pillar of the common agricultural policy. I hope that will be followed up with more funding for rural development and improved farmer access, which raises questions about the planning regime. That must be carefully considered because planning policies operate in a way that inhibits some rural development. We cannot think about diversifying rural development while we have too many inefficiencies in a planning system that itself requires a complete overhaul.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another important issue is the difference in the cost base in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. That requires examination of production and administration costs, because there is clearly inequality. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire referred to the difficulties that we have suffered as a result of the fall in the value of the euro. That is the correct way to view the issue because the problem is not the rise of sterling, which has remained level compared with the dollar and many other currencies. The problem arises largely from the comparative collapse of the euro, which has created a significant difficulty for us and for agricultural products generally. The Republic of Ireland has a much lower cost base partly because safety and health standards are lower. As I am sure the Minister knows from the recent negotiations on cross-border co-operation, that is part of the reason why we were so keen for a cross-border body to examine food safety and food health issues. We were disappointed that the Irish Government would agree only to a narrow margin of co-operation. We were in favour of co-operation on a wider basis because we want to create a level playing field with regard to standards, which would probably mean levelling up rather than down. It is important that there should be a level playing field. The fact that the cost base in the Republic of Ireland is lower because of lower standards in some areas is a serious
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
problem for us, but it is also something that the EU should consider.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention two other issues relating to the longer-term vision for the future of agriculture in Northern Ireland. First, on education and training, more should be done for those who are involved in agriculture. There should be more information for farmers, more education and more training. Allied to that, the establishment of effective and comprehensive research and development in the industry is extremely important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In his opening remarks, the Minister said that the agri-food sector has a future, but he then went on to say that that future would be realised only on the basis of dynamic change. Will the Minister elaborate on that comment? In the devolved Administration, we were trying to create a vision for the future of Northern Ireland's agri-food industry, which would require the evolution of policies, in so far as the devolved Administration could evolve policies. I suggest to the Minister that his Government need to evolve a similar strategy for agriculture in the United Kingdom as a whole because there is a fear in many sectors that the Government's policy—this might explain why they were so slow to act and did so little when they did act—is to cause a major shake-out in agriculture in the United Kingdom and a restructuring down to a more limited base. I hope that the Government will spell out their policies more clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a feeling in the industry—not only in Northern Ireland, but elsewhere in the United Kingdom as well—that the Government do not care about agriculture and the countryside to the extent that they ought to. The Government need to address the issue. Agriculture is not like those sectors of manufacturing industry that can be allowed to close down as people switch from one form of industrial or manufacturing activity to another. The countryside will still be there, and we will have to consider what to do about it. That is particularly important in places such as Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The move towards a more competitive, market-orientated industry, as foreshadowed in the Minister's comments, will provide for the continuation of some form of agricultural industry in parts of England, perhaps, but there will be a problem in more remote areas. The Government should evolve policies that will keep people in the countryside and allow some forms of viable economic activity to take place in those areas. We cannot look forward with equanimity to a situation that would involve significant depopulation of rural areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I shall not speak for long, but I feel that I owe a brief word of explanation to the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas) and, perhaps, to the

Although, as every Member of the House knows, I am an expert on absolutely nothing, I have managed, squirrel-like, to pick up a few things from time to time. One of those things came to me from my service on the Select Committee on the Environment during my first spell in Parliament between 1983 and 1987.

We considered the proposition that fresh water sources often originate as rainwater run-off in wooded uplands. If downstream acidification is found in the fresh water, there are only two possible explanations. One is that the rain was acidic in the first place, hence acid rain. The other is that the rain was not acidic, but the water has run over acidic ground in the course of its downward progress. It has been suggested—I promise that this diversion will not take a moment, Mr. McWilliam—that intensive cropping of timber acidifies the ground where the trees are grown. That is because, in the case of conifers certainly, the tree itself becomes alkaline. It abstracts its alkalinity from the soil and, thus, renders the soil correspondingly acidic. In nature, that does not matter, because, in the end, the trees, like human beings, die. The tree falls to the ground and returns its alkalinity. However, if the trees are cropped and taken away, the alkali is removed, but the acid remains.

Farming throughout the United Kingdom is in the midst of a severe crisis. Between 1997 and 1999, farm incomes collapsed by three quarters, and the situation is even more severe in Ulster. The 	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> reported recently that the Province's largest industry is experiencing its worst financial crisis in living memory. The Ulster Farmers Union provided the following summary of the state of Northern Ireland's agriculture industry:
	<br><q><p>The agri-food industry is still Northern Ireland's largest, single industry accounting for 10 per cent. of civil employment and 7.5 per cent. of Gross Domestic Product. The agri-food industry in Ulster is almost three times as important as at UK level. The agri-food industry is still the major driving force in the rural economy in Northern Ireland. £756 million has been removed from the Province's economy over the last five years as a result of the agricultural crisis. Annual total farm income has plummeted by 79 per cent. in real terms to £71 million in that period. Provisional figures for 1999–00 indicate average net farm income to be minus
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
£700. Hill farming incomes in Northern Ireland plummeted by 95 per cent. in 1998–99 to average £200-farm-annum. Negative incomes are forecast for 1999–2000. Farm incomes in Northern Ireland fell 23 per cent. in real terms in 1999 compared to a 1 per cent. real terms reduction in the United Kingdom as a whole.</p></q>
That is a severe comparison.
	<br><q><p>Northern Ireland's farmers now owe over £520 million to banks alone and this continues to grow.</p></q>
In its excellent second report, the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs stated:
	<br><q><p>The recent rate of decline in Northern Ireland has been disproportionately greater than elsewhere in the United Kingdom and, in 1998, Total Income from Farming in Northern Ireland fell to its lowest level in real terms for at least 18 years.</p></q>
The Committee listed several reasons why Ulster farming has suffered even more than mainland farming.
	<br><q><p>The main reason for the bigger income decline in Northern Ireland in 1998 was the relatively greater dependence on cattle and the steeper fall in the price of cattle in the Province. There were also smaller contributions in some sectors from specific local factors, such as the loss of 40 per cent. of the Province's pig processing capacity with the fire at the Lovell and Christmas processing plant at Ballymoney in June 1998 … The fall in income in 1999 is mainly attributable to unfavourable weather conditions in the winter of 1998–99, which led to depleted stocks of fodder and a need for increased purchases of feedstuffs and fertilisers. Northern Ireland agriculture relies on exporting a large part of its production in most sectors, both to Great Britain and elsewhere. The relative strength of sterling—</p></q>
or, as the Ulster Unionist leader, the right hon. Member for Upper Bann said, the relative weakness of the euro—
	<br><q><p>is therefore of considerable significance.</p></q>
The Committee also referred to the economic effects of the land border, which is unique in the United Kingdom. The issue of fuel illustrates the problems. The Committee's third report for the 1998–99 session considered the impact of crossborder fuel price differentials in Northern Ireland. The then Treasury Minister, the hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt), told the Committee that it was assessed from the Customs end that the revenue lost through both cross-border shopping, which is legal, and smuggling, which is not, was about £100 million in 1998. The Committee thought that that estimate was conservative, and that the losses were greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have one eye on the clock, but I will make a point about food labelling. The Committee's second report examined that topic particularly in relation to countries of origin, and it said:
	<br><q><p>A considerable amount of the evidence stressed the very high quality of Northern Ireland agricultural produce and it was suggested that this might be capitalised on through labelling of Northern Ireland products by their source.</p></q></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Pound</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that that was discussed at great length in Committee, and the idea of a product of Northern Ireland stamp, illustrated with a pony, was mentioned? A pony would not necessarily commend it to me, as opposed to a meat pie, although in some cultures, such as France, it would be popular.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Union jack was also suggested. Again, that probably would not be too popular. Reference was made to the National Consumer Council report of July 1999, which stated that, although 29 per cent. of
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
consumers in Northern Ireland would like to eat food sourced within Northern Ireland, the vast majority said that the important factors were price, location and value for money. Were we to extend too many resources on that issue, we could be knocking our heads against a brick wall.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, and that was arguably the experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien). On Friday 3 March, he introduced his private Member's Bill on food labelling for Second Reading. Despite the Bill's consistency with Government statements on that issue, Government Members blocked the Bill. I think that was perhaps the brick wall to which the hon. Member for Ealing, North alluded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will shortly conclude, but I want to comment on the farm aid package that was announced at the Downing street farm summit on 30 March. The Government announced a £200 million aid package for farmers. The Committee's atmosphere this afternoon has been congenial and not marked by partisanship, so I will content myself with saying that that £200 million was certainly not all new money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I will let the Ulster Farmers Union have the last word. It responded to the farm aid package with a statement, in which its president, Will Taylor, said:
	<br><q><p>Today's events will provide a short-term boost to some sections of our industry. A longer-term commitment from Government is still essential.</p></q>
It is difficult to disagree.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble), who unfortunately is not in his place at the moment, said that certain members of other parties were not present. I think that it is worth commenting on a member of his own party who is not here. As we were debating, I noticed that the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Moginnis) was participating in a debate on the Floor of the House.

I hope that in the time available I can cover all the points that have been raised. I will deal with the points that the hon. Member for West Tyrone made, which other hon. Members touched on. I agree with his overall assessment of the problems. Indeed, I defined the problems that the farming industry faces in similar terms. I share his warm reference to the report on agriculture by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank the hon. Member for West Tyrone for welcoming the package announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. In my opening comments,
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>35</span>
I omitted to say that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food put a tremendous amount of effort into bringing together that package. He worked tremendously hard with all the farming interests and the wider interests in the agri-food sector to secure what was undoubtedly a major achievement. Some hon. Members have tried to minimise the package and undermine it, but it is worth remembering that it was worth £200 million. It was in response to the issues raised by various farming interests and the agri-food sector. It was inappropriate and somewhat ungracious of the right hon. Member for Upper Bann to talk about small mercies. It was clearly produced as result of much hard negotiation. The hon. Member for West Tyrone recognised that we can only move in line with EU regulations as we try to assist the farming sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have shown that they are a listening Government. We have taken on board the depth of the argument in the farming community. As a Member of Parliament with an agricultural sector in my constituency, I recognise that other sectors are hard pressed too. The Government are seeking solutions to rectify the mess that we inherited from the previous Administration. There are matters that we have to deal with almost on a daily basis. We are trying to restructure not just the agricultural sector but other sectors too.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Tyrone asked about the pig industry and how money will be spent on that. That is currently being examined with the EU. He also referred to Her Majesty's visit to Northern Ireland yesterday, which was well received. I should like to pay tribute to staff of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development who organised the reception. They put in a tremendous amount of work, It paid off, because the various interests were able to get their points across to someone who is clearly interested in this sector of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also rightly highlighted the importance of rural development. That is an important part of what the Government are seeking to do. He made a number of other points, and referred to the planning issues that were raised in the Prime Minister's summit conclusions. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will try to emulate the planning changes in Northern Ireland as they were announced at that summit.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked about cattle ear tags. Again, the Department is looking into that. I am advised that electronic ear tags have not yet proved acceptable as the only means of identification, but we take his points on board. He also made the point that the summit package was not worth much to the average dairy farmer. I would agree that the amount per farm is relatively small, but it is the maximum amount of agrimonetary compensation available, and that sum is determined by the EU Commission. We are therefore matching the maximum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also made a point about rural development regulation and asked me to clarify the sums involved; he mentioned one sum and I quoted
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
another in my opening remarks. The total value of the rural development plan over the period 2000–2006 is £190 million and the sum I referred to is £38 million. That is the amount of match funding added by the Government under the modulation arrangements. It would perhaps help if I wrote to the hon. Gentleman to set out in greater detail how the sum is developed and structured. I am sure that he and other members of the Committee would benefit from that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Tyrone also asked about the extra fishing quota that had been given to Belgium under the cod recovery plan. A small amount of quota has been given to Belgium in recognition of its co-operation in preventing its beam trawlers from king cod in the restricted areas. I think he said that he had received assurances from the Floor of the House during MAFF questions that had resolved his worries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State gave an assurance that the Dutch and the Irish were not being given extra quota. The problem is that their beam trawlers may be able to go into the Irish box.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I do not know what was said on the Floor of the House today. Perhaps I should clarify matters in terms of the quota arrangements and the reasons behind that particular decision. I recognise the point that the hon. Member for West Tyrone made about the dispute between those who fish and those who research fish stocks. That is a never-ending debate. If the scientists have got it right, fish stocks are in a parlous state. It would be advisable to err on the side of caution, so that we can ensure the future survival of a fishing industry in that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the points raised by the hon. Member for East Antrim, and the relationship between the banks and the farming sector. On accepting responsibility for agriculture—albeit, I hope, temporarily—I decided that banks should be told on a phased basis when moneys will be made available from central Government, so that they will know that cash is coming in in a month's or two months' time. I intend to proceed with the measure, which, I hope, will ease the pressure on many individual farmers. As banks put money back into the farming sector, they will be fully aware of what the Government are doing, and need not foreclose on farmers when money may in fact be coming in over a period of time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A number of points were also raised about when changes to the over-30 months scheme will take effect. Discussions are currently under way, and I am advised that they are likely to take effect from 1 June. The hon. Member for East Antrim referred to DIY horse foot trimmers, and asked the Department to review and approve related schemes. Again, I have taken on board the points that he raised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also asked whether agrimonetary compensation will always be paid by the UK—a much more fundamental question. The answer is, not necessarily, because there are very significant financial implications in that regard. In spending public money, the Government must take account of the various priorities imposed on them. Hon. Members want money to be spent in a variety of ways, and the Government have to make qualitative

judgments on its disbursal. I would be wrong to say that there is an open-ended commitment in this regard.

The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said that he had to leave the Committee, and he is no longer in his place. Instead of discussing the detailed points that he raised, I shall write to him. He referred to low-incidence BSE status, and I welcome his endorsement of the Government's efforts to further the unique position in which Northern Ireland finds itself I can assure him that we are actively engaged with the EU Commission and taking best advice on the way forward. MEPs from Northern Ireland are, of course, aware of our intentions in this regard. At the appropriate time, they will be able to play am important part in ensuring that impact is maximised.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should reiterate the point that there will be losers as well as gainers. As the programme develops, certain problems may manifest themselves, and we should bear that in mind as we move forward. We must not think that this is an easy solution; it is the best solution, but difficulties may arise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas) made an erudite contribution, which provoked an interesting and thoughtful exchange between him and the hon. Member for Solihull. Mr. Taylor. I could give him a long answer or a short one, but in view of the time it will be the short answer. I said in my own intervention that as a Minister I had already been engaged in that development. I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Government consider that the energy crop and particularly the use of short-rotation willow coppice have potential as a source of renewable energy, but there are difficulties because of the shortage of available land for such schemes. Our rural development regulation plan, which is currently awaiting European Commission approval, provides for the payment of grants for the afforestation of agricultural land, including the planting of willow for short-rotation coppice use. The planting grant rates are about £600 per hectare on non-set-aside land and £400 per hectare on set-aside land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, I shall take on board all the points that have been made. Hon. Members have made some positive comments about the research activity that has been undertaken in Northern Ireland, and the schemes have been put in place to show the efficacy of using energy crops in this way. Again, we shall take on board the representations that have been made in the debate.

The hon. Members for Basingstoke (Mr. Hunter) and for Solihull mentioned the Select Committee report. All members of the Committee today have complimented the Select Committee on it. I shall not respond in detail on the elements contained in it, other than to say that it is being actively considered by the Department and we shall respond in due course. As hon. Members recognised, many of its recommendations have been overtaken by the Prime Ministers' summit of 30 March. However, I want to make some comments on the pig sector, and it is worth reminding the Committee of the failure of previous Administrations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the problem, which I referred to obliquely in my opening comments in relation to the pig offal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
sector, is that the previous Tory Government could have put in place mechanisms to assist the pig sector. They did not do so. They may not have refused; it may simply have been a matter of incompetence. As a result, we cannot now help that sector. Therefore, it is wrong and unfair to land this responsibility on the present Government. The previous Administration precipitated the problem by not giving assistance to the pig sector. I shall not go into detail on the background of BSE, because, again, that problem was not made manifest by this Administration but was the result of the previous Tory Administration's inaction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the limited time that remains will the Minister tell us how many years he wants to be in office and how many Budgets he wants his Government to bring in before he begins to realise that he is the author of current affairs?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I spent a considerable number of years in Opposition, and probably about 10 years into the previous Government's period of office they were still complaining about the previous Labour Administration's actions. I do not make this comment without thought, but I make it particularly in relation to the issues raised in the debate. I only say to the hon. Member for Solihull that, when Conservative Members ask for something from this Government, they should do their research and find out why it has not been done, because the issue in relation to BSE and the pig sector is solely the responsibility of the previous Administration. Let us not forget the history of this problem or allocate blame unjustly. Before I close, I want to comment on some of the earlier points made by the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble). He made a passing reference to the fact that the statutory plan was gathering dust. That is not the case. When the Administration was suspended, the industry, following consultation, said, "Let us not proceed in the meantime, in the hope that the Assembly will be reinstated". As it seemed that that would not happen in the immediate short term, at the back of the summer I decided to reinstate that strategy. Therefore, it was wrong to say that the plan was gathering dust.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that I am rapidly running out of time, but I want to make one final point about the dynamic change that I referred to. If the industry does not recognise that change is coming to the producers, consumers and to its own sector, it will find it difficult to develop in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All of us in the House want to see genuine peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, but that can only be achieved if the truth about what has happened in the past 30 years of terrorist violence can be told. I warmly welcome the decision by Her Majesty the Queen to award the brave men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary the George Cross, but many questions remain to be answered about why so many officers were murdered and why their killers and, in many cases, those who set them up, remain free today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of my colleagues will be aware of the many disturbing revelations made in a recent book called "Bandit Country" by Toby Harnden. I recommend anyone to read that book who is misty-eyed about the nature of terrorist violence, or indeed about the nature of the Sinn Fein-IRA leaders whom the Prime Minister and others are so keen to bring into Government in our country. It does not make comfortable reading.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I lost two of my cousins to the murderous south Armagh brigade of the IRA. Constable Samuel Donaldson, a young community policeman, was blown up in 1970 as he investigated a report of a stolen car. His brother, Chief Inspector Alex Donaldson, was killed along with eight of his colleagues in Newry police station in 1985. We hear a lot about the human rights of the terrorists. What about the human rights of my cousins, who were decent law-abiding citizens with a strong Christian faith? They were murdered trying to protect the ordinary people—both Protestant and Roman Catholic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having conducted my own extensive inquiries since the book was published, I believe that there is an overwhelming case for an independent public inquiry into the reasons why Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Bob Buchanan, two of the most senior RUC officers to die during the troubles, were murdered near Jonesborough as they returned from a meeting with the Irish police in Dundalk on 20 March 1989. Superintendent Buchanan lived at Moira in my constituency. The meeting that he and Chief Superintendent Breen attended was arranged only on the morning of the day in question, and took place at 2 pm. How did the IRA know about a meeting involving such senior officers, and the timing of their return to Northern Ireland?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In particular, an independent public inquiry should examine the evidence that Eoin Corrigan, a retired Detective Sergeant now living in Drogheda, passed information to the IRA. On the morning on which he died, Chief Superintendent Breen expressed concern about Sergeant Corrigan's known IRA sympathies. Why was action not taken by the Irish police to prevent sensitive information from falling into his hands? Mr. Harnden's book alleges that the RUC had
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
technical information gleaned—one presumes, from the watchtowers in south Armagh—that proves that the IRA was contacted from within Dundalk Garda station on the day on which Chief Superintendent Breen and Superintendent Buchanan were murdered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are questions that need to be answered about how the IRA attained the information that enabled them to murder those two senior police officers. Several other murders in south Armagh could also have involved collusion between Garda officers and the IRA. For example, Lord Chief Justice Gibson and Lady Gibson were murdered by the IRA on 25 April 1987. Their bodies were burned beyond recognition. Lord Chief Justice Gibson was the second most senior judge in Northern Ireland at the time of his murder, and he and Lady Cecily lived at Drumbo, in my constituency. The attack occurred at 8.30 am. Lord and Lady Gibson had just left their Garda escort and were about to pick up their RUC escort when the bomb exploded. The precision required to detonate that bomb at just that time again raises the question of possible collusion between rogue elements in the Garda and the Provisional IRA. How did the IRA come into possession of information that enabled it to track the movements of Lord and Lady Gibson and explode the land mine that killed them both?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The following year, on 23 July 1988, Robert and Maureen Hanna and their six-year-old son David, who lived at Hillsborough in my constituency, were murdered when an IRA land mine exploded under their vehicle at Killeen in South Armagh, at about the same spot where the Gibson murders took place. The 1000 lb bomb had apparently been intended for High Court Judge Eoin Higgins. In a statement issued afterwards, the IRA said:
	<br><q><p>The wrong description was passed on to volunteers who monitored the Hannas vehicle which, by sheer coincidence, it now appears, was immediately preceded the length of the journey by an unrelated, unmarked Garda car.</p></q>
The reference to the Garda car is extremely interesting. Who told the IRA about Judge Higgins's movements? Who gave the IRA erroneous information? Was it merely coincidence that an unmarked Garda car drove all the way from Dublin airport to the border, in front of the Hanna's vehicle? Could it be that a Garda source was driving that unmarked car and had made a mistake in identifying the Hanna's vehicle as that of Judge Higgins? Why would an unmarked Garda car drive all the way from Dublin airport to the border in that manner without an obvious purpose? Did Sergeant Corrigan have access to information relating to Judge Higgins's movements? An independent inquiry could explore such questions, which need to be answered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other examples of collusion between Irish police officers and the IRA could be cited, some of which are detailed in "Bandit Country". The special criminal court in Dublin is currently considering a case involving Sergeant Finbar Hickey, who has been charged with false possession of passports, and a man called Fox, who is allegedly a senior member of the Provisional IRA and was previously charged with the murder of Post Office worker Frank Kerr in Newry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>41</span>
The evidence in that case suggests that Sergeant Hickey was involved in providing the Provisional IRA with false passports for use in its illegal activities. The public are entitled to know the truth about Sergeant Hickey's involvement with the IRA and who else in the Garda was associated with his activities. Although the court case will go some way towards tackling those issues, the wider implications can be fully investigated only by an independent public inquiry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about the occasions on which the Irish police have obstructed the course of justice in Northern Ireland? In 1979, Detective Chief Inspector Eric Anderson reported that the Irish authorities would not even provide a forensic report to help with an inquiry into the murder of 18 soldiers, the murders having been executed from the territory of the Irish Republic. I refer to the murder of 18 members of the Parachute Regiment, who died at Narrow Water near Warrenpoint as a result of two bombs detonated by the Provisional IRA? What about the destruction of evidence by the Irish police, which was a factor in preventing Joseph Anthony Brennan from being charged with those murders in 1994?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I accept that, in recent months, the Irish police have done some sterling work in limiting the activities of the so-called Real IRA. But what about the succour and comfort that some of its members gave to the Provisional IRA throughout the preceding years? One IRA member told Mr. Harnden, during his interviews when collating his book, that Irish police officers would apologise when arresting him. An RUC officer noted that the border was always an open door for the escaping IRA man, but that it suddenly became an iron curtain during the bovine spongiform encephalopathy crisis. Were the Irish authorities more concerned with clamping down on cattle than terrorists? We should be told.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unlike the Republican movement that has used allegations of collusion against members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to denigrate the entire force, I am not seeking to denigrate the Irish police as a whole. I recognise the efforts that have been made by the Gardai in the fight against terrorism. While I have occasionally criticised that effort, I have acknowledged the more recent improvements in cross-border security co-operation between the RUC and the Gardai. However, an independent public inquiry would afford the Gardai the opportunity to identify the rogues, and thus restore their reputation and professional integrity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I say again that I sincerely desire real peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, not least as a tribute to the memory of my two cousins, my constituents and all the other innocent people who have been murdered so brutally in the past three decades. The Prime Minister employed the same reasoning when he ordered an inquiry into the events of so-called Bloody Sunday in 1972. For that reason I respectfully request that a public inquiry be held into the murders of Chief Superintendent Breen and Superintendent Buchanan and the many other crimes in South Armagh, and that the allegations of collusion between elements in the Irish police and the Provisional IRA are investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>42</span>
Given that the Government have conceded to demands from the Irish Government for an inquiry into the events on Bloody Sunday, will the Minister now ensure that the Government will co-operate with the Irish Government and hold an inquiry into terrorist-related deaths in South Armagh since 1970? The public are entitled to know the truth. If we can spend millions of pounds on an inquiry into events that took place in Londonderry in 1972, surely it is right that the truth be sought in respect of the murders to which I referred earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not talking about any old murder. I am talking about the murder of two very senior police officers. I am talking about the murder of the second most senior judge in Northern Ireland. I am also talking about the murder of three members of the Hanna family. How was the IRA able so effectively to attack our police system by murdering Chief Superintendent Breen and Superintendent Buchanan? The murder of Chief Superintendent Breen, who was in charge of counter terrorism in the whole area of South Armagh, was a major success in the IRA's campaign against the RUC and the rule of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The murder of Lord Justice Gibson and his wife was a serious blow against the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. If there is evidence of collusion between members of the Irish police and the IRA in the execution of those murders, that is a serious matter that must be addressed. It goes to the heart of law and order and justice and fairness in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that the Minister can give us a positive answer today and that he will not sweep the issues under the carpet or say, yet again, "Provide me with the evidence". The evidence is there. I have today provided him with names and with evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.14 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully recognise the reasons why the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) chose this important theme for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Minister for both security and victims, the theme of the debate goes to the heart of my responsibilities and touches on issues that are essential for longer-term peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. It is particularly timely for the debate to be held the day after Her Majesty awarded the George Cross to the RUC; I know that the hon. Gentleman joins in all the tributes that that body has received following its signal honour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Over its history, the RUC has borne the brunt of a sustained and brutal terrorist assault. The hon. Gentleman referred in his opening remarks to specific examples of that. The RUC has responded with gallantry and professionalism to those assaults, and richly deserves its accolades. Nowhere were the RUC and other security forces under greater assault than in the south Armagh area. The figures speak for themselves. There have been a total of 398 murders in the Newry and Armagh sub-divisions alone. Those two sub-divisions, out of a total of 38, are responsible for more than 10 per cent. of all terrorist murders over the past three decades; only 21 per cent. of republican and 43 per cent. of loyalist murders there have been
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>43</span>
cleared—even lower than the figures of 28 per cent. and 49 per cent. for Northern Ireland as a whole. In some ways, those figures understate the problem. Terrorists from south Armagh have been responsible for attacks not only in their own area but throughout Northern Ireland and, indeed, Great Britain. The Canary Wharf atrocity in 1996 was only the most recent example of a major terrorist attack planned by and originating in the south Armagh area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Most regrettable of all has been the consistent difficulty in obtaining convictions for terrorist murders carried out in the area. A lack of co-operation from parts of the local community and the problems faced by the security forces in operating safely there have enabled the terrorists to get away far too often. Terrorists from south Armagh have been well organised and extremely careful at all times not to risk their own lives. No one should glamorise their role; it has not, by any normal definition, been a war. It has been a dirty, cowardly and sectarian campaign. The names of Kingsmills and Darkley, with the other graphic examples given by the hon. Gentleman, will go down in infamy, even among the catalogue of horrors that have scarred Northern Ireland over the past 30 years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Minister for victims, I am all too often confronted with the consequences of that violence. The recent years of imperfect peace have not washed the suffering away; indeed, in some cases, the grief only increases with the passing of time. The hon. Gentleman earlier expressed some of that grief from his own family's experience. Nowhere is that more so than when terrorist crimes remain unsolved. I appreciate the frustration that relatives feel in such cases. I can assure them, and everyone who raises the issue on their behalf, that the RUC never ceases to pursue such cases, even when the position might from the outside seem hopeless. The determination of the RUC in that regard can be highlighted by two good examples. When the south Armagh sniper team was apprehended in 1997, the resulting trial led to the resolution of murders dating back to the 1970s, as did the recent trial of a man charged with the killing of retired PC Cyril Stewart in Armagh in March 1998. The files on terrorist killings remain open. We remain as determined as ever to catch the killers and bring them before the courts. Justice for the victims requires no less.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often heard it suggested that pursuing those responsible for the terrible crimes committed in south Armagh is made pointless by the early release programme under the Sentences Act. I fully understand the difficulty that many people have with the early release programme. Those difficulties were shared by most of the parties negotiating the Good Friday Agreement and by the people of Northern Ireland in voting on it. In a perfect world, such a proposition should not have been part of the agreement. However, the blunt truth is that if the question of prisoners had not been addressed, and acted on by the Government, the agreement would have been stillborn. That raises the question of how
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>44</span>
many more lives would have been lost from that day until now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should bear in mind what the early release scheme means in reality. It is not an amnesty. Those who are released early can be sent back to prison if they become involved in terrorist activity. Indeed, one licence has already been suspended in that way. The hon. Member for Lagan Valley suggested an inquiry into the deaths to which he referred, and I am sure that he would choose to extend it further. However, let me be clear about this. Inquiries into those murders continue. They are being carried out by the proper authorities within the jurisdiction of Northern Ireland—that is, by the RUC. The case of PC Cyril Stewart in Armagh demonstrates that the investigations continue to be pursued.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday, which is taking place in Londonderry. It has been suggested that there is a contrast between the treatment of the unsolved terrorist murders and the conduct of the Saville inquiry. However, I utterly reject any suggestion that the victims of that day in Londonderry have been given a higher status than those murdered in south Armagh. The nature of the Saville inquiry is entirely different—it is there to establish what actually happened on that Sunday. There is no doubt about what happened with regard to the terrorist murders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Just as we as a Government reject any equivalence between terrorist arms and the lawful forces of the state, so it is our duty to be especially thorough in the case of deaths caused by security forces within our jurisdiction. A higher standard will inevitably be required from those whose duty is to defend democracy as against those who seek to subvert it and achieve political aims by violence. Sometimes that is criticised as tying the security forces' hands in the fight against terrorism, but that view is mistaken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the security forces' greatest achievements is an approach to terrorism that is successful while giving primacy to the rule of law. It is no surprise that British troops and officers of the RUC are in such demand as peacekeepers and peacemakers in trouble spots such as Kosovo, Bosnia and elsewhere. Perhaps most importantly, it is that approach that has made it possible to move from a sustained terrorist campaign to the current situation of imperfect peace. The achievement of the RUC and the Army was to bring home to the terrorists the fact that they would never get their way through force and violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of all the difficulties that we currently face with regard to the political process and the continuing threat of dissident republican activity, we can sometimes lose sight of how far we have come. Over the past five years or so, the security situation in Northern Ireland has been transformed out of all recognition. We now have fewer service personnel in Northern Ireland than at any time since 1970. Border roads have been reopened and 26 bases have been closed or demolished since the ceasefires. Those changes have not been made as a sop to one side or the other. They are the direct result of an improvement in the security situation, which is obvious for all to see. Nobody wants to see the level of security that was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>45</span>
common on Northern Ireland's streets before the ceasefires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given the different threat levels, change has been able to happen more quickly in some areas than in others. For example, routine military patrolling in Belfast has ceased entirely, and the last roulement battalion left yesterday. In 1972, there were no fewer than 15 battalions on Belfast's streets. In other areas, we have not been able to make as many changes as we would like: south Armagh is the obvious example.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, even against the difficult and hostile environment of south Armagh, we have been able to reduce military activity, patrolling and helicopter levels. Yet, sadly the terrorist threat from south Armagh remains strong, with dissident republican groups particularly strongly represented on both sides of the border. Those dissident groups are determined to bomb and kill. The recent attacks on the military barracks in Ballykelly and at Ebrington demonstrate that, as does the interception of 500lbs of home-made explosives outside Hillsborough and the anti-tank weapon that was discovered near a base in Dungannon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government want the people of south Armagh to enjoy the full level of normalisation seen elsewhere in Northern Ireland. However, we cannot and will not take risks with the lives of members of the security forces or citizens of Northern Ireland and the UK in general. We shall continue to base the level of activity of the security forces strictly according to the threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised some specific issues and I have tried to respond to the matter of the jurisdiction for which we have responsibility. I know that he recognises the role played by the RUC and its unstinting efforts in bringing people to justice. I also know that he realises that terrorists will be brought to justice only if people are prepared to give evidence. We must always uphold and respect the rule of law because, if we do not and we descend to the parameters of debate set by others, we shall all be losers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he did not want to hear the usual statement that if there is evidence, it should be brought forward. I have read the book to which he referred and I assume that the RUC will examine and take account of all the information in that book to see if there is any evidence leading to a new conclusion to past investigations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The real thrust of the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) is that the Government should be asking for an inquiry into the lawful forces in the Republic because there seems to have been some dereliction of duty by some of their members. My hon. Friend has not denigrated the investigative work that has been going on in Northern Ireland, nor the work of the Army. We are simply asking the Government to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>46</span>
communicate our views to the authorities in the Republic and to ask for an inquiry into that collaboration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That goes back to the fact that many people refer to collusion between security forces and terrorist and paramilitary groups. It is an easy word to throw around, although I know that the hon. Gentlemen have not used it lightly. My response is that the due process of law should apply. I highlighted the example of one murder of which we hope the perpetrators will be brought to justice through due process and that applies elsewhere. The files never close and the close co-operation between the RUC and the Garda Siochana is at its highest level ever. That is why we have been so successful on so many occasions in frustrating the work of terrorist and paramilitary groups and in bringing to justice those who committed crimes many years ago.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I referred to the release of prisoners because there is concern about that. Even with that programme in place, it is important to pursue the perpetrators of those crimes. Who knows whether some of those people may fall within the ambit of current investigations? That is a matter for the RUC, and the courts will then determine their guilt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lagan Valley said that he had given new evidence today. That will be taken into account, but it is not for me to judge evidence. I shall take note of it and the appropriate authorities will be made aware of it. If there is new evidence, an appropriate investigation should be conducted by the RUC. In that way and through Government exchanges, we can encourage investigations elsewhere if we have evidence relating to jurisdiction there. That is the best way of handling such matters. It is important that people who carry out such crimes should be brought to justice. That is what we all want.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
