	<p>10.30 am</p>
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement about arms dumps inspections in the context of the decommissioning provisions of the Belfast agreement. [128185]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the inspection of IRA arms dumps by Mr. Ramaphosa and Mr. Ahtisaari. We believe that this step signals the sort of process of moving from talking about the arms issue to actually getting it under way. I hope and expect that the IRA will honour that undertaking. The re-establishing of contact between the IRA and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning is another sign of helpful progress. The recent IRA statement included for the first time a clear and unequivocal commitment to put arms "completely and verifiably" beyond use.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's reply, but as confidence and openness are essential ingredients in the fulfilment of the Belfast agreement, are we for ever to expect the inspections to be a sort of mysterious medieval sacrament, visible only to a high priesthood?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In one sense, that question was couched in obscure and opaque language. As I said, it is obviously a matter of making positive progress towards that which we all seek to achieve. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman hopes that the expectation that I expressed in my first response—that we shall move on from where we are now, with what was called the confidence-building measure, to the full undertakings that we believe to be consistent with the Belfast agreement—is fulfilled by those organisations, which can play an important part in achieving that objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister and I have discussed this matter in the past and we take slightly different views on it. Given the recent court case in the United States in which people were convicted for buying arms during the IRA ceasefire
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
and in which it was verified that the arms went to the IRA, although it seems strange that the IRA should want to buy more arms during a ceasefire, what tangible evidence does the Minister have for hoping—I use his word—that the IRA will honour its undertakings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have always made it clear that it is not a simple and straightforward process. Regarding the court case raised by the hon. Gentleman in the opening part of his question, we have said that all such matters are kept under scrutiny and examination. He will know that the previous Secretary of State made a determination in advance of the court's final decision of whether that information was in the public domain. That decision was tested in a court of law and the Secretary of State's finding was supported.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, we must at all times consider the process in which we are engaged, keeping alert to the possibility of failure but always building for success. It requires the involvement not only of the Government and of those who have influence over those in possession of weapons, on the republican side and the so-called loyalist side, but of all parties in Northern Ireland to move forward progressively—first to establish the peace that we all hope for and, secondly, to keep the pressure on those who have illegally held weapons.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<section>
	<div class='title'>Military Presence</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What recent discussions he has had with the Irish Prime Minister relating to the process of the reduction of military presence in Northern Ireland. [128186]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State regularly discusses the security situation in Northern Ireland with the Irish Prime Minister, whom he last met on 31 May 2000. However, all decisions with regard to normalisation of security are taken by the Chief Constable in the light of the current threat level.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In light of the turbulence surrounding Drumcree, this may not be the best moment to pursue the issue of demilitarisation. I readily acknowledge that Ministers and the Chief Constable have done a great deal, and that the arms inspectors have reported some progress. Despite those developments, will the Minister continue to press ahead with the process of demilitarisation, especially where obvious manifestations of the military presence cause local irritation? Will he confirm that the crow's nest in Crossmaglen will be demolished in the next two months?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not use the term demilitarisation; I would talk about normalisation. I would not use terminology that equates our security presence in Northern Ireland with those who are involved in paramilitarism and terrorism. As we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
consistently shown, we will move progressively forward towards a normalised environment based on the threat assessment of the Chief Constable, in consultation with the general officers commanding, and in the light of our other security advice. All those matters are kept under constant scrutiny. The current situation is very volatile, as the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) recognised in his opening question. This is a difficult time and there is a real threat, which must be addressed by those in the front line, who have a very difficult job.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In his discussions with the Irish on the question of reducing the military presence, has the Minister made it clear that significant progress cannot be made unless the question of paramilitary weapons is dealt with successfully? Further, does the Minister agree that while the inspection of weapons may be welcome as an initial confidence-building measure, it is not an end in itself? Much more significant are the discussions that will take place between the IRA's interlocutor and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. Can the Minister assure the Committee that rapid progress will be made, and has he made it clear to the Irish Government that rapid progress along that track must be made, or confidence will not be maintained? Has he also made it clear that putting weapons beyond use must comply with the definition of decommissioning; namely that the weapons must be permanently unavailable and unusable?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman has been involved in many of those discussions, and he has made his views well known to the United Kingdom and Irish Governments. He is right to say that it would be wrong to regard the recent confidence-building measure as an end to the process—that was never the way in which it was envisaged. That is why I said in response to the first question that we must engage in further steps following that. All the issues raised by the right hon. Gentleman are being impressed upon those who have weapons, through their interlocutors and other people with influence. That message should be heard loud and clear because not only the people of Northern Ireland, but all the people of the island of Ireland want to see those weapons removed for good.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that the Irish Prime Minister, the Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, has stated categorically that, in his view, the confidence-building measure, which has been implemented to some degree, is the end of the decommissioning issue? Does the Minister agree that making weaponry available to selective viewers of designated dumps, the contents of which remain entirely within the control of the IRA and represent only a fraction of the total IRA arsenal, cannot be considered to represent a commencement of the decommissioning process, whatever else it might be?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman takes a view that is diametrically opposed to that of most of us, who are trying to advance the process. He takes a firm view that all the things that we are doing are not signs of progress. However, we take a different view. Most parties and political representatives accept that progress has been made, although we accept that more must be achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Gentleman asked about the views expressed by the Taoiseach. We cannot easily resolve the fact that the Taoiseach's comments are over-interpreted by others for their own political purposes. However, the two Governments are clear in their objectives, which is why they have been working closely to try to achieve the ultimate objective of the removal of illegally held weapons and the return of a normal society to Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Post Offices (Criminal Raids)</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What steps have been taken to provide protection for post offices from criminal raids. [128187]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Royal Ulster Constabulary has recently consulted senior Post Office management on this issue. As a result of that consultation, a number of preventive measures have been put in place. The hon. Gentleman will understand that, for operational reasons, it would not be appropriate for me to make comments in any further detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's point, but does he agree that there are worrying signs? I refer especially to the release of certain folk who have been involved in terrorist activity. In my own constituency, one post office has been raided three times in the past 12 months. Latterly, a double raid occurred—one on a nationalist post office at the top of the road and another on what we would call the loyalist post office, in the middle of the road. For some obscure reason, the post office that is situated between the two was passed over. Now, people are talking, in the fashionable language of this age, about cross-community robberies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There was some humour in that question, but its thrust was different. I share the hon. Gentleman's view that any increase or other development in criminal activity within Northern Ireland is to be deplored. Clearly, it is the RUC's role to try to tackle such activities while trying to attend to what is currently a very difficult security environment. We hope to find a resolution for these security difficulties, but the matter in question is one for the operational activities of the RUC. As I have said previously, I cannot go into the detail of such operational considerations, which are a matter for the Chief Constable. I am confident that the RUC is only too well aware of the undercurrents in the way in which
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
events are described. More importantly, it is aware of the reality of the level of such criminal activity and the way in which it should be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that all hon. Members will join me in making the following plea. Tackling such activities requires people to give evidence. If people want to see an end to crime in their society, they have to co-operate with the police and with agencies of justice. Without that co-operation, it will be very difficult to achieve the hon. Gentleman's end objective.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Extradition Proceedings</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>4. 	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How many outstanding extradition proceedings there are between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. [128188]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am informed that there are currently 14 outstanding extradition proceedings between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In five of these cases no arrest has yet been made. In the remaining nine cases, the legal process is taking its course. It should be noted that not all of the cases are terrorist related.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister will agree that, even after 30 years of trying, the system is by no means satisfactory, especially in respect of those who are wanted for terrorist crimes. Individuals such as Liam Averill, about whom the Minister and I have corresponded, has not yet been arrested in the Republic of Ireland, despite the issue of six warrants for his arrest. In what position will such people be at the end of the month? When all the terrorist prisoners are out of prison in Northern Ireland, will a man such as Averill still be liable for arrest under the warrants that have been issued? If he is arrested, will he ever be returned to Northern Ireland? If he does return, will he have to finish sentences for murder, or would the murders of John McCloy and Alan Smith, who were shot to death by that man and his companions in Garvagh in 1994, simply be forgotten? Are those not questions to which people in Northern Ireland should have clear, concise answers?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The answer in one sense is yes. The clear, concise answer is that I will not debate individual cases in Committee because a court of law must be applied to the situation. The matter does not rest just with Ministers—the courts must also deal with the issues and extradition must be processed through that approach. We have said consistently that we would uphold the rule of law and that is what we seek to do in that area, as in other areas.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) was drawing attention to the difficulties with regard to extradition because of the limited grounds on which extradition is available, especially with regard to so-called political offences. Has the Minister raised with the Irish Government the desirability, since the Belfast agreement, of moving away from that limited
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
legislation, which related to difficulties that the agreement has resolved, and moving towards more broadly based extradition arrangements such as would be appropriate between friendly states?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not conscious of detailed discussions of that nature. I will seek to find an answer to the question and will write to the right hon. Gentleman in response to the specific question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the Minister's reply to the hon. Member for East Londonderry relating to the Averill case, he said that he was not willing to discuss individual cases, presumably in an allusion to the sub judice rule. However, Averill is a convicted murderer who has already gone through the legal process: he has been convicted of two murders, has been in prison and has escaped into the Republic. In no circumstances is there an objection—legal or otherwise—to dealing with the specific queries raised by my hon. Friend.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have said that I do not think it appropriate to discuss individual cases and I am surprised that the hon. and learned Gentleman should say that what he calls the sub judice rule has no relevance to such matters. It clearly has relevance. I have written to the hon. Member for East Londonderry setting out the Government's position and saying that we are seeking to ensure that one of the individuals to whom he referred is brought back to our jurisdiction. As far as we know, that person is not in our jurisdiction. We therefore need proper identification and for the proper processes to be gone through to ensure that he is returned. Those matters are for courts of law and not for politicians scoring points off each other.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<div class='title'>Punishment Beatings</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>7. 	<div class='member'>Shona McIsaac 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement on current trends in the level of punishment beatings. [128191]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From 1 January to 25 June, there were 125 paramilitary-style attacks, 61 shootings, of which 38 were by loyalists and 23 by republicans, and 64 assaults, of which 37 were by loyalists and 27 by republicans. That compares with 120 attacks in the same period last year, of which 81 were by loyalists and 49 by republicans.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Shona McIsaac</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my right hon. Friend for that answer. I was trying to do some mathematics quickly but did not manage to calculate a total. What is clear is that all members of the Committee should condemn all punishment beatings in Northern Ireland. They are simply unacceptable, regardless of which side perpetrates them. I feel, and I hope that my right hon. Friend feels, that proper policing is the solution to problems in Northern Ireland society. Those figures demonstrate the importance of the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill to getting a police organisation to deal with those dreadful attacks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0619">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is right. The matter is not simply about arithmetic, although I had to respond precisely to the question regarding current trends. One punishment attack is one too many. All those manifestations are a denial of human rights and work against the civil liberties of individuals, whether they are assaulted or driven from their community into exile. I have consistently said that every member of Northern Ireland society who wants a proper society must condemn all the attacks and all such manifestations unreservedly. I share the sentiments expressed by my hon. Friend in asking the question.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is not the reality that the scourge of paramilitarism is spreading, particularly in urban areas in Northern Ireland, as an inter-territorial battle is going on between the various paramilitary groups? Do not the Government need a clear strategy to deal with that? It is all very well condemning the attacks, as we all do, but they are a symptom of a deeper problem—the fact that paramilitarism is increasing, spreading and becoming more overt.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Questions must be brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have seen some appalling displays of paramilitarism recently. Will the Minister assure us that the Government have a strategy to deal with it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's underlying view that Northern Ireland is in a worse situation than hitherto. That is not the case. However, I agree that there are far too many examples of what he described, and that there is a tendency for internecine struggle to develop between various groups, primarily on the loyalist side. No one can condone that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman says that the Government need a strategy. They have one; it is called the rule of law. If people have evidence of the problem that the hon. Gentleman describes, and want a lawful society, they should come forward with the evidence. They should co-operate with the RUC, which is doing all that it can in difficult circumstances to deal with the problem. Far too many crimes of this nature go unsolved, not because of lack of Government effort in legislating, nor because of the way that the police conduct their business, but because of a lack of co-operation in communities with the agencies of the law. Such co-operation is one of the most effective ways of dealing with criminality and paramilitarism on the streets and in the towns of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there not something of an inconsistency between the claims of paramilitary groups that they have put arms beyond use and the continuation of intimidation, beating and exile? Would not a move to end intimidation by paramilitary groups do more than anything else to convince people that putting arms beyond use is a genuine tactic? Are there any signs that paramilitary groups are likely to end such activity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the assumptions and assertions on which the question is based, but obviously I cannot share any intelligence information about how matters are likely to progress. I make a plea for the removal of all forms of violence from Northern Ireland society. Otherwise, we shall not arrive at the normalisation of society that we all want. Those with the weapons, those who support them and those who provide tacit support, too, should hear the plea of the ordinary people of Northern Ireland and those who wish Northern Ireland well. We want a different and better society. It is time for people of good will to tackle that aim, alongside the agencies of law and order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: From the way in which the Minister is speaking it appears that the Government are treating the beatings and mutilations almost as isolated incidents, rather than as a concerted campaign of intimidation in which paramilitary groups from both sides of the loyalist-nationalist divide attempt to take over areas and towns in Northern Ireland. Will the Minister address that matter, which is of deep concern?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have addressed it, as a totality and in detail. I do not accept the basis of the question. If the hon. Gentleman has a view on how the law should be changed to ensure maximum effect, he could help by putting it forward. Does he want more draconian measures, or measures that might conflict with international standards on the protection of human rights and civil liberties? Governments in the past have tried those methods—rounding people up and interning them. They discovered that that did not solve problems but created them. It is easy to be a commentator on the problem. The Government must look for solutions and work alongside the RUC, giving it and the agents of law and order every support in pursuing the objectives that we all share.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister know that the answer to his recent question is available to him from the record and from my party's arguments over the past seven years? On the advice of the RUC, the two key things that are needed are admissibility of intercepted communications and measures along the lines of the racketeer-influenced corrupt organisations legislation. Those have been the vital elements in the defeat of racketeering in the United States. They are operating successfully in the Republic of Ireland. The Government, like their predecessor, are dragging their feet over those measures.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman recommends two simple solutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: They are not simple; they are helpful.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am conscious of the issues that have been raised. As to the use of the Interception of Communications Act 1985, discussions take place with senior police officers at the highest level and a
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0620">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
balanced judgment must be made. It is very easy to say that using the 1985 Act will solve the problem. It is not necessarily the view of experts in law and order at the sharp end that it will always achieve the objective in question. It is all very well adopting a political party policy on that question, but there are other considerations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You asked for suggestions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have asked for suggestions, but that does not mean that any suggestion that is made is automatically right. What is suggested must be set against other considerations. That is what the Government do. We ask whether an approach would achieve its objective. We do not think that what the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) argued for would do so at this stage. His party policy does not sit comfortably with the best security advice that we have.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no recordable offence of paramilitary-style attack. Offences against the person range from common assault to murder. However, from 1 June 1999 to 25 June this year, there were 123 casualties as a result of paramilitary-style assault. I also refer the hon. Member to the answer that I gave earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac).</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am very disappointed with the Minister's response. We want to know what success the RUC has had in prosecuting persons responsible for such activity. Whether the Minister wants to accept it or not, there is widespread intimidation in many estates in Northern Ireland. Paramilitary organisations are extending their influence. The attack on the community can include the breaking of windows, the mutilation of individuals, arson attacks and the driving of people from estates where they have lived for years. The fear is such that there is no confidence in the giving of evidence to the RUC. There is unwillingness to do so, because of fear of the retaliation that might follow—perhaps against other family members. There is no willingness to give evidence in court. The Minister should face up to the deteriorating state of affairs in Northern Ireland and persuade the Chief Constable to put policemen on the ground in the estates and counter the growth of lawlessness.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks for more policemen on the ground, but there are 12,500 policemen on the ground in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Put them into the areas where they are needed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If we acted as the hon. Gentleman suggested, how would we deal with the problems that
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
we now face daily as a result of the current circumstances at Drumcree? [	<i>Interruption.</i>] This is not an easy issue to deal with, as the RUC has repeatedly pointed out. It consistently seeks to bring people to justice, but it encounters the problem to which the hon. Gentleman referred: people are not prepared to come forward as witnesses. It is deeply regrettable that that reluctance may be the result of intimidation. We have tried to establish a programme of witness protection, but even our attention to that aspect of justice does not encourage people to come forward. The agencies of law and order cannot achieve the hon. Gentleman's objective unless people co-operate with them and submit evidence. That is the only way in which people can be brought to justice—an objective that cannot be achieved by shouting in this Room.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is constantly receiving advice on the ceasefire and keeps it under strict review.

	<div class='title'>Devolution in Northern Ireland</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>11.3 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of devolution in Northern Ireland.</p></blockquote>
I should like to begin by thanking the Committee for the opportunity to discuss the important subject of devolution in Northern Ireland. The story of the road to devolution, as played out on the political stage, is familiar to us all. Thirty years of armed conflict, spurred on by diversity and different aspirations for the political and constitutional future of Northern Ireland, have left an indelible mark. Since May 1997, we have striven with the Northern Ireland political parties and the Irish Government to devise a new political settlement that will be for all the people of Northern Ireland, whatever their religion, creed or background. The outcome of those endeavours was, of course, the Good Friday agreement, which provides for the first time an agreed approach to fundamental issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Committee will know, the Good Friday agreement set out arrangements for the establishment of a devolved power-sharing Assembly, together with an Executive, and for closer cross-border co-operation between north and south and between east and west. It made provision for policing, criminal justice, security, equality and prisoners, which were some of the issues that were discussed in oral questions earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Crucially, the agreement established the principle of consent—the right of the people of Northern Ireland to self-determination. It acknowledged the legitimacy of British sovereignty in Northern Ireland for as long as the majority of its people wish it to be so. At the same time, it recognised the right of a substantial section of the people of Northern Ireland legitimately to pursue the role of a united Ireland—so long as that goal was pursued peacefully and democratically. In that way, it was possible to incorporate the aspirations and political beliefs of nationalists and Unionists into one agreement. Without that, I believe that lasting progress would have been impossible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Since the referendum on 2 May 1998, we have been working hard to give practical and tangible expression to the provisions and principles contained in that historic agreement. Much has been achieved in a short time. Good progress has been made on implementing the agreement's provisions. The reviews of the criminal justice system and policing have both reported. The Police (Northern Ireland) Bill is making steady progress through the House, and we expect next year to introduce legislation arising from the recommendations of the criminal justice review. We proceeded quickly to implement the rights and equality provisions of the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The level of threat is now such that troop numbers are at their lowest for 30 years. Of course, as we made clear in answers to oral questions, the security
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
arrangements are always made under the best possible advice and they reflect the current level of threat. However, although our early progress was very encouraging, the Committee will agree that we still have some way to go before we can move forward on the agreement's provisions for the establishment of devolved government and for decommissioning, both of which are fundamental to the overall settlement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Multi-party talks in Belfast, Dublin, Hillsborough and London have helped to move the process on, and the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) was central to all of those discussions. He will confirm that it was on occasions a halting and frustrating process. I was not the only one to have wondered whether the vision of the Good Friday agreement could be turned into reality. However, between July and November 1999, Senator George Mitchell spent a considerable time—we must acknowledge that it was done at great personal sacrifice—to guide all sides to an agreed conclusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The parties and the two Governments agreed that the power-sharing Executive and related devolved political institutions would quickly be established in return for tangible progress on IRA decommissioning. That was to happen within weeks of devolution. On 2 December 1999, following the signing of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Appointed Day) Order 1999, devolution was established in Northern Ireland for the first time in 30 years. It was a momentous occasion. There were not necessarily joyful celebrations in the street, but there was a mood that willed the arrangements to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly and the Executive Committee quickly got down to business and new Ministers approached their new jobs with energy, ability, skill and commitment. I am not saying that everything that they did was without controversy, but the commitment, will and skill were obvious for all to see. Early on, devolution was shown to be workable and was increasingly popular. Even those who had doubts about the agreement and about some of the arrangements still had a certain pride that locally elected politicians were taking some responsibility for the provision of services and of good government. All of that made suspension on 11 February a disappointment, although the action was necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has explained the reasons why we believed that the political institutions had to be suspended at that time. Recent events have vindicated that decision and have borne out his assertion that suspension would be only temporary. Little more than three months after suspension, devolution has been restored to Northern Ireland. Following a series of intensive discussions between the British and Irish Governments and all the pro-agreement parties, which culminated in the initiative agreed at Hillsborough castle at the end of May, the British and Irish Governments issued a statement in which they announced their intention to implement the remaining aspects of the Good Friday agreement by June 2001. The two Governments called on all paramilitary groups to respond positively in return. From that
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0622">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
point, positive steps towards the restoration of the institutions were taken quickly. On 6 May, the IRA issued what has been termed a "ground breaking" statement, in which it promised to initiate an early confidence-building measure to happen within weeks, and to initiate a process that would result in arms being placed "completely and verifiably" beyond use.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 8 May, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland issued a statement expressing his belief that the conditions now existed to restore the devolved institutions. On 29 May, the restoration order and modification order were signed, devolution came into effect at midnight, and, from that point, Assembly Members, Executive Ministers and all the Committees were once more able to meet. I am delighted that those orders have now been approved by both Houses of Parliament at Westminster, and that devolution is now firmly restored in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 26 May, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning published the report of the two independent arms inspectors, President Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa, which confirmed that the IRA had honoured its commitment to initiate an early confidence-building measure. The two inspectors have now successfully carried out an initial inspection of several IRA arms dumps, and will continue their inspections on a regular basis. That important development has done much to raise confidence in the future of the restored institutions and the prospects for decommissioning. For the first time, we have words as well as deeds to illustrate that the IRA has good intentions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People have talked about deadlines, for understandable reasons. I realise why everyone wants to know when we shall be able to see that decommissioning has finally been achieved. However, the setting of deadlines, and the records that go with them, has been unhelpful. We have tried to impose time scales, but, instead of being achievable, they have become a source of contention. On occasion, they have made progress more difficult.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister saying that the two years set down in the agreement for the completion of disarmament was unhelpful?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The hon. Gentleman knows that I am not saying that. The experience of the Ulster Unionist party is that timetables within timetables can lead to difficulties. That is the simple point that I am trying to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commitment made by the IRA to put its arms completely and verifiably beyond use must, of course, be honoured; all paramilitary groups must make progress on decommissioning, so that the gun can be taken out of Northern Ireland politics for good. Whatever else we may disagree about, that is one thing on which the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson), I and the Committee are united.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the much-vaunted IRA statement makes it perfectly plain that there will be no lasting
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
peace in Northern Ireland until the British presence is removed and partition is ended? What does the Minister have to say about that part of the statement?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many interpretations have been made of the statement; indeed, the hon. Gentleman has made his own. We should not forget that the IRA is still signed up to the agreement. However, I said earlier—I make it absolutely clear—that the Good Friday agreement is based on a number of things, the most important of which is that there will be no change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentlemen needs to focus on that because if the IRA accepts that—it has made clear that it does—the long-term reasons for armed conflict disappear. The future of Northern Ireland from now on will be democratically in the hands of the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the Minister when he says that change has to be brought about by democratic procedures. I share the deep revulsion of the hon. Member for Lagan Valley for the IRA, but if Sinn Fein argues its case for a united Ireland in a peaceable and democratic way, no objection can be made to that argument despite the appalling individual histories of the representatives of the IRA.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To be fair to him, the hon. Member for Lagan Valley would be the first to uphold people's right to argue that position democratically rather than through armed conflict and the force of arms. All people, whether politician or citizen, are right to argue for whatever they want, constitutionally or otherwise. That is what free speech is about.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process has not been easy—we heard examples of that during Question Time—and it is not yet over. Recent interventions have made it clear that all those involved have had real concerns, in some cases justifiable, that still need to be addressed. There continues to be some mistrust on both sides. There have been many issues to address, some of which still understandably cause friction and upset, including some that, I suspect, we all share.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A consistently positive factor has been the commitment to the Good Friday agreement by all who signed up to it. Without the courage, vision and leadership displayed by all those involved, we would not be where we are today. I pay tribute to all those whose contribution has made the new political settlement possible. Of course, the First Minister, the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) played a prominent part in that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The newly restored Assembly has been up and running for a little more than one month. As before, Members of the Assembly have quickly got to grips with the demands and responsibilities of their positions. The brief pause in the operation of the institutions has done nothing to diminish the enthusiasm shown early on or the commitment of most Assembly Members to work diligently on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0623">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
No doubt there will be disputes between parties in the Assembly. We expect that—it is the stuff of politics the world over. It would have been laughable to have thought that everybody would agree on everything from the moment devolution was restored. Points of principle are still at issue between the political parties. For it to be otherwise would be unnatural. There is now a locally accountable and democratically elected Executive and legislature to serve as a focal point for important issues that affect Northern Ireland and its people. We now have a firm basis on which to make progress. We look forward to working with the new Administration and to doing everything that we can to facilitate its success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although I thoroughly enjoyed my many and varied responsibilities under direct rule and then, briefly, those responsibilities and some additional ones during the suspension, I made no secret of the fact that I thought that Northern Ireland Ministers were better equipped to respond to the concerns of Northern Ireland and had a better mandate. Healthy though my parliamentary majority is, not one citizen of Northern Ireland has ever voted for me to do anything. For the most part, local issues should be dealt with by local people who have grown up in the community that they serve and who understand its needs and pressures. Although I will miss the involvement, I was delighted to hand over those short-lived but enjoyable responsibilities at the end of May.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have every confidence that the new devolved institutions will work if they are given all the help that they need and the support of everyone who can give it. Further, I have every confidence in the ability, skill and commitment of much of the Assembly to make progress.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's giving way, as he was perhaps coming to the end of his peroration. Some thought that we would be debating the consequences of devolution and the way in which it affected us in this place. We have had a history of the way in which power has been devolved, and I do not argue with what has been said, but what about the facade created when we ask questions of a UK Minister on subjects for which we in this House were responsible only to discover that they have been transferred to the Northern Ireland Assembly. Surely there is responsibility here for specific Northern Ireland issues. Time and again, we have had problems obtaining replies from the Ministry of Defence and even from the Department of Social Security, which insists that we are raising Northern Ireland issues and passes our queries on. We must be careful not to minimise the role of Northern Ireland Members of Parliament in dealing in the House with issues that may subsequently affect Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not think that a letter or inquiry to the Ministry of Defence would produce the response that the hon. Gentleman describes, as defence is not a devolved matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Ministry has given such a response on a security issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not trying to duck the general principle about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned, but it is a matter for the House authorities rather than for my Department. If a Minister tried to answer a question on a devolved matter that related to Scotland or Wales in the Chamber, he or she would be called to order from the Chair. That has happened several times. We are trying not to escape our ministerial responsibilities or to deny the hon. Gentleman his rights as a Member of Parliament, but to act in accordance with the Chair's general ruling that it is not appropriate for Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office, the Wales Office or the Scotland Office to answer questions on devolved matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the role of House officials in transferring questions, but I was speaking about letters that were sent to Ministers and which were transferred by their Departments. Is the hon. Gentleman sure that the House rules take into account joint concordats between, say, the Westminster Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly, not to mention the Welsh Assembly or the Scottish Parliament? Do the rules properly cover responsibility to answer questions that relate to matters covered by a joint concordat?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The First Minister, the Secretary of State and others are working on a series of arrangements and protocols that will operate between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Northern Ireland Office. By extension, those arrangements will affect the way in which Ministers behave in the House and deal with correspondence. It would not be useful for me to analyse them in detail now. The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point, on which we are, to a large extent, in uncharted territory. For a long time, devolved power has not existed, so we need to work through its consequences. I assure the hon. Gentleman—I suspect that his right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann has given similar assurances—that these issues are live, current and under discussion. We are anxious to provide a resolution that gives hon. Members access to their rights as Members of Parliament and which recognises and respects the authority of the Assembly and the Executive. That is a tricky matter, but with good will we can reach a satisfactory conclusion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

They may be fragrant, but it might not be productive to take them. I can only reiterate what are the ambitions of many of us, but the gift of prophecy is not mine.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Irrespective of our views on the Good Friday agreement, I think that we all hope that a period of political stability will now be possible, allowing for the fact that there cannot always be agreement between everyone. While we respect that, we need a period of security, in which people do not feel that they could be caught up in a horrendous paramilitary event, not of their own making, and in which they feel that the rule of law, of which my right hon. Friend the Minister spoke earlier, is upheld. That is one of the most important values in any peaceful society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, also, for a period of economic stability. The potential of Northern Ireland—some of the potential that is being realised—is enormous. One need only think about some of the major developments in Belfast and the great progress that is being made in the city of Derry, for example, with inward investment from the United States, to realise that economic success beckons in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I could presume to have any ambition for Northern Ireland, it would concern the potential of the city of Belfast—the right hon. Member for Upper Bann will know what I am talking about—to rival Dublin in its attraction to visitors and residents. The Executive and the Assembly must make determinations on some hugely ambitious schemes for the future development of Belfast. They could be very exciting. Those are ambitions. What is important is that the realisation of those ambitions, with our support and that of our colleagues in the Republic of Ireland, is now to a large extent in the hands of directly elected local politicians who have places in the Assembly and its committees and ministerial posts in the Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Even in that context there are different interpretations of how Ministers should behave. Two Ministers are not prepared, for their own reasons, to take part in the proceedings of the Executive. That is slightly irregular and the cause, I understand, of some conflict in the Democratic Unionist party. I said that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) would not tempt me along that road, but he has done.
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
There has, indeed, been dispute in the Democratic Unionist party about how ministerial posts should be handled. I have a copy of the 	<i>Irish News</i> of 1 July.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<br><blockquote><p>Ian Paisley has made one of the most shocking revelations in the history of politics by stating that he is none other than the Pope.

	<br><blockquote><p>Holding out the hope of wearing Cardinal Red for his scarlet-faced Free Presbyterian flock, he said, 'I am the Pope… I make the cardinals'.</p></blockquote>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has spoken about his great economic ambitions and about the power of the devolved Assembly to deal with problems, but the largest industry, the agricultural industry, has virtually gone to the wall in Northern Ireland, yet the devolved Assembly is incapable of doing anything to rescue it. Nor is the Assembly capable of rescuing the textile making-up industry, which has been decimated. All those problems result either from Europe or from global economics, and are totally outside the remit, capacity or power of any devolved Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that I created the space for the hon. and learned Gentleman to make that intervention.

The hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney) is right that some industries are subject to global competition because we live in a global economy. That means that we must achieve the right conditions in every part of the United Kingdom to enable us to compete on an equal basis and to reach the requisite skill levels. There are always problems in government, but provided the right conditions exist and solutions can be applied to those conditions, it is possible to make progress.

Of course, there are special problems in Northern Ireland, particularly relating to motor fuel and the border. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor is aware of those problems and is keeping a watchful eye on the matter. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I do not go any further than that because, were I to do so, I am sure that I would exceed the patience of the Chair, as well as probably exceeding my own grasp on the subject.

Whatever opinion members of the Committee may have of the Good Friday agreement—my hon.

That would be a wholly desirable state of affairs and some progress towards it has already been made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the context of devolution, Northern Ireland is unique in the United Kingdom. Scotland and Wales have established their own devolved institutions, but no other part of the United Kingdom has the tradition and experience of devolution that exists in Northern Ireland. From its creation in 1921, Northern Ireland, while remaining part of the United Kingdom, had a devolved Government and a devolved Parliament that was based on the Westminster system and was able to exercise wide-ranging powers over local services. Stormont, as it came to be known, also had powers over law and order and policing matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The establishment of the Northern Ireland Parliament involved a supreme irony, as the aim of most Ulster Unionists was to stay under the government of the Westminster Parliament. As a result of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, Unionists who had fiercely resisted home rule for the whole of Ireland now found themselves with a home rule Parliament of their own in Northern Ireland. As
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Sir James Craig, pointed out, it was the supreme sacrifice, which was made to remain part of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the occasion to dwell on the record of Stormont, which lasted until it was prorogued in March 1972. Opinions differ sharply but, despite early misgivings, I think that it is safe to say that Stormont established a pattern of devolution to which many people in Northern Ireland became deeply attached. It is also safe to say that what it did, it did efficiently and well. I am reminded of the story of the Fermanagh farmer who could travel up to Stormont in the morning, kick the backside of an official or Minister and still be back home in Fermanagh for tea. No wonder it was described as close-contact, or locally accountable, government. Ever since Stormont was prorogued in 1972, it has been the ambition of successive Governments, Conservative and Labour, to re-establish devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. That has also been the wish of most of the Northern Ireland parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Direct rule from Westminster was always intended to be temporary. With the brief exception of the five months of the power-sharing Executive in 1974, it lasted from 1972 to 1999. Although direct rule can claim to have been a fair and efficient form of administration for Northern Ireland—much has been achieved under it—it has always suffered from one fundamental weakness. Under direct rule, there was a democratic deficit, as no politician elected for a Northern Ireland seat ever served as a Minister in the Northern Ireland Office, let alone had the chance to become Secretary of State. That fostered a culture of permanent opposition among Northern Ireland's politicians. Locally elected politicians, a fair number of whom are sitting behind me, were effectively denied the opportunity to take executive decisions and to be accountable for them to their constituents. Furthermore, the House had to deal with issues such as housing or roads that would be decided locally anywhere else in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Between Westminster and Northern Ireland district councils, which exercise few powers compared with local authorities in the rest of the UK, there was no tier of local government. Despite the welcome addition of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs and this Grand Committee, they have never been a proper substitute for the scrutiny of Northern Ireland legislation that could be provided by an Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although successive Governments have sought to restore devolution and almost all of the Northern Ireland parties have sought to end direct rule, the difficulty has always been to find an acceptable way to achieve it. Since 1972, there has never been any question of going back to the Stormont model of majority rule. Devolution, if it is ever to be stable and durable, must command the allegiance of all sections of the community in Northern Ireland. As the First Minister, the right hon. Member for Upper Bann, said, an Assembly must be
	<br><blockquote><p>a pluralist Parliament for a pluralist people.</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0626">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
That is why we were delighted that, after years of trying, the Northern Ireland parties and the British and Irish Governments agreed an acceptable basis for devolving power through the establishment of an Assembly and an inclusive Executive in the Belfast agreement of 1998. That was, indeed, a landmark development in the history of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, there was a delay of a year and a half between that agreement and the setting up of the Assembly in December 1999. I shall not dwell on the reasons for that, or for the suspension of the Assembly in February. However, we now see the Assembly operating again. The onus is therefore firmly on the paramilitaries to deliver on their obligations under the agreement to decommission their illegal arms and explosives. The whole process relies on confidence, and the confidence to sustain those institutions will come about only if the people of Northern Ireland believe that all the participants are committed, in the words of the agreement, to exclusively democratic and peaceful means.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Listening to the spokesman for the official Opposition, I am encouraged to hear that the Conservative party now supports devolution. Does he agree that those parties that have consistently supported the process throughout were right to do so, despite the fact that a number of his colleagues were wavering and probably being over-cynical in trying to disrupt the long march for peace.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that I understood that intervention. The hon. Gentleman seems to suggest that the Conservative party has a range of political opinion. That is unremarkable. We have always had a range of opinions. If they were honest, most political parties would say the same.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having dealt with that point, I shall now deal with whether my party has been consistently in favour of the Belfast agreement and devolution. An enormous body of record, not least in 	<i>Hansard,</i> would say that my party supported the Belfast agreement. In as much as the hon. Gentleman was kind enough to say that he found a certain congenial tone in my remarks, I am happy. If it pleases him, it pleases me.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall pick up the strands of my argument. One of the defects of the Stormont system to which I alluded was the lack of proper scrutiny by the House. If that had not been the case, mistakes might have been avoided. As members of the Conservative party, we wish the devolved institutions well and pray that they work for all the people of Northern Ireland. We also believe that a close and continuing relationship between the Assembly and this House is essential. Northern Ireland remains part of the United Kingdom and the on-going close involvement of this House will help to underscore that welcome fact.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. David Trimble 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Under-Secretary ranged over the events of the past few months and gave us an admirable account. I will not
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
follow him by dwelling on those matters, but I wish to make a couple brief points before turning to more general issues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One particular point is worth bearing in mind. The Under-Secretary said that the suspension of the first period of devolution from February worked. That is correct, and it is important that people realise that. He also talked about the difficulties of setting deadlines. We must reconsider the argument in that respect. The reason why we, the Under-Secretary and others were advised that one should not set deadlines when dealing with republicans was that—we were told—they would never move under pressure or under threat. The reality is that they only ever move under pressure. Republicans did nothing until the last few days of January; they were given space and opportunity to make progress. It was only at the last minute, when suspension became a clear threat, that they started to do something. What they began at the end of January was clearly inadequate and it was only after the fact of suspension that we saw some genuine movement from them at last.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the view of many, including many of my hon. Friends, the eventual movement was small. They would have liked more significant movement. That issue is separate. However, I hope that we will all be able to agree on the simple facts as I have stated them. Movement occurred only under pressure and that pressure would not have been applied without the threat and the fact of suspension. I hope that the lessons from that are well and truly understood.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is equally important to say that devolution in Northern Ireland is still fragile. Much as we hope that it will take root and that it will succeed, we must bear it in mind that devolution is still fragile. There are still problems. The progress that we hope will be made may not be. We may find ourselves revisiting the problems that we had in January and February. I hope that we do not do that and that those who have made promises keep them. They should be under no doubt that the Ulster Unionist party will hold them fully to those promises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rather than dwelling on the past, I should like to reflect on the way in which the situation is developing in Northern Ireland now that we have devolution. I am glad that we have devolution. That is good in terms of providing better administration in Northern Ireland and it is good in itself, in that devolution in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland gives a reflection of the different national characteristics in the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom is not a simple, straightforward unitary state. It is important that the UK's different national identities are reflected. In the distant past, that was done to a large extent through local government, but problems have been caused by the emasculation of local government, which occurred for a variety of reasons over the decades. We hope that those problems can be addressed through the development of devolution in the particular forms that it has taken in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and through the development of regional agencies in England.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0627">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Devolution is a necessary response to the changes that occurred in local government for a variety of reasons. The changes cannot simply be rolled back. There are matters to consider, but devolution takes account of the different national characteristics and is good for that reason. Consequently, the overall effect of devolution in the United Kingdom will be to strengthen the Union, not to weaken it. Already, in the year during which devolution has operated in Wales and Scotland, that process can be seen to be taking effect. I hope that that will happen in Northern Ireland as well.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reference has been made to our experience of the Stormont Parliament as it functioned from 1922 to 1972. Like some of my colleagues here, I grew up during the Stormont Administration. Looking back, I now see that to some extent the way in which I perceived it, while I was growing up in the 1950s and 1960s, was not fully rounded. There were several weaknesses in the arrangements, the primary one being that it was the only devolved Administration in the United Kingdom. We stuck out like a sore thumb, and that was unhealthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An additional weakness related to the trappings of sovereignty around Stormont and the terminology that was used. A clear view existed for a long time that the Stormont Administration had acquired some sovereign characteristics. That view was held not just by the people of Northern Ireland but, at one stage, by the Law Officers of the Crown and, indeed, the Labour party, which famously decided, in the 1920s, to stop organising in Northern Ireland, because it was an independent state and no longer a part of the United Kingdom. If the Minister goes back over his party history, he will find that that is why his party ceased to organise in Northern Ireland. He may want to review the matter, because the factual basis on which the decision was taken is perhaps not as robust as was thought.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not add to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to mention the difficulties with what was called the convention, which my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South touched on. Issues relating to Northern Ireland were not adequately considered in Westminster in the period up to 1972. Something else flowed from that, which was just as significant. Northern Ireland's elected representatives were marginalised in the institution, even in the pre-1972
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
period. Northern Ireland society and the people as a whole found that they were marginalised in national politics. That was not and is not healthy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The present arrangements avoid the problems that I have identified, because devolution is happening in a clear United Kingdom context, which is evident not just from the comparable arrangements in Wales and Scotland, but also from the practical outworkings of devolution. Two aspects of that are important. The first was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South. The various concordats that are being evolved between the devolved Administration and Government Departments are significant. They provide ways for the devolved Administrations to communicate with national Government and co-ordinate activity with national Government in important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One extremely important context for what I have described is in relations with the European Union. The hon. Member for North Down pointed out that policy on a very significant industry of ours—agriculture—is determined effectively in Brussels. However, we are working out arrangements with the Government on representation that will enable Northern Ireland to be involved, within the United Kingdom representation on the Council of Ministers, more effectively than in the past. Similar arrangements are being made in relation to Wales and Scotland, which are especially useful. The arrangements that are being developed with regard to joint ministerial councils are also useful. It would be desirable if more publicity could be given to the work of joint ministerial councils, both nationally and within the House. They bring together Ministers in the devolved Administrations with the appropriate Whitehall Ministers to consider policies that have implications for the devolved regions. Those JMCs are significant in co-ordinating policy and with regard to the operations of the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South referred to the Government's response to the fourth report of the Select Committee on Procedure relating to the procedural consequences of devolution. He referred in particular to the Government's recommended resolution on how questions could be tabled. The Government recommended that, with regard to devolved matters, the areas in which questions could be tabled should include:
	<br><blockquote><p>Matters which…are subject to a concordat or other instrument of liaison between the UK Government and the devolved executive, or UK Government ministers have taken an official interest in.</p></blockquote>
I am unsure whether that very good resolution has been passed by the House, a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If that resolution is passed, that would mean that questions could be tabled in the House on any matter being considered by a JMC, such as health, in which my hon. Friend is keenly interested. There have already been three JMCs on health. If that resolution is passed, my hon. Friend will be able to table questions for answer in the House on matters that relate to Northern Ireland and which have been considered by the JMC. As that involves the entire health service, it opens up a significant field. I am unsure whether Members of the House appreciate its
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0628">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
significance. I make those comments on the assumption that the Government's recommended resolution has made progress within the House, and if it has not, I urge the Government to ensure that it does so. We should not be cautious about opening up such matters for debate. The convention that existed from 1922 to 1972 was unhealthy and I believe that it is desirable to raise a wider range of devolved issues for debate in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another route by which devolved issues can be raised in the House is in considering funding arrangements. Until 1972, the funding arrangements for Stormont were very much ad hoc and had developed a long way from the basic legislation contained in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. There is now some consistency in funding for the devolved regions because, for all of them, funding is based on the Barnett formula. That formula evolved in 1979 and recognised different levels of expenditure in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland based on need. It also provided that when expenditure is increased for England and Wales, an increase based on a per capita percentage of the population in the devolved area should be introduced for comparable programmes. The significance of that is that it provides for increases for comparable programmes, and if block grants are determined by reference to the comparability of programmes, that will enable people in the House to question those programmes. An important point underlying that is the parity principle, which was one of the main principles on which we operated during the Stormont years. The parity principle is simple; people in Northern Ireland, like people in Wales and Scotland, pay the same taxes as people in the rest of the United Kingdom. Consequently, they are entitled to the same quality of public service. The parity principle applies not only to benefits, but to quality of service. People who pay the same taxes as every other citizen in the United Kingdom are entitled to the same service quality, or at least one that does not differ significantly. It may cost more to deliver a service in a dispersed rural area such as the highlands and islands of Scotland or parts of Northern Ireland than in more densely populated areas. However, that is beside the point, as people who pay the same taxes are entitled to the same quality of service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The question is what is needed to deliver the service. Whether it is achieved through finance measures or more general policies, there should be greater opportunity to consider these matters in the House. Mentioning the Barnett formula brings to mind one of the discoveries that I made about it after devolution. Before devolution, I had believed that the formula was a good thing from the point of view of the devolved Administrations, as it guaranteed significant levels of funding. However, I discovered after devolution that it does not necessarily provide such a guarantee. In fact, it can operate retrogressively in respect of the devolved institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall give two examples of how significant increases in expenditure for programmes in England and Wales have had a deflationary effect on available expenditure. First, in the past financial year, spending
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
on health in Northern Ireland was 8.6 per cent. above the national average. As a result of the health spending increases that were announced by the Chancellor in his Budget statement, additional sums were made available in Northern Ireland. However, they were calculated on a per capita basis rather than on a needs basis, although the original Barnett formula was based on needs. After those increases were made, the amount that was available for spending on health in Northern Ireland was only 4.8 per cent. above the national average. The steepness of the increases meant that per capita spending dropped from 8.6 per cent. to 4.8 per cent. above the national average. Of course, people in Northern Ireland will expect the same increase in service, which will be difficult to cost when there is not the same percentage increase in the funds that are available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second example is education. When funds are increased in England and Wales, Northern Ireland receives an increase that is based on per capita figures. However, we have a higher percentage of people in education than England and Wales. Off the top of my head, I think that 16 per cent. of the population in England and Wales are in primary and secondary education, while 20 per cent. of the Northern Ireland population are in such education. The consequence of our per capita increase is that for every £1 per pupil of extra spending in England and Wales, Northern Ireland receives 76p, although we are expected to fund the same increases in service provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are clear disadvantages to a formula that we thought to be useful, but which has serious deflationary effects. We can live with that problem in the short term, but in the long and even the medium term, it will cause serious problems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I know that it is the habit of some English Members to speak about Barnett with a completely different agenda in mind. They may not appreciate the extent to which there are problems in the operation of Barnett in the devolved regions and the consequent need for a proper needs-related assessment of expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I return to the basic principle of parity. For paying the same taxes, everybody in the United Kingdom is entitled to the same quality of service. The question is how to assess the cost of providing that service in the different regions. Those issues are of a different type from the matters that have engaged the Committee in the past, but it will increasingly have to consider them. The extent to which it is able to do so will be the true mark of the progress that we are making.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0629">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
questions. I hope that devolution loses its fragility and that it becomes more robust, but that depends on all concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Political devolution in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales is a Labour achievement of which we can justly be proud. I need hardly remind the Committee that it was bitterly opposed from top to bottom by the Conservative party. It could be argued that such profound constitutional change should be introduced only as part of a comprehensive reform programme. That comment is based on the complicated and interrelated nature of the constitution of this multi-national state of ours, the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their remarkable book "Remaking the Union: Devolution and British Politics in the 1990s", Howard Elcock and Michael Keating say that the United Kingdom seems to be
	<br><blockquote><p>on the brink of large-scale changes in the way it is governed, in the relationships of its constituent parts, and in the bonds between citizens and governors. As usual, this is being done piecemeal, with little regard to an overall plan or even consistency, but a process is being set in train which could have radical implications.</p></blockquote>
They were right to talk of radical implications. However, among other factors, political reality prevented the Government from adopting a more deliberative, thoughtful and constructive approach to political devolution. That is particularly true of the political circumstances of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On Third Reading of the Bill that became the Northern Ireland Act 1998, I suggested that it was inevitable that such legislation would have unintended as well as intended consequences. The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) said during that debate that I had made a most chilling observation on the consequences of devolution. During a debate on the Bill that became the Scotland Act 1998, and in the context of a changing United Kingdom constitution, my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) told us in his Cassandra-like way that we were witnessing the unravelling of the United Kingdom. Others suggested that we were seeing its unbundling and rebundling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some hon. Members were not quite so doom-laden in their prognoses. My right hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Anniesland (Mr. Dewar), who I am glad to say is making a speedy recovery from his serious operation, said just over a year ago that the debate on constitutional reform would not stop once the doors of the Scottish Parliament had been opened. That can also be said about the creation of the Northern Ireland Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another observer, writing in a Northern Ireland magazine said:
	<br><blockquote><p>The scale of Prime Minister Blair's constitutional adventure is unparalleled and its endgame unknown, perhaps even to him. What is certain is that the process is irreversible…the UK's tectonic plates have shifted.</p></blockquote>
My hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) suggested in an article in 	<i>The Herald</i> on 17 January that devolution will inevitably lead to the setting up of an English Parliament. He said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>It is inevitable. It was virtually written in stone as soon as we set up devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p></blockquote>
I promise to make the briefest speech that hon. Members have heard this morning. Most members of the Committee know that I spent a day at the Assembly shortly before its regrettable suspension. It was on the day of the massive lobby by farmers. I spoke to some of them and said how remarkable it was that they could approach a Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development at Stormont and that they could lobby Assembly Members directly. Some of the farmers said that they could not have got across to London to lobby a Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who is the lead Minister with regard to Brussels. I was there from the start of business to the finish and I saw an Assembly going about its work just as this Parliament and the Scottish Parliament go about their work.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman described the new capacity of members of the Northern Ireland electorate to lobby Ministers. What is the point of being able to lobby Ministers who can do absolutely nothing on one's behalf?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a typically pessimistic intervention from the hon. and learned Gentleman. Farmers in Northern Ireland, like those in Scotland, have an open door to a Minister who has direct access to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and who works with that Department. I urge the hon. and learned Gentleman to speak with the farmers in his constituency. The farmers in the west of Scotland have told me that it is good to have a Rural Affairs Minister in the Scottish Executive. That Minister happens also to be a local Member of the Scottish Parliament, but that is another matter.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Member for North Down was carried away in his enthusiasm. Where issues are covered by a common policy or amount to state aids, domestic Ministers might be limited in what they can do. If an issue is not covered by a common policy or a state aid, the local Ministers can act. The Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland last week introduced three new programmes that will directly benefit farmers. Those programmes are not state aids and are not covered by common matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am exceedingly grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Obviously, he knows far more than I about the agriculture industry in Northern Ireland. In response, I say to him that the farming community in Scotland holds the Edinburgh Minister for Rural Affairs in high regard. That is the same for the fishing industry in Scotland—it too has respect for its Ministers in the Scottish Executive. I am pleased to hear that the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the Northern Ireland Executive is able to carry out good work on behalf of the farming community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was saying that I was in the Assembly on the day of the farming lobby. Business finished on that day with a Democratic Unionist party-sponsored motion titled
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0630">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
"Disruption in our Schools". No Member of this House has suffered vilification such as that heaped on the head of the Minister for Education in the Assembly on that evening.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Rightly so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not responding to a sedentary intervention, but I will say that I can understand the revulsion felt by many Unionist Assembly Members at having to sit beside Assembly colleagues with such appalling records as terrorists or as the close associates of terrorists. In an intervention on my hon. Friend the Minister, I said that I shared their revulsion. However, if those with such dreadful pasts are now committed to seeking their political object of a united Ireland by peaceable democratic means and if they always accept the principle of consent, we must accept their place in the democratic institutions of the United Kingdom. That means the Northern Ireland Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The principle of consent must remain unchallenged, as it is in Scotland, where secessionists pursue their objective—an independent Scotland—peaceably and democratically. We do not see their Westminster representatives very often in Westminster, despite the extra money that they get for being here. They were recently referred to as day trippers by another Scots Member of Parliament, but in their unceasing campaign for an independent Scotland they are as peaceable and as democratic as anyone else in this place. I have long argued that the supporters of Sinn Fein in the American Congress and elsewhere should urge their friends to play the same democratic long game.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In their different ways, the Welsh Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly opened their doors in difficult circumstances. That is obviously true of Northern Ireland. A friend in Belfast sent me an e-mail yesterday. It read:
	<br><blockquote><p>Last week 17 committees met—</p></blockquote>
he was referring to the Assembly—
	<br><blockquote><p>14 Ministers decided, 10 new Departments worked, six cross-border bodies progressed, four new Commissions operated, two Arms Inspectors inspected…</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>Bills, motions, opinions, debates, scrutiny, questions—all the parts of a functioning democracy are in place—from democratic deficit (about which we all complained) to democracy in action—wonderful to behold!</p></blockquote>
I have a couple of questions for the Minister. Is the British-Irish Council to have a permanent secretariat? If discussions have taken place in the two meetings of the council, where is the secretariat to be located? I do not for a moment suggest that it should be in Greenock, but it might, for example, be situated in Scotland, rather than in a Dublin, London or Manx location.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have another plea. I hope that as the Assembly goes from strength to strength it will reform local government. The Edinburgh Parliament is engaged in that task at this very moment, much to the annoyance of some councillors. However, I look forward to a similar achievement by the Stormont Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that democracy has been diminished by those who have permitted into Government in the Northern Ireland Assembly those who have not clearly put their past behind them and made it clear that they will be committed in future solely to democratic means? Is not the democratic process diminished by the threat that people who have not completely dissociated themselves from their paramilitary past may return to such activity?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The principle of consent will bring them into accepting the processes of democracy. As I said earlier, in response to the right hon. Member for Upper Bann, if those people pursue their political goals in a peaceable and democratic way, for all their revolting history we should acknowledge that they have a role to play in our democratic institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Incidentally, I shall be absent for the Under-Secretary's winding-up speech, and I have apologised to him for that. I need to be present at the handing in of a petition at 10 Downing street by shop stewards from the Govan shipyard on the upper Clyde. I have more constituents working in that yard than any other Member of Parliament for a Scottish constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the right hon. Member for Upper Bann: democracy is still in a fragile state. The Assembly has not advanced as far as the Scottish Parliament. None the less, I look to the Members of the Assembly to perform their duties in a principled and honourable way, on behalf of their constituents.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.25 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, I thank the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) for being so nice to my mother, when she visited last week—	<i>[Interruption.]</i>—on the Terrace. The warm exchanges that took place between the hon. Gentleman and my mum would not have been possible if he had not played such a constructive and proactive role in the devolutionary process through some difficult times in the past two years. I thank him for being nice to my mother and to Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman and those who think as he does have made it possible for us to be here, celebrating the return of devolution to Northern Ireland. It has been a hard journey and has demanded great spirit from all parts of the House, particularly from hon. Members who represent Northern Ireland constituencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to acknowledge the key players in the peace process. Obviously, there is the right hon. Member for Redcar (Marjorie Mowlam), who, as Secretary of State, played a key role, as did the right hon. Member for Upper Bann and many of his colleagues, as well as many people from the other side of the so-called sectarian divide. However, I should also mention the right hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Major). Although I have had many differences of opinion with his party about Northern Ireland, the right hon. Gentleman was, undoubtedly, sincere in his efforts to kick-start the recent efforts to achieve peace. His contribution to the establishment of the devolution
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0631">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
that has now taken place is an achievement of which he should be proud, and for which he will always be remembered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I said that I had had some differences with the Conservative party. We all have to make judgments about when to support the Government's actions in Northern Ireland. I intimated, perhaps too gently, that the official Opposition have, at times, acted in a rather contradictory fashion in relation to the Good Friday agreement and the peace process. I have been rather dissatisfied with some of the votes that they have prompted in the House, for those votes have not always been in the best interests of the peace process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry that the hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) is not here; I would have been happy to let him intervene if he had felt that I was being unkind. However, the official Opposition should show some contrition about the decisions that they have taken. On occasions, their actions have made it difficult for hon. Members who represent constituencies in Northern Ireland to take the action that they wanted. They have been constrained by votes that have not been in the best interests of Northern Ireland Members who have taken the peace process seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Clearly, we are in a process of transition and devolution is building up a momentum at Stormont. It seems to be working. The Under-Secretary said that he foresees many economic benefits from the process of devolution and I think that he is right. Northern Ireland is still a low-wage, but not particularly a low-skill, economy. The low-wage aspect will play a part in attracting industry to the Province, which is all to the good. However, we must acknowledge that one of the desirable outcomes of devolution should be to build up those wages. Simply to trade on the attractiveness of low wages is not a sustainable position, given that that means that employees are not being paid what they would be worth in other parts of the United Kingdom or comparable parts of Europe.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One of the most dramatic aspects of devolution has been the new way in which we have had to address cultural differences. We often hear about the two communities in Northern Ireland. As I have pointed out many times in the Standing Committee on the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill, there are more than two communities in Northern Ireland. We ignore at our peril the many diverse traditions that are represented in Northern Ireland—the same traditions that are often under-represented on the mainland of the United Kingdom. If devolution is to represent all sides in Northern Ireland, we must ensure that those other communities and traditions are also shown regard. We should not stereotype everyone as being a member of one community or the other—broadly speaking, either Unionist or nationalist.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the hon. Gentleman support changes in the Assembly in that respect? As he will know, the voting pattern in the Assembly means that key decisions are judged on the basis of a sectarian head count. Does he feel that that method of voting should change?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. I cannot suggest in the context of this debate how those structures might evolve, but in years to come we must tackle the sectarianisation of the Assembly's voting system, which is wholly based on nationalist-versus-Unionist considerations. The hon. Gentleman's suggestion is correct: communities are not necessarily brought together when the vote count is dependent on highlighting a divide that is often not even present in the eyes of the people who are voting. I am encouraged to hear the hon. Gentleman making that point and I thank him for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Looking beyond the Stormont Assembly, devolution offers an opportunity to encourage the development of non-governmental organisations, which have always operated in Northern Ireland but which now have the opportunity to influence its future more directly. For example, the Ulster Cancer Foundation now has the opportunity to work directly with Assembly Members in Northern Ireland to try to combat a disease that kills more people every year than the troubles have killed in three decades.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman suggests that the Ulster Cancer Foundation should be able to work with Northern Ireland Ministers to further developments in cancer research. Does he agree that there is not enough money in the block budget to cover that and that it must therefore be tackled on a United Kingdom-wide basis, especially as Northern Ireland now has one of the finest centres for cancer research in the world?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. It is sad that the Ulster Cancer Foundation felt the need to come to lobby directly at Westminster two weeks ago, to raise the serious issue of finance. Perhaps, through devolution, we can expect the voice of the Ulster Cancer Foundation to be heard loudly in Northern Ireland, but that will not detract from central Government's responsibility to make sure that the Northern Ireland Assembly has the money to provide the foundation with the funds that it so desperately needs to save lives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other organisations probably see devolution as an opportunity to express their views more loudly, and in a more egalitarian environment in which they will not be drowned out by the endless strains and tensions caused by the peace process. One such organisation is the Bahai group in Northern Ireland. It practises a growing monotheistic faith that has been represented in Northern Ireland for many years, and I pay tribute to its work. As the devolution process beds in, the secular environment and tolerance that should follow could help such an organisation to feel comfortable in expressing its unique beliefs, and unintimidated in so doing in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the hon. Gentleman may be misguiding the Committee in his statement. In what way have the Bahai people felt inhibited in Northern Ireland? A great proportion of them live in Belfast, South and I represent them both here and elsewhere. At no time have they complained that their liberties have been compromised in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0632">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I gave the impression that the Bahais had suggested that they had been intimidated, that was wrong. The hon. Member for Belfast, South probably represents the highest proportion of Bahais in Northern Ireland and he is right to pick me up on that point. I would not want the record to suggest that they felt discriminated against at all.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To be clear, I am saying that I would like to think that organisations such as the Bahais will benefit from devolution because they will have local access to the decision makers, and will be able to lobby on a local basis for project funding that was previously accessible only by coming to London. The hon. Member for Belfast, South is right. The Bahais have never said—to me, at least—that they have felt any discrimination, and I have no doubt that the hon. Gentleman has always handled any contact with the Bahais in a positive and proactive fashion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Butterfill. It is difficult to see the relevance of this subject, or to justify the amount of time being taken up by a discussion of the presence of the Bahai sect in Northern Ireland, when it is not even being suggested that it has been under any kind of pressure that devolution might alleviate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order. It is for me to determine whether a matter under discussion is relevant. I have to say that my patience was becoming a little strained, but, nevertheless, the matter was just within the borders of what might be discussed as part of this topic.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No doubt, as I speak, the Bahai community in Northern Ireland is praying for me to move on—[Hon. Members: "They are not the only ones."]—as are others in the Room, so I shall do so now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was nervous to follow me down the rosy, lilac-strewn lanes of prediction, in looking to the future. That sounds like a description of the Lagan towpath in summer time. However, he was willing to speculate about the economic benefits that might accrue to Northern Ireland, and he was right to do that. In a practical sense, the greatest impact that peace will have on most people will be to bring them a better quality of life as a direct result of the prosperity that will, I hope, feed into Northern Ireland's infrastructure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
THE CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that ten Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and ten Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fear that the Committee's lack of quorum may reflect on some parts of my speech. I shall move swiftly towards my conclusion, before we become inquorate again.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We should examine three matters in this context. First, how can Westminster support Northern Ireland's economic development? Secondly, how can we assist Northern Ireland's infrastructure development? For example, whatever one believes to
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
be the right way to restructure the police force, our discussions of that matter provide an opportunity to establish a system for administering law and order that could be world beating. Thirdly, we should recognise the centres of excellence that can evolve internationally as devolution takes hold. I have a long association with the Armagh observatory, which can probably make a contribution to astronomy that is world beating. Committee members may agree that we can be world beating in other contexts—I refer them, for example, to the Tayto crisp. I still slightly frustratedly await its arrival on the mainland of the United Kingdom. Another world-beating centre of excellence is the Royal Belfast Academical Institution, which is unquestionably the best school in Northern Ireland—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is joking.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There's none so blind as those who will not see.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Devolution should help us to give our heroes a more significant international standing than that which they previously enjoyed. I hope that Committee members will indulge me and let me briefly note my sadness at the death of Joey Dunlop, who was unquestionably a great ambassador for Northern Ireland. He died tragically in Estonia as a result of a road accident while indulging in a sport to which he had devoted his life, namely, motorcycling.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Caerphilly (Mr. Davies) said of devolution in Wales that it was not an event but a process. We shall take part in that process for many years. We need seriously to consider how best to restructure Westminster's relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are taking their rightful place in what is becoming a federation rather than a monolithic union. In the not-too-distant future, there may be a Minister for the isles and Under-Secretaries of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland—however, that is a matter for future debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall finish as I started. I am pleased that we have got this far. Those who took the risk to support the process have done the right thing. By and large, I praise the Government for being steadfast in their resolve. Although they have occasionally gone down the wrong path, they have always acted in good faith. The commitment to devolution of the present and the previous Governments has been rewarded by a more rosy future for Northern Ireland, which many of us could not have dreamed of even five years ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have never been an enthusiast for the process of devolution. Whenever it has been proposed as a solution, people have argued that it would provide more efficient, more accessible and more accountable government for those who were subject to it. An examination of all of the occasions on which it has been proposed as a solution, starting with the introduction of devolved government in Northern Ireland in 1921, shows that its real purpose was to solve a specific and pressing political
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0633">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
problem of the day and to do so on the basis of expediency. None of the examples of devolution that have been discussed today provides an exception to that principle.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Upper Bann said that devolution in Northern Ireland is on a par with comparable arrangements in Scotland and Wales—a patently wrong and fallacious statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The usual principle of democracy that applies in Scotland and Wales is that parties with an overall majority, or parties able to form a majority in coalition with others, form the Government. The fundamental principle of democracy is that when a Government act incompetently or wrongly, the electorate have an opportunity to turn them out in the next election. That principle is patently absent in what passes for democracy in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The form of the Assembly and Executive in Northern Ireland was set up under the Belfast agreement—piously referred to by a collection of atheists, freethinkers, humanists and agnostics as the Good Friday agreement. The Belfast agreement, to give it its proper and official title, set up an Assembly purely to establish institutions in Northern Ireland with little or no real democratic element within them. It was intended, as Sinn Fein-IRA constantly reminds us, to be nothing more than a transitional arrangement to make Northern Ireland into a republic. The only institutions within the Belfast agreement that are afforded any dynamic are cross-border institutions, which are intended to grow and become stronger as part of a gradual evolution not of democratic processes in Northern Ireland, but of institutions fitted for a united Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If we examine fundamental democratic principles in Northern Ireland, what do we find? There is no possibility of majority rule. I am not a majoritarian. I do not believe in unqualified or unbridled majority rule, nor do I wish to return to a Stormont form of institution. However, I believe in majority rule with all the in-built protections—equality and human rights legislation—that apply in democracies throughout Europe. They have proved to be capable of protecting minority rights when the principle of majority parties ruling the country is in place.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the alleged forms of democracy in Northern Ireland, the majority is electorally neutralised. The pro-Union population are the majority, but they are forced into a consensus Government, which underpins organised, in-built sectarianism. We have a nationalist Deputy First Minister and a Unionist First Minister and we have 10 Ministries divided equally between nationalists and unionists. The Ministers are appointed on the basis of neither merit nor collective responsibility. They have been established as individual political warlords within their own Ministry
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
and can do whatever they like. They can ignore the criticism of scrutiny committees and can even ignore the Assembly's decisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What of the future? We are supposed to be discussing the development of democracy and devolution. What will happen if, after the first four-year period of office, Ministers prove to be the most incompetent, negligent and immoral who have ever held office? Broadly speaking, the same people will be returned and the Ministers will be selected not by a leader but by the parties. The process is quite capable of returning the same people to office. The fundamental principle of democracy, that the electorate can change the Government, is not working effectively in Northern Ireland; it is a fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government in Westminster are pursuing an ethical foreign policy; they tell everyone that the ambassadors of European Union countries are not to speak to representatives of the Austrian Government because Mr. Haider's Freedom party might, in coalition, form part of it. The Freedom party has not murdered anyone, organised terrorist activities or been responsible for the destruction of property, but it is treated like a pariah.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Under the fraudulent form of devolution in Northern Ireland, the party in government in Westminster pressurises, cajoles, coaxes and persuades democrats to sit down with the representatives of a party whom the Prime Minister has described on more than one occasion as inextricably linked with a terrorist organisation. That organisation attempted to assassinate the British Cabinet in Brighton, mortar-bombed 10 Downing street and murdered more than 2,500 British citizens. Its bombing of the Baltic exchange cost £800 million, of Manchester £200 million, and of Canary wharf £100 million and £615 million has been spent on reparation and compensation in Northern Ireland since 1969. Yet those who know little about what is happening on the ground in Northern Ireland say that there has been a seismic shift—a manifestation of great democratic benefit to Northern Ireland. There has been no such thing and time and circumstance will show the truth that is being suppressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann spoke about the fragility of devolution. Trust and confidence are needed. I echo what was said earlier: the steps taken by the Provisional IRA in opening up some of its arms dumps are insufficient in themselves to create the confidence, especially among the Unionist electorate, that the IRA is fully committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. It has some way yet to travel to establish that confidence—it will take more than opening a few arms dumps for secret inspection.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that we all shared the objective of taking the gun out of politics. That is important. I do not accept the comments made by the Irish Prime Minister, Mr. Ahem, who said of the IRA's initiative:
	<br><blockquote><p>I am just glad that this has been resolved. This is a good day. I think that brings the decommissioning saga to, hopefully, a successful end.</p></blockquote>
Clearly, that is not the case. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann said, we now need the next steps towards proper decommissioning of the IRA's weaponry to be taken, in accordance with the relevant legislation passed by Parliament.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that General de Chastelain will soon be able to report that he has made progress in his discussions with the Provisional IRA towards achieving actual and verifiable decommissioning of its weapons. That is important for establishing confidence, and if that does not happen, that confidence could be undermined until devolution is again called into question. That is unfortunate. I have long held the view that the future of devolution should not be susceptible to the actions of one organisation, and that is why I wanted effective mechanisms in the devolution legislation for excluding from office those who failed to commit in time to exclusively peaceful means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I urge the Government to reconsider those provisions. We do not want devolution to collapse again because one party failed to honour its commitments. If that happens, instability will be increased. I hope that the Government can provide more effective mechanisms for excluding such people from office. Having said that, I hope that those parties do not fail and that they deliver on the arms issue.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equally, we expect progress from the so-called loyalist paramilitary groups. Recently, we have seen appalling displays from some of those loyalist groups. They must make progress on the arms issue and remove their illegal weapons from the political equation. What we want and need is proper and verifiable decommissioning, as quickly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The devolved Administration in Northern Ireland can deliver more effective government, if they deal with issues that are important to people, such as the appalling state of the railways in Northern Ireland. I know that the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs is concluding an inquiry into that, and as a former member of that Committee, I look forward to reading its report. However, a task force is also examining that issue. Although it is a devolved matter, I hope that adequate funding will be made available, perhaps through additional resources from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
Treasury. I understand that a future Government initiative may deal with the need for more funding for public transport. Spending on transport in Northern Ireland is less than that in the rest of the United Kingdom. We must close that gap, improve the safety of the railway network for users and encourage more people to use public transport. If devolution can help to achieve that, it will have benefited all the people in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face other difficulties. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire referred to identities. He is absolutely right that that is part of the problem in Northern Ireland. One aspect is the question of national identity. Hon. Members will be aware of the strong feelings among members of the Unionist community, who are concerned that their sense of Britishness is being eroded.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Difficult problems, such as the flying of the Union flag, are involved. Parliament recently passed the Flags (Northern Ireland) Order 2000, which deals with that issue. The Minister will be aware that the Executive deliberated on the flying of the Union flag, but failed to reach agreement. When will the Secretary of State use the powers granted to him under that order to make regulations for the flying of the Union flag on public buildings on designated days? The issue needs to be cleared up and I hope that the Secretary of State will in the near future introduce regulations that will finally resolve it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question is that of the wider relationships on which devolution has an impact, including the east-west relationship. The hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Dr. Godman) referred to a permanent secretariat for the Council of the Isles, as it has become known. He may find it strange—I am sorry that he is not present to hear this—that Unionists would support the placement of that secretariat in Glasgow, in recognition of the fact that the council draws people from right across these islands. Glasgow, rather than London or Dublin, would be a good location. I recently visited the Isle of Man and the Manx Parliament, where people are enthusiastic about the future of the initiative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I encourage the Government to give more prominence to the east-west relationship. At times, it seems that that is the poorer relationship in terms of the time and energy devoted to it. In a sense, however, it is perhaps the most important for addressing the totality of relationships. I hope that the Government will find a suitable location and establish a permanent secretariat for the council.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome devolution for Northern Ireland, but I share many of the concerns expressed by the hon. and learned Member for North Down about aspects of it. In an intervention on the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, I mentioned the voting system in the Assembly. If we are to move towards a truly pluralist society in Northern Ireland, we must get away from sectarian head counts. Proper safeguards need to be built into the Assembly and all the mechanisms of Government, but I hope that we can reach a level of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0635">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
political maturity at which we do not depend on that sort of voting system. It only perpetuates divisions and makes it difficult, practically, to make decisions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McWalter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: While I agree with the hon. Gentleman's aspiration, it is important that those safeguards are in place as an interim measure.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That may be the case. The debate might be about the length of the interim. The sooner that we can move beyond that, the better and more healthy will be the democracy and democratic institutions that we are building in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the fragility mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann is to be removed, so that what is in place can become more permanent, a number of things need to happen. Not least is the need for parties that have taken up places in the Executive and that are linked to paramilitary organisations to ensure that the required progress on decommissioning is made. That must go further. Northern Ireland wants an end to paramilitarism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As one drives round and sees the paramilitary groups staking out their territory, it is difficult to envisage how we move beyond paramilitarism, but the Assembly must play a role in achieving that, and it is important to explore how it can have an impact. The parties linked to paramilitaries cannot have it both ways. If they are to participate in the Assembly, the violence and all the manifestations of paramilitarism must end, especially the racketeering and the gangsterism that are now the mark of paramilitary activities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a danger that two societies will develop in Northern Ireland. I am talking not about a sectarian division, but about a middle Ulster that enjoys the benefits of the process, and another Ulster that lives under the continual influence, intimidation and violence of the paramilitary organisations. All who are committed to peace, democracy and political stability in Northern Ireland must tackle that real danger, because we cannot continue to brush it under the carpet. The issue must be faced head on—the sooner, the better.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.6 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: To some extent, my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) have pre-empted my comments. I shall illustrate the problems of demarcation with my own experiences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The demarcation of responsibilities between national Ministers and Ministers in the devolved institutions is important, because the United Kingdom Ministers decide United Kingdom policy and pass the primary legislation on which the rest of the kingdom builds. The powers of the devolved bodies are limited, and as in the old Stormont days, we will eventually find
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
that much of our work involves rubber-stamping decisions taken in Westminster on a large expanse of Government responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, we have an interest in what happens in all parts of the kingdom, not least because the policies pursued in Scotland, for example, might provide lessons for England, or because decisions taken in Wales or Northern Ireland might have an unforeseen impact on England or Scotland. A unitary Parliament can deal with such matters, as we did on the Floor of the House and in Committee. That will not be the case in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As a Northern Ireland Member of Parliament, I have always been acutely aware—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) leaves, the Committee will be inquorate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: For the second time, the long-standing principle that it is the responsibility of the party in government to ensure that the Committee remains quorate is brought to mind. I hope that the Whip will bear that in mind.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have always been acutely aware of the problems as well as the merits inherent in devolution. I have always believed that the United Kingdom is greater than the sum of its components and that it confers great benefits on all our citizens, so my approach to devolution has always been coloured by the belief that the continuance of the Union has to be the fulcrum on which most political and all constitutional decisions turn in the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, my view is not shared by regional nationalists, whether they are Scots, Welsh or Irish nationalists, or Irish republicans. None of them denies that they are working towards separation. I have always taken the view that the unity of the kingdom can be secured only if each devolved institution is Unionist in nature and pursues policies that strengthen the Union. That is a lesson that the Labour party in Scotland and Wales will learn; it will also discover that the consequence will be a political Unionist-nationalist split rather than the usual split of left and right. Class divisions will become subsumed in questions of nationality and of the form of government—monarchist or republican—under which people desire to live.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the light of devolution, I was not surprised that although I wrote to a United Kingdom Minister, the reply came from a Northern Ireland Minister. As it happened, before I managed to follow up the matter at Christmas, the Assembly was suspended. With its revival, I find that the same thing is happening. It raises anew the West Lothian question—perhaps a repeat of the question asked about West Galway 125 years ago. The hon. Member for Linlithgow asked about decisions being taken for England by Scots Members of Parliament when English Members of Parliament cannot take similar decisions for Scotland. I seek clarification on what happens when we merely seek
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0636">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
information. In pursuit of that aim, I tabled a number of questions last week on minor matters that I believe have UK connotations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My first question was about migratory fish, for I am an angler. The Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all gave answers, as did the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, told me that he would reply as soon possible; the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland told me that it was a devolved matter for Northern Ireland; the Secretary of State for Wales said that he would reply as soon as possible; and the Secretary of State for Scotland replied by the expedient of sending me a copy of the statistical bulletin of the Scottish Executive Rural Affairs Department, pointing out that a copy of that document could be found in the Library.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I next asked a simple question about the number of raptors in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Minister for the Environment, the right hon. Member for Oldham, West and Royton (Mr. Meacher), sent me a detailed reply. The questions for Northern Ireland and Scotland were refused by the Table Office. That, of course, is another aspect of the West Lothian question—how the legitimate interests of Members of Parliament can be addressed in respect of devolved regions. We are not Members of the devolved institutions, their Ministers are not responsible to us, the powers of the Secretaries of State apparently are not such as to enable them to reply, and we are denied information that we could previously obtain by questioning Ministers in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The plain fact is, however, that if Members of Parliament are to do their job for their constituents, some way must be found to make information available to us. The present position is confused, given the various replies that I received to my questions on those small matters; many larger matters will receive similar answers. A common approach is needed. The means chosen by the Secretary of State for Scotland may be a way of doing that, and I hope that the Cabinet will examine it with great care.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second related issue arises as a consequence of a letter that I wrote to the Secretary of State for Health about his examination of state funding for nursing care for elderly people in nursing homes. The letter was sent to him on 20 April. It is not long, and it says:
	<br><blockquote><p>I understand that you are presently examining the question of state funding for nursing care for elderly persons in nursing homes.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I do hope that this will be brought to a speedy conclusion and that you will find it possible to meet the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I would be grateful if you could indicate to me whether younger persons who suffer from conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, which require constant long term care, will also be covered by the changes you are proposing.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>I believe that the total number of younger persons is relatively small but the conditions in which they find themselves are of great concern to their families. Indeed, this whole problem of incapacity to care for themselves resulting from such diseases, at whatever age, is one of the principle reasons for Long Term nursing care and is one which I think has got to be addressed in a sympathetic fashion since the costs to the family dependants are actually such as to sometimes thrust them into penury and there is no long term benefit to the community at large by impoverishing such people.</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
In that letter, I was asking about national standards, and I would have expected a reply from the member of the United Kingdom Cabinet who is ultimately responsible for such decisions. Two months later, however, I received a reply from the Sinn Fein-IRA Minister in Northern Ireland. She referred in her letter to
	<br><blockquote><p>"Alan Milburn MP, Secretary of State for Health in England",</p></blockquote>
which I thought was outside the normal standards of behaviour that one would expect. Not a word of my letter to the Secretary of State suggested that my concern was related to Northern Ireland. I asked about a United Kingdom issue rather than a Northern Ireland issue. Why then was my letter referred to Northern Ireland, apparently automatically? That should not have happened. If I address a request for information to a United Kingdom Minister, I am entitled, as a United Kingdom Member of Parliament, to a reply from that Minister. At least I have a chance to hold him to account on the Floor of the House, something that I cannot do with a Northern Ireland Minister.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister ensure that that such a reply is not given again when a Member of Parliament draws such a clear distinction, unless there are good reasons for passing a letter on to devolved institutions? I do not want to receive again the sort of verbiage that I received in the letter from the Northern Ireland Minister, which was a tribute to the civil service language to which we are, unfortunately, so often subjected. The demarcation lines between devolved bodies and central Government must be clarified and we must get rid of any confusion. I hope that members of the devolved Administrations will act within their own areas of responsibility and that the House will continue to have a massive effect in the years ahead. After all, control of the money supply rests here and not in Northern Ireland, Cardiff or Edinburgh. It is our decisions that will inhibit and, in the long term, control what is done by the devolved institutions. Consequently, it is this place that will always be blamed for cuts. They will always be somebody else's fault, like all the other dreadful things that I have heard about during the past 26 years in the House, but we need at least to have clear lines of demarcation and some means of acquiring the information that Members of Parliament need to seek from time to time. Despite what has been said today, I am not sure whether we have yet reached that happy position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>1.17 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a useful debate in which a number of important issues have been raised. I shall undertake to write to hon. Members on any matters with which I do not manage to deal in the time that is available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the hon. Member for Solihull for the general support that he gave to the Government's approach. Sometimes, there have been slight wobbles—if I may describe them as such—between the Government and the Opposition on certain aspects of the implementation of the Good Friday agreement. As the hon. Gentleman will acknowledge, however, we have
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0637">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
worked hard to maintain bipartisan support for our approach. We appreciate that support has, for the most part, been given willingly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Member for Upper Bann said that devolution was fragile. If he says that that is the case, it is, by definition. Towards the end of his speech, he struck a cautiously optimistic note. He clearly still has faith in the process and will work hard to get through the many difficulties ahead, some of which were referred to subsequently. We share the ambition that the fragile state of devolution will turn into a robust and long-lasting series of arrangements and institutions. Interestingly, the right hon. Gentleman went on to talk about the characteristics of previous Stormont arrangements. I do not want to enter into a discussion of that matter, not least because my knowledge of that piece of history is probably not as great as his. He continued by talking about the origin of the Labour party's decision not to organise or to put up candidates in Northern Ireland. The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that there are occasions on which we elected politicians are highly cautious about speaking on behalf of the organisations that sponsor us. I know that he must be cautious with his party on some matters. I am sure that he will forgive me if I do not enter into a protracted discussion of my party's future or past positions on the issue, except to say that, as he is aware, there is a constitutional difficulty for us in so far as we are affiliated to the same international body as the Social Democratic and Labour party.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There is no difficulty whatever because it is common for countries to be represented by more than one party in international bodies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The right hon. Gentleman will forgive me if I speak on behalf of my party. My understanding is that we consider the situation to be as I have stated it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Trimble</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No other party in Europe concurs.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That might be the case, but we have taken that position, which is considered and honourable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the joint ministerial councils in a supportive way. He, I and Bairbre de Brún sit on the health ministerial council, which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister chairs. No one is trying to say that Northern Ireland, Scotland or Wales must go down a particular route. The spirit is one of asking what lessons and general principles we can learn from each other and how those principles might be applied to the particular problems in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. The right hon. Member for Upper Bann is right to note that the development is useful and that we can all benefit from it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman also mentioned the Barnett formula. I am aware that there are on-going discussions between the Northern Ireland Executive Committee and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been taking an interest in the matter. I hope that
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
the concerns of the right hon. Member for Upper Bann about the Barnett formula on behalf of the Executive Committee can be addressed in due course. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will keep an eye on the issue, as it is his responsibility.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde mentioned a couple of points that I will answer for the record, since he is not in Committee. First, he asked whether the British-Irish Council would have a permanent secretariat and where it would be based. As far as I am aware, there are no plans to establish a permanent secretariat and, therefore, no plans to establish a permanent headquarters for it. The venue of the meetings rotates between England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Dublin, as is appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, my hon. Friend expressed the hope that the Assembly would consider the reform of local government. I hope that he will forgive me, but it is for the Assembly to address local government issues. There is a debate about the future of local government in Northern Ireland. That is the Assembly's prerogative and for me to pontificate on the subject is probably inappropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sorry to have missed a small part of the speech of the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire. I had to leave the Room briefly. However, although he may on occasions have strayed slightly from the subject, he maintained the genial tone that one expects from him. I want to acknowledge the support that he has given for what we are trying to do on several fronts and to say how pleased I was the other week to meet his mother. She seems to have met quite a few members of the Committee during her brief stay at the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for North Down restated his opposition to the principle of devolution, or at least his persistent opposition to the arrangements now in place in Northern Ireland. I regret, although I am not surprised, that the hon. and learned Gentleman is no longer in his seat, but while he is perfectly entitled to make the criticism that he did, he should also offer a viable alternative. He should be able to tell the Committee how he would obtain cross-community support for arrangements applicable to Northern Ireland in the future. On this occasion, as in the past, he conspicuously failed to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lagan Valley stated his position clearly. It is a complex and often misunderstood position, but he made some useful points. He said that the IRA had some way yet to travel to establish the necessary confidence. That is right. Despite the welcome for the statement that has been made and the confidence-building measure, no one can argue that the end of the road has been reached. No one can be certain what route future developments will take. However, there are good reasons to believe that a change has taken place and that we may be cautiously optimistic about journeying further down that road. The hon. Gentleman is right, however, to emphasise that the issue is not
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0638">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
straightforward. It cannot be put into gift-wrapping paper and treated as the end of the matter. It clearly is not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman is also right to emphasise, which we often forget to do, that paramilitaries are not the exclusive property of republicanism. Events of the past few days have shown all too clearly that loyalist paramilitary activity still causes difficulties and is not always clearly under political direction. It takes on a life of its own. That is a serious problem that needs to be dealt with. Some of the self-appointed leaders need to work out what exactly they think they are involved in.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I realise that time is short and that I shall not be able to cover all the ground, but I want to deal with a point that has been raised several times and was covered by the hon. Member for East Londonderry, about arrangements involving this House and the activities of the Assembly and who answers questions on what. It is early days. Discussions are taking place between the Executive and the Northern Ireland Office. Some resolution of the problems is needed in the House. However, I shall think about the points that the hon. Gentleman raised and I know that the right hon. Member for Upper Bann will do so too. I hope that it will be possible for those concerns to be reflected in the procedures of the House in due course. I do not know what eventual arrangements will be made and I recognise that Members of this House are rightly jealous of certain issues, which need to be accommodated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The debate has been a good one and I am glad to say that all the participants, albeit in different ways, wished devolution well and, even with all their reservations, hoped that good would come of it. I hope so too, and believe that there is no lack of good will in this House for the process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<i>Motion made, and Question proposed,</i> That the Committee do now adjourn.—[	<i>Mr. Dowd.</i>]</p>
	<p>1.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I seem to have drawn the long and the short straw today. For today's Adjournment debate, I have chosen the subject of terrorist weapons in Northern Ireland, the use thereof and the threat that their continued existence poses to the community. The number of terrorist weapons and the intentions of those who hold them are questions that have long occupied the minds of the people who live there, who are threatened by their existence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State will have received security and intelligence briefings that spell out the best estimate of the number and type of weapons and explosives held by the various terrorist organisations. In addition, he will have been well briefed by security advisers on the number of active members of the various organised groups, the structure of those groups and the names of many of the leading personalities, some of whom have been very evident in the past day or two. He is therefore under no illusion as to the dangers inherent in the present situation. Neither can he doubt the dangers inherent in the terrorist organisations continuing in possession of their weaponry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Weapons and the objectives of those who hold them cannot be considered in isolation. They hang together, and those who try to separate intention from possession, or from people's willingness to use them to forward their objectives, delude themselves.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IRA holds its weapons in order to forward its political and, more specifically, its constitutional objectives. The loyalists, at least in theory, hold theirs to frustrate those objectives—but many have ideas of their own. In addition, those groups use their weapons to force people to do things that they are not anxious to do or are even opposed to doing. The old communist principle, which was articulated most clearly in China, that shooting one person dead would frighten 1,000 more, is very much part of the scene in Northern Ireland. What the Committee has heard today should make plain to the Government and all who care to listen exactly how serious the turf war is in Northern Ireland between the various military terrorist factions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State told the people of Northern Ireland yesterday that the RUC would be given every power that it needed to deal with violent elements. Given the early release of those who cause the violence, however, his lack of understanding of cause and consequence was mind-boggling. People were on the streets in Drumcree and elsewhere, and they were fomenting strife in north Belfast 10 days ago; I think that their identity is well known to the Government. It was an astonishing statement for the Secretary of State to make.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The right hon. Gentleman knows very well that terrorist groups use firearms to threaten, mutilate and murder as a means of imposing their will on many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0639">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>47</span>
urban areas in Northern Ireland. He knows that those activities are now extending to the smaller towns and even to rural areas. Indeed, from the long series of questions that I have asked, he will know that the use of firearms is a matter-of-fact method of injury. Even when clubs, baseball bats and breeze-blocks are the instruments of injury, I have no doubt that firearms are to be found in the background.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The answers to the questions that I have asked on the subject make it plain that the RUC can easily and quickly attribute responsibility for the vast majority of those crimes in a few days—sometimes hours or even minutes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That capacity reflects well on the abilities of the security forces in Northern Ireland, because it shows how well they are on top of things with respect to general intelligence and how deeply they have infiltrated the organisations responsible, despite the danger to the infiltrators. It is equally clear that the assessment of who is responsible is a matter of police intelligence and not of proof. If it were a matter of proof, the individuals would be before the courts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The intelligence is clearly good enough to determine who is responsible for the mutilations, beatings and gunshot woundings and to enable the Chief Constable to say with some confidence that the recent bomb attack on the railway was the work of dissident republicans. It was good enough to enable him to forecast trouble at Drumcree by extreme loyalists. Regrettably, however, the intelligence seems to fall down in several respects. For example, the Chief Constable is unable, several weeks after the event, to say which organisation shot Ed McCoy. Likewise, he cannot yet tell us the allegiance of the persons injured in the bomb explosion in the garden shed in Andersonstown. In the latter case, there are reports that the persons concerned are an IRA family and it is widely believed that the murderers of Mr. McCoy were part of that organisation. Indeed, I understand from some sources that the dissident groups were making it clear to all who would listen at recent meetings that the folk who were playing around with the bomb in the garden shed were not part of their organisation. That was a Provo family. In what now appears as the misty past, Mr. Michael Collins was bludgeoned to death: again, no claim and no blame. His punishment—death—was of course for telling the truth about Irish republicanism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In none of the cases that I mentioned has the Chief Constable found it possible—unfortunately, a great many people in Northern Ireland think that he has not found it expedient—to state that the provisional IRA were the folk who killed. That is due to the possible implications for the release of prisoners, for weapons, for membership of the Executive, and the rest. If the Chief Constable and the Minister can tell me who beat up or knee-capped whom, they can surely point the finger at the people who are responsible for those far more serious crimes. It was always possible, during the worst days of violence, to tell which terrorist organisations were responsible for murder.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>48</span>
Many in Northern Ireland believe that the real reason for the failure to point the finger of blame is simply that murder and engagement with bombs fall outside the IRA definition of cessation of violence. If that were admitted, the Secretary of State would have to take action on the release of prisoners and on whether Sinn Fein-IRA members should remain in the Northern Ireland Executive. I hope that that is not the reason for avoiding pointing the finger of blame, but everyone in Northern Ireland thinks that it is.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The inspection of some IRA arms dumps by Mr. Ahtisaari and Mr. Ramaphosa is being hailed as a major breakthrough. The public do not know the location of the dumps, the material within them, the means of securing them and even whether they are real dumps or structures dressed up to appear as long-term arms stores. Also, leading members of the IRA have said that no weapons will ever be given up. That statement came from the individual who is supposed to be in charge of the weapons. All the weapons remain in the control of the IRA and even if they are double-locked, access can be obtained to them. The dumps are not Fort Knox. To be blunt, the dumps could be emptied at any time—unless, of course, the Government of the Republic, or our intelligence services, have located them and are prepared to stop any movement of weapons. That is rather difficult for our people, since most of the sites are deep in the Republic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Dublin authorities know where the dumps are—unless they are more incompetent than I give them credit for, they do—they should, under their laws, seize the weapons. Not to do so is to treat the IRA as an equal partner and to accept to some extent its claim to be the real Government of the Irish republic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The IRA's weapons, while they remain in the hands of the terrorist organisation, are a permanent silent threat. Silent weapons do not cease to be a threat—they remain a threat because they are there to be used. They add muscle to the pressure that the IRA can exert on the Government and on the public. Loyalist weapons, presumably all hidden in Northern Ireland, are a threat to those who live in areas dominated by loyalist organisations. These large armouries make it certain that a truly normal life in Northern Ireland is impossible and will stay impossible while they remain in terrorist hands. Those who hold them use them, if only as a silent threat to procure the changes in the constitution that they seek. That has been the real reason for all IRA activity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The only response of a Government committed to the restoration of normal society in the Province should be to seek out that weaponry and to destroy it. The policy of no guns, no government had a sound foundation in logic. We have moved far too far from that position in an effort to wean people away from terrorism. My firm opinion is that the policy of appeasement feeds terrorism and enables terrorist leaders to say how far they have come to their goal without having given up a single bullet.

The IRA's present activity—or lack of activity—simply follows its original long-standing concept, which emerged in the 1960s, that its campaign should be a perfect blend of violence and politics. That is what it has been throughout the past 30 to 35 years. That IRA policy was expressed more recently by Danny Morrison as an armalite in one hand and a ballot paper in another. The IRA understands that armalites need not be fired for them to be effective, any more than bombs need be exploded. The Government's actions have vindicated the IRA's theories. The Secretary of State's threats, when he blustered about taking action against those who held on to arms, sounded hollow to the IRA and to all other terrorist organisations. The bluff of the Secretary of State will be called by the terrorist organisations until he acts rather than talks. He will not be believed by anyone in Northern Ireland until then.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) for raising the important issue of terrorist weapons in Northern Ireland. I will endeavour to answer as many of his points as I can in the time available to me. I hope that I can at least provide him with information, even if we cannot agree on every point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Two points arise from the hon. Gentleman's speech. First, as he knows, we never comment on intelligence information for the simple reason that it would cease to be of value if it became public knowledge. It is right to say that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State keeps security under constant review. A decision to specify is taken in the round, as the hon. Gentleman also knows, according to factors set out in statute. We do not believe that any group has decided to end its ceasefire, but we constantly review the situation with security advisers and continue to judge whether organisations are maintaining unequivocal ceasefires based on the statutory criteria. We do not dip in and out of the matter; rather, it is on-going.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate many of the hon. Gentleman's concerns and I accept that he is not alone in holding them. However, he has painted a somewhat monochrome picture of the situation in Northern Ireland. Resolving the issue of illegally held arms is crucial, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, to the long-term peace and stability of Northern Ireland. The history of peace negotiations and of our efforts to implement the Good Friday agreement illustrate all too clearly that decommissioning of all paramilitary weapons, from wherever they come, is paramount to achieving any sort of peaceful solution. We have, however, made significant progress. The agreement committed all of those who signed it to securing the decommissioning of paramilitary arms.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister referred to all of those who signed the agreement. How many signed it? Will he provide a list?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>50</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The signatories to the agreement were the pro-agreement parties—the hon. Gentleman is aware of all of them—and the two Governments. I do not think that anybody else was involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Arms Decommissioning Act 1997 and the consequent decommissioning scheme set out a framework for decommissioning. The Independent International Commission on Decommissioning was established to oversee and verify the process. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the commission is engaged in dialogue on ceasefire with all the paramilitary groups. The main groups have been on ceasefire for some considerable time and remain so. I mentioned that the ceasefire was kept under review. Although its status has sometimes been shaky, we cannot fail to recognise the real benefits that the reduction of terrorist activity has brought to every part of Northern Ireland, notwithstanding the current difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is fair to say that progress on decommissioning has not happened as quickly as we would have liked, and that progress on the implementation of the strand 1 provisions in the Belfast agreement—the constitutional settlement—has consequently stalled on a number of occasions. Perhaps the most serious of those problems was the suspension of the new institution. After the justifiable euphoria of Good Friday 1998, it was hugely disappointing and frustrating that progress could not be made more quickly on implementing the two key aspects of the Belfast agreement—decommissioning and devolution. It was clear that those issues had to be tackled head on and that significant movement was needed on decommissioning if devolution was to be restored on a lasting basis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We now have assurances that the IRA is committed to pursuing its political aims by exclusively peaceful means. The statement that it issued on 6 May gave precisely the sort of commitments that Unionists have been seeking for a long time. It stated its commitment to non-violence and undertook to initiate a process to put its arms completely and verifiably beyond use. The hon. Gentleman will know that that terminology is recognised by the Decommissioning Act as constituting actual decommissioning. As a gesture of good faith, the IRA undertook in addition to carry out an early confidence-building measure. For the first time ever, it agreed to make its arms caches available to independent inspection, which was an unprecedented move.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee will be aware that the IRA's commitment on that last point has now been honoured. On 26 June, the Independent International Decommissioning Commission published a report by the inspectors, Cyril Ramaphosa and President Ahtisaari, confirming that they had inspected a number of arms dumps that contained a large number of weapons. They confirmed that the weapons were secure and that they could not be accessed without detection. They said that they would inspect the dumps regularly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1999-2000V010P0I0641">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>51</span>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned the inspectors. I can reassure him that Cyril Ramaposa and President Attisaari are men of international standing. They are very credible. Neither would add his name to the report unless he was satisfied that the commitment was real. More precise details would provide a standing temptation to the dissident groups. No one wants weapons to fall into their hands. It is for the independent inspectors to assess the significance and credibility of the confidence-building measure. They are satisfied by the genuineness of the IRA's intention, as is the Decommissioning Commission. We cannot ask for more than that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked about signatories to the Good Friday agreement. No one signed the agreement as such, which is, I think, what he was driving at. However, all pro-agreement parties and the two Government parties are signed up to it. The first line of the declaration of support on page 1 of the agreement states:
	<br><blockquote><p>We the participants in the multi-party negotiations—</p></blockquote>
and goes on to say in paragraph 4—
	<br><blockquote><p>reaffirm our total and absolute commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means.</p></blockquote>
The hon. Gentleman should accept that assurance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Decommissioning is back on track. There is every reason to be cautiously optimistic about the prospects for progress, yet some people seek to undermine those achievements. There have been objections that the confidence-building measure is not actual decommissioning. I agree—it is not. The Government have never maintained that the confidence-building measure is a substitute for decommissioning and neither, to be fair, has the IRA. Decommissioning remains our ultimate goal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other opponents have criticised our optimism and argued that there is a long way to go. Again, I would have to agree, and I think I have said as much. This is
	<span class='label label-info column'>52</span>
only the beginning of a process that we hope will end—we are increasingly confident that it will—in the decommissioning of paramilitary arms. I understand that everyone wants to know when decommissioning will be achieved and the gun taken out of Northern Ireland for good but, as I said earlier, we know from experience that setting deadlines is unhelpful. If we impose time scales within the overall time frame, they could have the opposite effect to that intended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not understand how recent events and developments could possibly mean that the suggestion that we should plan for failure is well founded. That is not the case. Of course we must maintain the momentum, but we also have to give time for the new political settlement to establish itself and for the positive aspects of devolution and the continuing implementation of the agreement to have an effect. Politics will be shown to work. I am cautiously confident that progress will continue to be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know the hon. Gentleman will join me in condemning all acts of violence, which, frankly, have no place in a modern democratic society. I cannot stress strongly enough—I realise he seeks this reassurance—that the Government's commitment to detecting the perpetrators of such atrocities and bringing them to justice is absolute, and that the Chief Constable will get all the support that we are able to give him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is vigilant. Regular contact with the Chief Constable ensures that security levels are commensurate with the level of threat that exists at any given time. We should be encouraged by the fact that the threat has declined in the past few years. The processes that are in hand, the agreements that are in place and the process that is under way give me every confidence that that trend will continue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
