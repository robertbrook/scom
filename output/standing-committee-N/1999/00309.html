	<p>2.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The only business before the Committee is the debate on the draft Appropriation (Northern Ireland) Order 2000, which may continue for up to three hours. I have no powers to restrict speeches. Nevertheless, I implore colleagues to make short speeches so that everyone who wants to speak may do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><q><p>That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the draft Appropriation (Northern Ireland) Order 2000.</p></q>
Details of the sums sought are given in the spring supplementary estimates booklet and the statement of sums required on account, which have been placed in the Library and are available from the Vote Office. I regret that the order is being considered here by such a process instead of by locally elected representatives in the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, while we await the restoration of the Assembly, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and I are responsible for seeing that good government is maintained. We must, therefore, once again seek Parliament's approval for the detailed appropriation of funds for key public services. That should be one of the Assembly's most important tasks. Indeed, it was about to undertake it for the first time when suspension began. I hope that it will not be too long before the Assembly is permanently restored and the benefits of a devolved administration are fully realised by all the people of Northern Ireland and, indeed, elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order has two purposes, the first being to authorise expenditure of £193 million in the 1999–2000 spring supplementary estimates. Before suspension, the Northern Ireland Executive Committee reviewed the spending plans for the current year and made a series of adjustments, resulting in revised allocations for various services. That is reflected in the supplementary estimates: there have been no changes since suspension.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the order is approved, it will bring the total estimates provision for Northern Ireland departmental services to £7,595 million for the current financial year. The order's second purpose is to authorise a vote on account of £3,539 million for the next financial year. That has been generally calculated as 45 per cent. of the anticipated net 2000–01 main estimates provisions in the budget which was agreed by the Executive and presented to the Assembly last December. That will enable the services of Northern Ireland departments to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>4</span>
continue until the 2000–01 main estimates are approved—hopefully, later this year by the Assembly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly was in the process of scrutinising budget proposals for the forthcoming financial year when it was suspended. One of its key tasks is consideration of the annual budget, which it has the right to modify. If the Committee approves the vote on account today, it will not necessarily pre-empt the Assembly's decision on final allocations for the next financial year, as less than half the total proposed budget is being sought in the draft order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, budget holders in the health service, schools and all other key public services must plan and commit resources now if they are to discharge their responsibilities properly. At present, they are working with the Executive's budget proposals on a provisional basis, as will continue to be the case. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State currently has no plans to alter the outline budget. The longer that restoration is delayed, the less opportunity there is for the Assembly to modify spending plans, as resources will, in effect, have been allocated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I expect our debate to be comprehensive and wide-ranging. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and I will cover as many points as we can and any that we cannot cover will be followed up in the usual way by writing to members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to make two points before turning to the details of the estimates. First, I must advise the Committee that we cannot account for policy decisions that were taken by the Executive Committee and its members during devolution. That remains a matter for them and not for my hon. Friend and I. Secondly, I remind the Committee that the draft order does not—I repeat, does not—cover expenditure by the Northern Ireland Office on law and order and other services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Under those estimates, there is a district rate, part of which relates to the police. Is that correct? If it is, can we talk about the police?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Usually, what can or cannot be dealt with in Committee rests with the Chair.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I was about to intervene on the hon. Gentleman. He is right. Yes, there is a district rate and it does refer to the police. But the order refers to central Government expenditure in Northern Ireland, not to local government expenditure. It is not in order, therefore, to discuss the police or security services.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam. For the benefit of the Committee, local government expenditure does not cover policing in Northern Ireland. It is a matter for central Government and that may alter your view.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am well aware of that, but local taxation is certainly not part of the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful for your ruling, Mr. McWilliam, but knowing the ingenuity of Opposition Members, they will find some way in which to weave in issues that are relevant to them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0567">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. If members of the Committee try to weave in something that is out of order, I shall tell them that they are out of order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I fully appreciate that, Mr. McWilliam. I was about to finish my sentence by saying that such members of the Committee would be subject to your strict scrutiny. I am sure that if I deviate from the order, I shall be sharply brought into order, if not by you, Mr. McWilliam, then by Opposition Members.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall try to keep my comments about the spring supplementary estimates as brief as possible to give other members of the Committee the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Full details of the many changes to which I shall be referring are contained in the spring supplementary estimates booklets that have been provided to members of the Committee. To help them in their consideration, I shall refer to the relevant page numbers as I proceed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On a technical point, some of the votes seek token increases only because new pressures have been offset by equivalent reduced requirements elsewhere in the same votes. I refer now to the estimates. In vote 1 on pages 5 to 7 of the estimates booklet, which provides for Northern Ireland expenditure on United Kingdom-wide agriculture support measures, a net addition of £10.5 million is sought. That is an example of how the Government have responded positively to special circumstances. It includes £8.5 million in respect of the special aid package payable under the hill livestock compensatory allowance and £2 million to cover higher than anticipated demand for the environmentally sensitive areas scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A further £4.1 million is in respect of agri-monetary compensation for the beef sector and £3.5 million is for hill livestock compensatory allowances. Agri-monetary compensation is designed to offset the effects of currency appreciation on agricultural support prices and compensation payments that are set in euros.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In vote 2 on pages 8 to 13, covering local agricultural support measures, a net increase of £5.4 million is sought. That includes £10.2 million in respect of controlling outbreaks of animal diseases, including tuberculosis and brucellosis. The additions are offset partially by reduced requirements elsewhere within the vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Token increases of £1,000 are sought in votes 3, 4 and 5, which cover economic development and training. In vote 3, on pages 14 to 16, £13.3 million is sought by the Industrial Development Board to meet pressures on industrial development grants from increased claims from client companies. A further £1 million is sought for industrial development promotion to allow the board to build on the success of its overseas marketing campaign and to maintain the momentum of promoting Northern Ireland as a good and competitive investment location. Those increases are offset by reduced requirements and additional receipts elsewhere in the vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A token £1,000 is also sought in vote 4, which is on pages 17 to 22. In that vote, which covers other economic support measures, administration, energy and miscellaneous services, increased requirements are
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>6</span>
offset by savings elsewhere. Additions sought include £500,000 to assist with the setting up costs associated with the new Equality Commission and to meet pressures on the Office of the Industrial and Fair Employment Tribunals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In vote 5, on pages 23 to 26, covering the Training and Employment Agency, a token increase of £1,000 is sought. As in vote 4, reduced requirements and additional receipts will offset those increases. The adjustments include a redistribution of resources under the new deal to meet changing demands and pressures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In vote 7, on pages 28 to 34, covering expenditure on roads, transport and ports, a net increase of £1 million is sought. The main increases are £6 million for roads maintenance and £2 million for capital expenditure on the vehicle information system of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. There is also increased provision of £1.9 million for Northern Ireland Railways and £900,000 for works at St. Angelo airport in Fermanagh, as well as an additional £7.9 million for current expenditure on the Roads Service. Those increases are largely offset by a reduction in capital spending on roads and increased receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In vote 9, covering the Water Service and related services on pages 34 and 35, a net increase of £3 million is sought, mainly in respect of running costs for the Water Service that have been brought forward from 1998–99 under the end year flexibility arrangements.

A net increase of £8 million is sought in vote 10 on pages 36 to 42. Included in that increase is a further £1.6 million for expenditure on urban regeneration and £600,000 to assist Omagh district council with costs incurred following the tragic bombing in 1998, as well as additional running costs brought forward from 1998–99 under end year flexibility arrangements. Those increases are partially offset by additional receipts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In vote 11, on pages 43 and 44, an increase of £1 million is sought for fire services, reflecting the carry forward of underspend in 1998–99. In vote 12, on pages 45 to 53, covering expenditure on education and related services, a net increase of £53 million is sought. That is mainly due to a £70 million reduction in receipts, previously forecast because the third UK sale of student loan debt was not proceeded with. The Treasury has made good the resulting deficit from the reserve, so there is no loss to public services in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, there are increases of £33.9 million for school and library books; £3.5 million for school and further education maintenance; £2.8 million for tuition fees and grants to students; and £2.6 million for the Odyssey Millennium Landmark project. Those increases are partially offset by reduced requirements of £11 million on student loans and £4.5 million on the European Union peace and reconciliation programme.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That could perhaps be dealt with in detail during winding-up speech, but it basically relates to the two-year allocation of moneys that were calculated for that purpose and the fact that one term in the estimates, which was expected to be paid, was not required. The figure was five instead of six, and a reduction flows from that. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary could take the Committee through the student loan element of the estimates in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In vote 14 on pages 54 to 58, a net increase of £58.6 million is sought for expenditure on hospital, community health and personal social services, health and social services trusts, family health services and certain other services. That includes £23.9 million carried forward from 1998–99 under end year flexibility arrangements, £20.3 million towards winter and other pressures, £9.4 million for capital expenditure and £5 million for the meningitis vaccine programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Votes 16 and 17 also cover health and social services expenditure. In vote 16 on pages 61 to 63, additional net provision of £9.1 million is sought for expenditure on certain miscellaneous health and personal social services costs. That includes £8.5 million for the European Union peace and reconciliation programme and £0.4 million for grants to community groups funded by the European regional development fund. Additional net provision of £10.5 million is sought in vote 17 on pages 64 to 68 to meet administration and other miscellaneous costs. That includes £12.3 million to fund running cost, capital and other administration pressures. The increases are offset by an overall increase in receipts of £1.8 million, mainly from the department of social security, for administering certain services on its behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vote 19 on pages 69 to 71 covers social security, which is centrally administered. In it, £12.9 million is sought mainly to meet higher than anticipated expenditure on housing benefit and increased payments into the Northern Ireland national insurance fund in respect of statutory sick and statutory maternity payments. Those increased requirements are offset by reduced ones elsewhere in the vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: How have the Government calculated what might be required to deal with men over 60 who are entitled to winter fuel allowances arising from the decision in Europe?

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the Committee will give me some latitude in not responding to that in detail. That question about a precise allocation of one element of the estimates would perhaps be better dealt with by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary when he sums up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, there is also additional provision of £4.4 million for the Northern Ireland Assembly on pages 79 and 80. That increase is to allow the Assembly to begin to implement the recommendations of the Assembly Commission. It examined the resources that the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>8</span>
Assembly will require in order to discharge its functions fully.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I must advise the Committee, however, that during suspension the Northern Ireland Act 2000 requires that the cost of the Assembly is met directly from a Northern Ireland Office vote. That is put before the House as part of the approval process for UK supply estimates, and, is a completely separate procedure from today's business.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Andrew Robathan 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Blaby)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I have not been following matters as closely as I could, given that the Assembly has been suspended. Are its Members still being paid?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, at the reduced rate that they were paid before they took on their responsibilities as fully functioning Members of the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robathan</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: With the suspension, does the Minister agree that Members of the Assembly are doing no work? One can understand why the Assembly might require a shadow establishment of civil servants, who I am sure are working, but what reason can there be for the British taxpayer voting more than £3 million extra to the Assembly when its Members are not working?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: First, United Kingdom taxpayers are contributing, not British taxpayers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hear noises off about the difference between the UK and Britain, but this is not the right forum in which to debate that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I ask the Minister to return to the estimates, as we are dealing purely with the appropriation order, not the semantics of what is Britain and what is the UK.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I should have liked to have done so. I am glad that we are not debating this elsewhere, but I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman looked so quizzical about what I said, as there were sound reasons behind it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Legislative Assembly—the MLAs—are still carrying out constituency work: they still write to Ministers, deal with their constituents' problems and represent constituency interests. I do not understand the purpose behind the suggestion that we should not pay them. That would effectively wind up the Assembly and there would then be no representative body in any shape or form.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman shakes his head, but I do not know whether I can respond to that approach. Judgments have been made and lessons learnt. First, there was an overwhelming vote by the people of Northern Ireland in favour of the Belfast agreement. People were elected to represent different areas and work in partnership with local councils, Members of Parliament and MEPs. That extended the basis of democratic representation within Northern Ireland. While we are in the process of trying to restore that Assembly, it is appropriate that these people continue in office. I must also remind the hon.

Gentleman that that is what was approved by Parliament.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am interested to hear that Members' salaries have been reduced already. I was not aware of that. Was a regulation passed to that effect?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Act passed by this Parliament gave power to the Secretary of State to act in that way and he carried out his powers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strangford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister recognise the increasing public concern in Northern Ireland about the payment of salaries at the full level? All powers have been transferred from Stormont to the Westminster Parliament and no committees are taking place. That has caused anxiety. Will the Minister confirm whether salaries will continue indefinitely?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Before the Minister gets to his feet, there is a high level of extraneous conversation in Committee and I should like to hear the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will agree that the best answer is the reinstatement and full functioning of the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Not in present circumstances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, that is a matter to be debated elsewhere. I accept the right hon. Gentleman's point about how this is viewed in Northern Ireland, but the decision to maintain MLAs was approved by an Act of Parliament. The Secretary of State exercised his powers in setting salaries. All considerations must now be taken into account as we move forward through the process. The Government's objective—and I hope that the right hon. Gentleman would support it—is to have the Assembly restored and to get it functioning fully again. That is our understanding of the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland. All the parties are currently engaged in trying to find a way forward out of the current difficulties.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would wish to see the reinstatement of the Executive and the Assembly only on the basis of full implementation of the Belfast agreement—and I see no likelihood of that in the foreseeable future. In those circumstances, will the Minister confirm that it is impossible to reduce the salaries of MLAs until the Assembly is abolished?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It would be inappropriate for me to respond in detail about the legality of that, although it may dealt with in the summing up. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the restoration of the Assembly in line with the full implementation of the Belfast agreement. We share that point of view: that is precisely what the Government have always sought and will continue to try to achieve. We are doing so in our present discussions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I correct in saying that the salary of Members of the legislative Assembly of Northern Ireland who were not elected representatives to any other body was originally about £29,000 and that, as one of its first acts, the Assembly voted for an additional £10,000, which increased that salary to about £39,000? When the Minister refers to a reduced salary, does he mean
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>10</span>
taking away the additional £10,000 that the Members voted themselves during their brief period in power?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am not going to comment on how the Assembly exercises its power. That is a matter for the devolved Administration. We as Members of Parliament recently approved a rise for ourselves, too. The hon. and learned Gentleman is right about what took place when the Assembly was up and running, and I thought that I had dealt with that point earlier.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the Minister, but when the Members were receiving £29,000 a year many were serving on committees that dealt with procedure and business. Now, however, they are doing absolutely nothing in the Assembly or on committees.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that point. At the moment, we are dealing with an undesirable environment. It is not what we wanted. We wanted the Assembly to continue. I would be stretching the debate if I discussed the ramifications of what happened in February and the run-up to that. I am sure that the Secretary of State is fully cognisant of that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to the point made earlier by the hon. and learned Gentleman's colleague—I do not know whether the right hon. Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor) is a colleague, but he may wish to be in the context of this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are all colleagues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I never know who in the pack assembled opposite are colleagues.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I answered the point about why the decision was made, and I hope that the current circumstances will not continue for long. The arrangement will continue until the suspension is lifted, at which time the Assembly will revert to receiving its funding through the order. We have had to provide for the Assembly in the order to facilitate a speedy return to devolution.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My right hon. Friend the Minister may like to point out to Opposition Members who have intervened that we are paid salaries during the recess, even though the only avenue available to us for getting things done is writing letters to Ministers, which often go unanswered. If people are not going to be paid because they do not have any power, my salary will have to be taken away, too.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister should not respond to that intervention, which does not relate to the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have no intention of responding, and would have avoided doing so.

I have reached a conclusion on the estimates. I have deliberately kept my speech as brief as possible, because hon. Members will want to discuss the details of the estimates and their impact on the good governance of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I may have to leave the Committee briefly during our proceedings. I do not want to encourage speculation, but I may have to deal with matters relating to Harland and Wolff and take advice. We are

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>11</span>
dealing with an evolving picture, as I am sure hon. Members appreciate. I hope to return for the closing speech of my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary and to listen to as many contributions as possible. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I call Mr. Ian Taylor. I apologise—Mr. John M. Taylor.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.59 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have rather a plenitude of Taylors here today. Perhaps I may be permitted to say at the outset that I agree with the Minister that it is a matter of regret that the debate is taking place in this Grand Committee rather than in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Opposition will do nothing to impede the order and I will not speak at any length this afternoon because I have no wish to trespass on the speaking time available to the elected Members of the House who represent Northern Ireland constituencies. They will hardly need me to dilate upon the very real problems that exist in Northern Ireland in agriculture, fishing and shipbuilding to name but three sectors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Northern Ireland need stability in their political, social and economic affairs. Having said that, I acknowledge that this is not the time or place for me to rehearse my party's misgivings about prisoner release, decommissioning or the prospects for the Royal Ulster Constabulary. It is better for me to wish that these appropriations be well spent and efficiently used, not least on those infrastructure projects that will keep the economy of Northern Ireland moving.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope, Mr. McWilliam, that I have met your stricture to speak briefly. I have a confession to make that I shared with you and the Ministers and with the representative of the Patronage Secretary who is here today. I have a long-standing engagement in the midlands this evening and I may not be able to stay to the conclusion of the Committee's deliberations. I mean no discourtesy either to you, Mr. McWilliam, to the Ministers or to the Committee as a whole. I will make it my business to read 	<i>Hansard</i> to acquaint myself with the contributions of other right hon. and hon. Members.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.1 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that the Minister may have to go. I do not know whether he can bring us word that the quay can be laid in the near future, but it will be good news for many people in Northern Ireland. We appreciate the problem, which I raised during business questions in the Chamber earlier.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise the issue of winter fuel. The Minister said that it was a detailed question but I have pressed the matter for some time. There are difficulties that occur at times between Departments here and in Northern Ireland. For example, some of us recognise that social security is a United Kingdom issue. We raise a matter with the main Department and sometimes it is transferred to the department in
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>12</span>
Northern Ireland. I have got into the habit recently of sending copies. If it is a specific issue for the Northern Ireland Minister I send a copy to the main Department and vice versa. There seems to be confusion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In that context I trust that there will be an opportunity to tell us how far within the Northern Ireland context discussions have progressed that will allow a reform of the procedures whereby a person who happens to be in respite care in the week of 20 September is disallowed winter fuel allowance when he needs it. It is sometimes said that we have a bad climate in the United Kingdom, but September is still usually reasonably mild. That is not the time to penalise people when they require it in the middle of winter. Another issue is that the Department could not give the front desk people in Northern Ireland and, I dare say, in other parts of the United Kingdom, the information that is required to deal with the inquiries that have come in. I trust that enough money has been left aside. I know that there is a promise that it will be backdated for two years. One wonders whether that will be new money allocated in the next financial year or if it will be carried over from the current financial year to cover the back payments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of vote 9 in the Department for Regional Development and the issue of the water supply, are the Ministers satisfied that enough finance has been made available to deal with this chronic problem? My concerns are about health. Over the years, the health of the nation improved as a result of improved water rather than medical provision. I am not criticising the medical profession. As has often been the case, environmental developments have done more to improve the health of the nation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many of the mains, particular in the city of Belfast, were laid in the Victorian era, and the water service now needs substantial funding to upgrade the pipes to a modern standard. Some of us will have to live with that over the coming years as the roads are dug up in Belfast and elsewhere. It is as bad as painting the Forth bridge. Many old pipes are prone to bursting, and leakage is responsible for a considerable waste of resources. Many of the leakage problems were dealt with some years ago. However, some in the Department believe that it is much more expensive to try to deal with the leaks than to let the system leak. That issue will have to be addressed sooner or later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A problem that affects our health even more is the fact that many of the older pipes are made of lead or cast iron: some laid during the war are made of asbestos. For many years, Belfast regulations dictated that even when the pipes were copper they had to be attached to the mains by a length of lead. Lead pipes were laid right up until the 1960s, as I think my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) would agree.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With lead piping there is the problem of leaching, whereby lead deposits get into the drinking water supply and can be particularly harmful to children. Public policy has recently focused on the removal of lead from the environment—from petrol and from lead shot. Hence the water industry has embraced the use of modern piping made from plastic or safe metals.
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0571">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>13</span>
However, many of our estates in Belfast—and, I suspect, in other parts of the province—still have a health hazard that needs to be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Not only have we the problem of lead in our water supplies, but there is also the problem of aluminium—or, as our Canadian and American friends say, aluminum. It is the third most common element in the earth's crust, and it may be present in water supplies as an active constituent owing to the nature and structure of the ground from which the water supply is taken.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Water Service is required to provide water of a quality that conforms to the Water Quality Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1994 and the regulations incorporated in the requirements of the EC drinking water directive. In 1998, 94.83 per cent. of samples taken complied with the regulations. The Water Service has a comprehensive capital works programme aimed at rectifying areas where water quality does not comply with the regulations. In the past 10 years, the Water Service has spent approximately £120 million on the provision of new and upgraded water treatment plants and plans to spend a further £120 million over the next 10 years. However, there are areas where there is concern that there is too much aluminium in the water and it is affecting young children. This will cause them physical problems as they mature into adults.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to vote 10 and press the Minister on whether he has any more light to shed on Thanksgiving square? That concept has existed for quite a long time. The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport brought people in Northern Ireland together on the issue and asked who would take the lead. An arts official said that she would do so. Months went by and nothing more was heard about it; she finally responded that there was no money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With the suspension of the Assembly we do not know where we stand, but there is also the problem that, with the changing of departmental responsibilities, it is difficult to know which Department is now responsible for the project. The deadline for getting things moving was to have been the end of March. Some people were chained to the notion of going public with an appeal, but without the promised finance from public sources—as distinct from the public at large—they were advised that they could not proceed with an appeal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The project is an important one because it would improve the overall concept of the waterfront area, and would provide a meeting place where people of diverse views could meet and exhibitions could be held. It is to be headed by a committee of responsible people drawn from the spectrum of religious and non-religious bodies. By "religious" I do not mean just Roman Catholic and Protestant—some folks always manage to think of those groups in the context of Northern Ireland—but our Jewish, Hindu and Islamic communities, as well as the atheist and agnostic communities of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to raise another issue under vote 10. I am concerned about what has been happening over the years in the planning service of the Department of the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>14</span>
Environment, Transport and the Regions. Quite a number of major planning decisions have been made that were overturned at judicial review. However, I am more concerned about the impact of such decisions on individual householders.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those involved in the planning service give permission for developments that impinge on neighbours, but tell me that it is not their responsibility to check the deeds. I am not referring merely to the ancient law of lights, but to developments such as one that occurred some years ago in my constituency. A cobbler discovered that a wall built by the Housing Executive, for which planning permission had been granted, blocked the only means of egress from the building in the event of a fire at the front. When we raised the issue we were told that it was just a neighbourly quarrel and that the planning service had merely fulfilled its role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently had a similar experience when I discovered that planning permission had been given for a building in another part of the community, the foundations of which were on a neighbour's property. Again, we were told that the planning permission had prohibited trespassing. I asked what would happen if trespass occurred and I was told that that would constitute a neighbourly dispute. It seems wrong for a Department to wash its hands, Pilate-fashion, and say that neighbour should never go to court against neighbour over a planning issue. The planning authorities should not give anyone permission to trespass on another's property. When the financing of planning authorities is considered, that should be borne in mind, as it may affect the way in which this issue develops.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that several hon. Members wish to speak, but I want to make some points about social work. I cannot speak for the rest of the United Kingdom, but without a shadow of doubt, in Northern Ireland we are imposing on our social workers. We do not have enough workers in the field, and we are relying on people with a sense of commitment to work at home preparing reports. There may be such a thing as time off in lieu, but I know that many of them do not get it—again primarily because of their commitment to their clients and the service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Has the Northern Ireland Office taken into account the views of the British Association of Social Workers (Northern Ireland) on the proposed organisational changes to the structure of health and social services? Can it be given an assurance
	<br><q><p>that any future changes to the existing health and social services structures will continue to meet the social aspects of people's wellbeing as well as those concerned directly with health?</p></q>
While it has been hailed as a wonderful system, we have to admit that acute hospitals dictate most of the terms, and the money is often siphoned off. Over the years, children's services have been penalised as money has been sucked into the acute sector. We must protect our children—to my mind, our greatest heritage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
BASW (Northern Ireland) would also welcome the introduction of a general social care council. Again, however, we are in limbo—though I am not using it as
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0572">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>15</span>
a theological term. Will there be further delay, or can we expedite matters so that the project can go ahead?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What about residential care services? I have learnt over the years that one has to be careful how one asks questions. Civil servants have a wonderful art of using language in a way that is more confusing than the semantic difference between "British" and the "United Kingdom". I cottoned on to the shortage of accommodation for young people who need secure care when the problem came to light through the exposure of a sex ring in Northern Ireland. Hotels engaged in various rackets involving children as young as 13, or perhaps even younger.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I cannot comment on the full details, but I discovered that there are regulations against overcrowding, and that because of inadequate provision for children needing care, one child was taken from a home in north Belfast and put into hotel accommodation. I asked about the cost of that care and was told that it was about £800 or £900. I knew that that was wrong. Once again, I learned that it is not good to ask questions unless one has an idea of the answer. I later asked whether that figure covered the accommodation of the social workers, and found out that it came to more than £9,000. We must look into the problems of adequate provision and funding to ensure that children receive the care that they need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to health issues, we are told that everything in the garden is lovely, but now and again, we get an honest admission that the pressures have been too much. Last week, I received a letter from a constituent, copying a letter that he had sent to the chief executive of the health board, in which he explained that his 14-year-old daughter is suffering from a twisted spine and requires urgent surgery—spinal fusion to correct the deformity. In November 1998, she and her parents were told that the surgery was required urgently. After several consultations, it was decided by the summer of 1999 that her condition was deteriorating and, as there was only a limited window of opportunity for surgical intervention, an operation was quickly scheduled for November 1999—a year after the first interview.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is now towards the end of March 2000, and to cut a long story short, the youngster's operation has been postponed twice. On one occasion she was admitted to hospital but sent home the next day because there was not enough intensive care provision. There had been a crash, and one injury case had meant that the whole hospital—one of the best in the United Kingdom—could not cope. Surely, as we are considering financial matters, we should ask whether enough provision has been made for the health service, or is tremendous waste occurring?

For a long time, I have been concerned about the overall impact of occupational therapy. It has been discovered recently that some people in occupational therapy are still using outmoded methods. Their way of setting priorities is that, as requests come in, they put them to the bottom of the pile. That is not prioritisation; they are simply taking the requests in order, which is not necessarily the right way to deal
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>16</span>
with them. Is not something wrong when it might be four or five months—or in some cases a year—before anything is done after an occupational therapist has finally assessed the home adaptation needs of a person with disability? If we required such adaptations, but were unable to afford them ourselves, we would not find those delays helpful, either mentally or physically. I ask the Minister to consider whether there is adequate occupation therapy provision in terms of person power and finances.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As, I think, Lord Molyneaux said in the other place, agriculture is in crisis, so I am pleased that extra money is being put into supporting agriculture in Northern Ireland. The money is being spent tactically; it will help to tide agriculture over in the short term. That is fine so long as agriculture recovers fairly quickly, but evidence shows that some of the markets that agriculture in Northern Ireland desperately needs may not return very quickly because of the strong pound. Despite the raging euro debate that sometimes occurs in the House, many people in agriculture think that joining the euro would provide stability, but that will not happen in the next few months. I hope that the Government will be sensitive to the need to ensure that agriculture does not collapse in Northern Ireland and that we do not have mass bankruptcies. Once bankruptcies begin, they will happen quickly. Many farmers live on the strength of the capital of their farms.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I asked the Minister to make clear the saving from student loans. Like all Liberal Democrats, I am sceptical about the student loans policy, and I want to ensure that the cut in funding for loans does not reflect a falling-off of student numbers.

I agree with the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. M. Smyth) about money for the Thanksgiving square project, which I understand is about £1 million, and I thank him and his colleagues for having advised me on the likely cost of the project. It is worth remembering that, as he said, Northern Ireland is a rather more eclectic religious community than the media sometimes suggest. I have had some dealings with the Baha'is in Northern Ireland, who are a tremendously humanist and positive force and are growing in numbers. Such religious communities have a lot to give through projects such as Thanksgiving square, which have relatively small costs in relation to the total appropriation.

Even though the Assembly has been suspended, we must continue to invest strategically in the infrastructure of Northern Ireland in the expectation that, once the current difficulties are resolved, Northern Ireland is likely to experience a fast and sustained economic expansion as a result of the various benefits available to investors in the

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>17</span>
province. It would be dangerous to stall now while waiting for a resolution of the current problems, and find that we are unable to meet the infrastructure demands of extra economic activity for transport and other important services such as sewerage, to which the hon. Member for Belfast, South alluded. I want to ensure that the Government are mindful of the need to look five years ahead in considering infrastructure and investment, rather than getting too caught up on current needs now, when economic development has not taken off, as one might have predicted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The money being invested in transport is welcome. Northern Ireland has the capacity to produce a model integrated transport system. For all its faults, transport in Northern Ireland remains more integrated in its format and operation than that in other parts of the United Kingdom, and I hope that the Government will be willing to use Northern Ireland as a fairly inexpensive experiment to discover what measures work and whether we can drive down car usage by making public transport so attractive that it is less bother to use it and leave the car at home.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My next point gives me great satisfaction. I always mention the Armagh observatory in these Committees, and I am pleased that it is under no immediate threat of cuts. I shall soon be visiting it on other business and shall share the good news, which I am sure will lead to massive gratitude to the Government from the professional astronomers whom I have praised so much in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is worth remembering that the size of the appropriation for Northern Ireland means that the Northern Ireland citizen receives the highest per head contribution from public funds of any citizen in the United Kingdom—for good and important reasons. The Government are right to maintain that high level of investment. We should remember that when the Assembly resumes its full powers that will not be a green light to reduce the appropriation. That must be done carefully, keeping in mind the economic development of a region that has suffered economic depression on account of the exceptional circumstances that it has faced, I counsel caution that when discussion resumes in Belfast that should not be a green light to reduce per head appropriation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We all hope that, when the Assembly restarts its work soon, there will be continuing dialogue on appropriation matters. Devolution does not mean that we can ignore the needs of Northern Ireland as it returns to normality. That dialogue means paying special attention to the economic and social requirements that the Assembly will not be able to meet as expected unless it is assured of the long-term stability of Government funding. That must continue until Northern Ireland is on its feet and able to be a world-class competitor in the industrial economy in which it is so well placed to participate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity that the Committee gives us to debate the estimates for the coming year and additional estimates for the existing financial year. It is clear that the additional sum needed is difficult to relate to the
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>18</span>
original estimate. I suggest that a column be added to page 4 of the document telling us the existing estimate before the addition of the supplementary figure. Also, it would be helpful if the present provisions and new provisions were totalled, as that would make it a lot easier for Members of Parliament to understand the figures.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It seems that an additional estimate of £4.4 million is required for the Northern Ireland Assembly in the current financial year. Slightly less will be required because of the suspension of the Assembly, but the figure is still considerably different from the original estimate. That becomes worse when we consider that Assembly expenditure for the coming year is estimated at £37,800,000. Last year, the Assembly cost £18,680,000, so there seems to be an increase of about 100 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An additional £23,300,000 is allocated for the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. Some of the duties that it performs may have been included in figures in the past, but it would be interesting to know which ones were included, and what the estimates were for this financial year so that we could judge such expenditure.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister hypes the Assembly up as usual, telling us how wonderful it is and how he regrets so much that it is suspended. I do not share his sentiments, and am glad that it is suspended. I hope that the Government will soon realise that the possibility of the Assembly returning in the form in which it ended is remote. From listening to speeches made by the Republic of Ireland's Prime Minister and Ministers from the southern Parliament, and the views of the Social Democratic and Labour party, we know that the chances of it coming back in its present form are extremely slim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of course, such an experiment is far too expensive. The Assembly has 108 Members representing a population of 1.5 million. The Welsh Assembly has only 60 Members, representing almost 3 million people. The Scottish Parliament has 129 Members, representing a population of just over 5 million. Why on earth does the Northern Ireland Assembly need 108 Members?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asked why such a disproportionate number of Assembly Members is necessary.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly has 108 Members as a result of gerrymandering designed to ensure that small, unrepresentative parties would get seats. For many years, the Unionists were accused of gerrymandering. However, that was minor compared with the gerrymandering that the Government undertakes when they want to achieve a certain result. We must

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>19</span>
re-examine the position and regain a proper democratic British assembly in Northern Ireland. Let us cease experimenting with new ideas that simply do not work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to Northern Irish agriculture, which is in a serious condition. Over the past five years, £756 million has been lost from the Province's economy as a result of agricultural crises. The total annual farm income has plummeted by 79 per cent. in real terms to £71 million in the same period. Without doubt, Northern Irish farming is in a disastrous position, made worse by the fact that farming is much more important in Northern Ireland's gross national product than it is in other parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem is especially acute in the pig industry. We once had 2,200 pig farmers, but the Ulster Farmers Union says that now only 900 are left. Pig factories are closing as a result, making it harder for farmers to get their pigs to processors. I know pig farmers who are deep in debt and deeply depressed. There has been a slight increase in price, but that is not nearly enough to meet producer costs and repay money that farmers have borrowed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Without a regime, it is difficult for the Government to give aid to the pig industry. Of course, we accept that the Government are under great pressure to use their powers to deploy European agrimonetary compensation. As there is no regime at present, will the Minister say whether such compensation could be given to the pig industry? If compensation is given, must it always be approved by Europe? Does it have to be met on a one-to-one basis by the Department of Agriculture or the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We also have problems with the fish industry. Fishermen are in difficulties because of the cod restrictions, particularly in the area where it has been designated that no cod fishing can take place. There are difficulties between the scientists and the fishermen. The fishermen do not always accept the views of the scientists. Fishermen probably know where the fish are better than the scientists. There needs to be co-operation between the two so that they can agree where the fish are and where cuts are needed to maintain the stock. The Government should look into the possibility of compensation for those whose businesses will be threatened because of the reduction in fish quotas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn now to roads. I notice that the £10 million for capital development on roads does not seem to have been taken up. Perhaps the Minister could explain why that is. When we ask the roads people why they are not operating certain schemes we are told that there is no money, but if my reading of this document is correct, there seems to be a saving of £10 million. In his initial remarks, the Minister said that there would be an increase in the roads capital expenditure in the forthcoming year. Is that an increase on last year's expenditure or last year's outturn, or is it an increase on the estimate for this financial year?
<br><br><!-- lb -->

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I wish to make a few, I hope, succinct remarks on the general nature of the appropriation order. I wish to refer in particular to the money that has been allotted to the Assembly. The hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) has already pointed out that the cost of the Assembly has doubled. Various figures have been mentioned, ranging up to £60 million per annum. That is justified on the basis that the Assembly will do good work and has done good work to date. I am sure that the Minister would agree that to date the only effective work of the Assembly has been to vote for a substantial pay increase for Members of £10,000 and corresponding increases in constituency allowances, which may or may not be justified depending on how that money is put to work. The Assembly has done little to justify the vast amount of money that is being expended on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak on two related matters—the grant and subsidy for agriculture and fisheries and the money to support the activities of the Industrial Development Board. The hon. Member for West Tyrone mentioned the disastrous state of farming, which is the biggest industry in Northern Ireland. It is having to cope with the effects of bovine spongiform encephalopathy and the awful position in which the Government have put the pig industry. Although measures may be justifiable on humanitarian grounds, their effect on the cost of pig production has made the British pig industry unable to compete with imported pork products from Europe, which are not subject to such onerous production costs. What can the much-vaunted Northern Ireland Assembly do to alleviate the plight of pig, beef and sheep farmers in Northern Ireland, all of whom are on the point of collapse? The answer is that it can do little or nothing. The factors that cause those problems are outside its control. It is powerless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for the IDB and the money to encourage industry, what can the Assembly do about the disastrous collapse of Northern Ireland's textile trade? In my constituency and the neighbouring constituency of the right hon. Member for Strangford, two major textile factories have had to close. Although they have been supplying Marks & Spencer for more than 20 years, it can no longer afford to purchase their products. They cannot compete with
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0575">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>21</span>
goods that are manufactured in Sri Lanka and elsewhere, which may be a result of the global economy. Not only can the Northern Ireland Assembly do little about that, but the United Kingdom Government are equally powerless.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In terms of appropriation, what does the Minister suggest should be done to alleviate the plight of farmers, textile workers and, in the light of the Minister's justifiable excuse for leaving today, Harland and Wolff. Harland and Wolff is Northern Ireland's biggest single employer in the heavy industry sector. It has issued 1,500 potential redundancy notices to its entire work force because no orders are on the books beyond July. Without orders, a great company, which built the Titanic, the Britannic, the Eagle and the Bulwark and which has been in business since 1860, is about to collapse. What can a Northern Ireland Assembly conceivably offer the 1,500 workers who will be made unemployed? The answer is nothing. Without intervention by central Government, who hold the purse strings and are responsible for the appropriations made here, the Northern Ireland Assembly can do nothing. However, its powerless presence—it was established only for political purposes, and, some would say, more to affect the mainland economy and the City of London than Northern Ireland—can eat up more than £60 million a year. That sum would go a long way towards alleviating the problems of unemployed people in farming and the textile and heavy industries. However, it will not do that, because the much-vaunted Assembly is really intended to provide transitional mechanisms to take Northern Ireland into a united Ireland, to appease the terrorists and prevent them from bombing the mainland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister will deal with the real problems of the people in Northern Ireland and not keep telling us that the wonderful Assembly, which has done nothing but vote itself massive pay increases, will contribute something instead of using funds that could be better spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

However, it is unfortunate that our elected colleagues on the other side of the little bit of water could not come to an arrangement that would allow the ferry that I am concerned about to continue. Although I know that it is not really the business of this Committee, I wonder if the Minister would tell us whether there have been any discussions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Minister could also tell us how things stand with the Belfast port. I know that discussions have taken place and that money from the sale of the port is to be used for roads. Can the Minister say whether a decision has been reached about the port?

My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast South raised a couple of points, one being planning—a favourite subject of this Committee over the years. The Government are in the process of deciding their policy on brownfield sites in our part of the United Kingdom, and on the number of houses that will be built and where they will be located. They are also considering whether houses should be built in greenfield areas. Have the Government made an estimate of the number of brownfield sites, and considered their location and whether they can be used for building homes? Do they pay attention to these aspects when they receive applications to build new housing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
By coincidence, a planning application has been made to build a village in part of my constituency at the same time as the Housing Executive is knocking down houses just down the road in Antrim town because they were not being used. There are many of these houses, which the Housing Executive has described as void houses. They were built in the past with great expectations but, unfortunately, for various reasons they are now being demolished. Why do the Government propose to build thousands of houses in an area that has been proposed as a greenfield site? What stage has this application reached, and has attention been paid to brownfield sites? I hope that the Minister will answer these questions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The application may go to a public inquiry, because the planners have a habit of allowing applications to go to inquiry although, as far as I can judge, most of the time the planning service does not fight them. The planning service takes almost a neutral position. It simply lays out facts and figures for the inquiry and allows it to continue along those lines. If planning is not to be granted, the planning service should fight the case and state the reasons for refusing planning permission.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

My hon. Friends and others may experience problems when they travel through the Templepatrick area to Belfast international airport because there is an unmanned crossing on the line.

A peculiar situation developed in my constituency involving what the building trade refers to as a blackmail strip. If an estate is built and access is needed to, for example, a road, it may be necessary to cross a small strip of land that belongs to someone else, which the builder will have to buy. If the owner of that strip of land does not wish to sell it or to do so at a reasonable price, it is referred to as a blackmail strip because the owner blackmails the developer or builder into handing over a lot of money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a blackmail strip in my constituency that belongs to the Department of the Environment through the Valuation and Lands Agency. The agency repeatedly increased the price to the developer of the blackmail strip. The site has been there for years; nobody knows why, but it was left for some purpose. The agency would not sell to the developer at a reasonable cost the part of the site—the blackmail strip—that provides the safest and most convenient access to the road, and the DoE planning service would not allow it, due to the number of houses. The matter was eventually settled, but it cost a considerable amount of money. It is unbelievable that a public body should take that approach.

My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South rightly mentioned the Christmas bonus. I should like to make a couple of points about that. There appears
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>24</span>
to be a great puzzle as to who paid it. Apparently, those who were receiving a retirement pension received it one way and those who were receiving income support or disability living allowance. Consequently, it was difficult to trace the reason why a person who should have received it had not done so. I heard about the case of a gentleman who was living in a residential home on the date on which it was to be paid, and because of that, the bonus was paid to the residential home. He did not get it—at the time of year when he needed it—because on the next day, he moved out of the residential home and into his own dwelling.

My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South referred to the Water Service. I too find it puzzling that the whole system was not gradually updated over the years, but was left until it required a lot of money to carry out that work. Burst pipes cause great problems to the Water Service. I once asked someone involved in the service what percentage of leaks he would find acceptable. After great consideration, he said that it was between 5 and 10 per cent. As someone who was in that business, I know that anyone doing a plumbing job for a householder would not be satisfied to leave a 5 to 10 per cent. leak in the house. It puzzles me that the Water Service is content to leave a certain percentage of water leaking when the object of the exercise is to stop water leaking.

It has to be spread on fields on the mountain? Where does it go? If it is being spread out to dry again, to get rid of it under the soil, when it rains it will be taken into the soil and into the rivers. If it goes into the rivers it will be used again.

On votes 1 and 2, my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone referred to the crisis facing the agriculture industry in Northern Ireland. No one could underestimate the impact that that has had on families dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods. I have met some of those families in my constituency; it is heartrending to listen to the stories of their recent experiences and the hardships that have befallen them. At times we are tempted to talk about profits, grants and intervention but at the end of the day this is about people—people who have, over many years, invested much in the agricultural industry. The Minister may know that the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is due to publish the report of its inquiry into the livestock industry in Northern Ireland. I hope that he will take account of its recommendations, and that the financial support that the agricultural industry in Northern Ireland needs can be found. It is crucial that we support an industry that is still the largest provider of employment in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In vote 3, allocations are made to the Industrial Development Board. I commend the IDB for its efforts in trying to attract inward investment to Northern Ireland. I also commend the Minister for his efforts in promoting Northern Ireland as a place for investment. I also thank him for his co-operation in having the Knockmore industrial site in my constituency opened and properly laid out and getting services installed. He will know that we have not yet been able to attract an investor to the site. I urge him and the IDB, in co-operation with myself, the local Lisburn borough council and the Lisburn enterprise organisation, to redouble efforts to attract potential investors to the site at Knockmore. That part of Lisburn is zoned under the regional strategic plan to be a significant growth area in the Belfast metropolitan region. If we are to expand such areas, bring in thousands of people and build homes for them, we need to have the jobs in that area. Knockmore's strategic location is therefore crucial to reaching that
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>26</span>
objective. I hope that we can make progress in attracting some investment to Knockmore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also wish to mention the situation at Harland and Wolff. Having been involved in some of the background work, I thank the Minister, his Department and the IDB for their efforts to assist Harland and Wolffwin the contract for the so-called Queen Mary liner, for which they are presently tendering, in competition with a French shipyard. At the moment, negotiations are continuing between his Department, the Department for Trade and Industry and the Treasury about the financial support that can be given to the company to help it win that vital contract. I cannot underestimate the importance of Harland and Wolff to the city of Belfast and to the economy of Northern Ireland. It is of financial and symbolic importance. Flying into Belfast, one is always struck by the prominence of the two cranes at the shipyard. That says something about the industrial contribution that Belfast has made to the nation. I hope that that company, with its long, proud history of providing employment in Belfast and the wider community, can be sustained. We should not underestimate the seriousness of its current position.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the company is important not only to the economy of Northern Ireland, but to the economy of the UK as a whole, and especially to the steel industry?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for that valid point. When I and other colleagues met the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry last week, we impressed on him the benefits for many companies in Great Britain of attracting the Queen Mary project to Harland and Wolff. The company hopes that the entire project could be completed in the United Kingdom, and that many aspects of the project could be carried out by companies in Scotland, England and Wales. We should regard it as a British project rather than merely a Northern Ireland project. I recognise the limitations that the seventh directive on shipbuilding places on the Minister in respect of Government assistance for such projects, but I hope that the Government will do all that they can to support Harland and Wolff in securing that vital order from Carnival to build the liner.

Vote 5 makes allocations to the Training and Employment Agency. My party welcomes the new deal programme in Northern Ireland, and we have tried to cooperate in its implementation at constituency level. My experience in Lagan Valley is that the part of the programme that helps young people to secure placements with local businesses works fairly well, although take-up rates could be better. However, I am worried about the part of the programme that is designed to help young people undertake vocational training and re-enter further and higher education. Some confusion seems to have arisen over how the scheme works in practice, and the liaison between the TEA and local further education institutions seems to have been inadequate. I urge the Minister to review the implementation of the programme and to examine how co-operation between the TEA and local further education institutions can be enhanced.

Vote 7 relates to transport. I concur with the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim. We welcome the reopening of the Bleach green line, which will improve the journey time between Londonderry and Belfast. However, it will have consequences. The estimate is for an allocation of £588,000 for rural transport. The existing line, which runs from Antrim through Crumlin, Glenavy and Ballinderry to Lisburn is in danger of being mothballed, which would be a serious blow to the provision of rural transport in the area. I hope that the Minister, together with Translink, will enable that stretch of railway line to remain open, and that the investment necessary to maintain the line will be provided. Rural communities in Crumlin, Glenavy and Ballinderry depend on that line. If we want to promote rural transport and encourage people to leave the motor car at home, it would be a retrograde step to close that stretch of railway line. I hope that that will not happen as a consequence of reopening the Bleach green line between Antrim and Belfast.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vote 4 provides for an internal reallocation of £200,000 of the Chancellor's initiative allocation, and for a reduction of £1,300,000 due to the delay in the sale of Belfast port, to which other hon. Members have already referred. The proceeds from the sale of Belfast port were due to be allocated at least in part to major roads programmes in Northern Ireland. Will the delay in that sale affect those schemes, especially the scheme in my constituency involving the Al dual carriageway, the main Belfast to Dublin road? The scheme would improve junctions with the Hillsborough road in Dromore and the Rathfriland road in Banbridge, which is in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble). Both junctions have a high accident rate and have experienced several fatalities in recent years. I welcome the proposals to improve the junctions and provide new slip roads, and I hope that the schemes will not be delayed as a result of the delay in the sale of Belfast port.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vote 12 deals with education and library boards. As we celebrate 150 years of public libraries in the United Kingdom this year—and as this is the national year of reading—I welcome the addition of £3,628,000 for school books, including the 1999 budget allocation of £2,628,000 and the £300,000 for public library books.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is one thing to provide the books, but another to have good libraries. I want to mention Lisburn library. As the Minister will know, Lisburn is the second largest local government area in Northern Ireland, and one of the fastest growing towns in the Province. However, the public library building in Lisburn is totally inadequate. It was a temporary provision a number of years ago. I understand that Lisburn library has now been displaced on the waiting list for new libraries by Strabane. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the matter. I do not seek to have Strabane displaced, but I hope a new public library in Lisburn can be provided soon. In such a large town, which has now applied for city status, it cannot be right that we do not have an adequate public library building. The
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>28</span>
staff in that library are among the most helpful and efficient people in public service. I know that they would welcome a better environment in which to work and provide and improve the service to the local community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to discuss pre-school education under the education and library board allocations. The Government have made pre-school education a priority, which I welcome. I also welcome the efforts being made by the Department of Education, in cooperation with education and library boards, to extend that provision throughout Northern Ireland. Fairness is an issue in the allocation of pre-school education provision. I shall provide an example that affects my constituency, in the village of Dunmurry and the ward of Seamore Hill. Seamore Hill and Dunmurry are set on the edge of Belfast, between Belfast and Lisburn. Dunmurry is adjacent to the large housing developments of Twinbrook and Poleglass.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The allocation to the maintained sector and to the controlled or state sector is a significant issue. In Twinbrook, St. Mark's nursery unit has 52 places, St. Luke's nursery school has 52 places, and there is a proposal for a 26-place nursery unit at the Irish Language School in Twinbrook. In Poleglass, the Good Shepherd nursery school has 52 places, St. Kieran's nursery school has 52 places and St. Therese nursery school has 52 places. All those schools are in the maintained sector. Also in the Dunmurry area, the Our Lady Queen of Peace nursery school has 52 places, Christ the Redeemer nursery unit at Lagmore has 52 proposed places, while there is a proposal for a new nursery unit at Oakwood integrated primary school. There is absolutely no provision in Dunmurry's controlled state sector. A proposal currently exists for a 52-place nursery unit at Dunmurry primary school, and there is some dispute over whether there should be provision at Seamore Hill primary school. As a result, the decision is being delayed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A 52-place unit should be introduced at Dunmurry primary school, and at least a 26-place unit at Seamore Hill primary school. If that is not possible, as a compromise there should be a 26-place unit at Dunmurry primary school and another at Seamore Hill primary school.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Office will argue that that is unacceptable in an urban area, unless a special case can be made. Well, I believe that a special case can be made. If a special case can be made for an Irish language school to have a 26-place unit in an urban area, a similar case can be made for an urban area with high social needs such as Seamore Hill. It should have a 26-place unit alongside the proposed unit at Dunmurry primary school. I urge the Minister to resolve the outstanding issues and move forward so that the state schools—the controlled sector—in the Dunmurry area can have adequate pre-school education provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a problem not only in Lisburn, but throughout Northern Ireland.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, which endorsed the concern of many people about the disparity in the provision of preschool education between the maintained and the controlled sector. I hope that the problems in the Dunmurry area can be quickly resolved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I should like to deal with vote 14 on health and personal social services. I echo the concerns raised about allocations to the Eastern Health and Social Services Board by its chairman, Mr. Dan Thompson. It has not been given the allocation that it requires to maintain the level of services throughout the board's area, which has had a strong impact on community care services. In my constituency there is now a 12-month delay in obtaining occupational therapy assessment. That has consequences across the whole spectrum of health care provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Elderly people in the Lagan Valley hospital want to return to their families, but are unable to do so because decisions cannot be taken on community care services. Beds are occupied, which can cause serious problems of availability during epidemics such as this winter's flu. Elderly people also have to wait up to a year for occupational therapy assessments of the heating systems in their homes. I ask the Minister to reflect further on the allocations to the Eastern Health and Social Services Board and to address these serious problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to ask the Minister about the recent sale of Kilwarlin house in Hillsborough, which I understand netted around £4 million. What should happen to that money? I believe that it should be spent in the local community on capital projects that are urgently needed in the Lisburn area rather than be drawn back in central health service funds. I ask the Minister to be generous in his consideration of this matter. The Lagan Valley hospital needs capital expenditure for its plans to upgrade existing service provision; and there is an urgent need for a new children's home in the Lisburn area. A site in the north of Lisburn has been proposed but the capital is not yet available. I hope that the Minister will be generous and sympathetic to the Down Lisburn trust when he considers the allocation of the proceeds of the sale of Kilwarlin house in Hillsborough.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This has been a good debate. I stopped counting after the thirty-second issue had been raised. You, Mr. McWilliam, and members of the Committee will appreciate that it will be impossible for me to deal with every one of them in detail, although I shall try. Careful note has been made of all the points. Those to which I am unable to
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>30</span>
respond will be answered in writing to each hon. Member.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) was heading in the direction of being constructive when he began his speech, but given your strictures, Mr. McWilliam, I shall not get involved in that issue at this point in the debate, except to say that, whatever position each member of the Committee takes, all of us would like there to be stable government by locally elected politicians. Most of us want the Good Friday agreement to be implemented in full.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked me to be sympathetic and generous on one issue. I assure him that I shall be sympathetic, but I can give no such guarantee that I shall be generous. The resources that are available to us do not always allow us to follow through the consequences of our sympathy by being generous.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that pre-school provision in Dunmurry is a problem. I have recently become a Minister with responsibility for education for the first time. I promise the hon. Gentleman that I will consider it because I know that it is an issue that is of great concern. The hon. Gentleman will understand, however, that it would be wrong of me to make promises that he wants me to make a debate such as this. Similarly with Lisburn library, he knows that I am a frequent visitor to that fine town, which aspires to be a city. I take a keen interest in its development, although it is perhaps not quite as keen as his. I hear what he says. We all agree about the importance of developing a proper library service there. I shall take a keen interest in the way in which the library progresses.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the allocation to the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, I too read the comments of Mr. Thompson, its chairman, whom I know well, but I am not convinced that they were entirely accurate or that they were a fair reflection of the allocation that we made. I have written to Mr. Thompson, pointing out that there were some perhaps unintended misrepresentations in his press release. For the purposes of this debate, I am not anxious to get into a public dispute with someone who is not here to defend himself. I say only that I am aware of the criticisms, and that health is an issue for which we could provide endless additional resources but still there would never be enough. However, we take this matter seriously and during the period, which I hope will be short, when I am again the Minister with responsibility for health matters, I shall take seriously representations that are made to me, provided that they are based on fact not conjecture, and are not purely an emotional response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Under-Secretary say that the chairman of the board was making a conjecture when he referred to the pressures that would result from lack of nursing provision in private and residential homes?

	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>31</span>
health, and as a Member of Parliament representing an English constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the hon. Gentleman conceded, having health and social services under a single budget and source of direction provides advantages that do not pertain in England. However, there will always be cries that more resources are needed to deal with winter pressures. When I had ministerial responsibility for health last summer—before devolution—we asked the four health boards what they needed to stave off the worst consequences of winter pressures. As I recall, we were asked for a total of £7.6 million, which I found and gave them. I was then perturbed—although I no longer had ministerial responsibility for health—to discover that winter pressures and crises have arisen even though those boards have received the money that they asked for.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am in the process of finding out exactly how that money is being spent. The hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley should be aware that I am in correspondence with Mr. Thompson about his remarks, given the history of the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Lagan Valley mentioned problems co-ordinating the new deal. I shall not go into too much detail, as my right hon. Friend the Minister of State was present for that part of the debate and helpfully told me that, as he had responsibility for such matters, he would meet with the hon. Gentleman, if there were such a problem. I am sure that arrangements can be made for such a discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) and other hon. Members raised the vexatious issue of agriculture and the incomes of those in the farming industry, especially farmers in certain sectors. The Government recognise that agriculture throughout the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland—where, in some ways, the position is different—is experiencing an extremely difficult period.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Agriculture has received several cash injections in the past six months, including schemes to benefit different parts of the industry. As my right hon. Friend said, a total of £16.8 million in agrimonetary assistance was given to Northern Ireland in 1999, and £8.5 million has been earmarked for the next two years. The Government are committed to giving substantial additional funds to rural development—the second pillar of the common agricultural policy—especially in relation to the rural development regulation plans for Northern Ireland that were recently submitted to the European Union.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs, the Under-Secretary will be aware of a scheme that was introduced in the Republic, whereby pig producers are receiving compensation for marketing costs, following the fire that destroyed pig production factories at Ballymoney or Ballymena—I forget which.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. The Republic of Ireland has a scheme that is specific to the pig industry, but my information is that such a scheme would not cover a large number of pig farmers in Northern Ireland and would not produce the level of resources that have been claimed for it. However, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, who is no longer present for reasons that the Committee understands, has been in dialogue with the pig farmers over the last few days and will remain in dialogue. Those issues can be covered and the statistics can be studied. For obvious reasons I do not want to be drawn into a debate about the statistics. Suffice it to say that I do not believe that the benefits that are claimed for that scheme would necessarily be as great as people think they might be for Northern Ireland. But my right hon. Friend continues to look into that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will, but briefly. The hon. Gentleman will understand that I have only 15 minutes left to cover 27 points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the fact that the Irish Republic could get £1 million show that when they negotiate with Europe, they seem to do a lot better than we do in the United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to get drawn into that debate. My point is that the scheme in question probably would not have the benefits that are claimed for it. It would not be helpful for me to enter into a debate about the relative merits of the Republic of Ireland's approach to the European Union and our own, in the context either of the point that the hon. Gentleman was trying to make, or wider relationships. I shall not give way any more in the brief time that I have left. Hon. Members will know that it is not my normal practice to refuse to give way but frankly there is so much to cover that I do not want to neglect any points.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam.

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is from 2.30 to 5.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sorry, Mr. McWilliam. I inadvertently misled the Committee. Clearly I will have to give way a little more.

On the issue of agriculture, the Committee will know that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has convened a summit of industry leaders on 30 March. The aim of the summit is to work out a longer term strategy for the whole of the UK industry. Of course, as is right and proper, legitimate Northern Ireland interests will be represented at that summit. I hope that some of the points that have been raised today can be discussed there to see where they fit into that wider strategy that clearly is necessary for the future of agriculture in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A few specific points about agriculture still need to be covered and I shall do so as best I can. The hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. Robert McCartney), as is his custom, came in, orated and left without waiting to hear the response. I am familiar
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0581">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>33</span>
with his approach and it is not necessarily a criticism. I hold him in high regard, but it is perhaps not quite as high as the regard in which he holds himself. He asked in particular about the powers of the Assembly and UK Government with regard to agriculture. Both the UK Government and the devolved Administration operate a wide range of schemes in support of farming. However, whether it is a UK-wide scheme or a scheme promoted by the Assembly or Assembly Ministers, we operate under the common agriculture policy where it applies. In some areas, such as pig farming, there is a light CAP approach, but in other areas it is heavier. That leaves room for flexibility in some sectors, but not so much in others. The Assembly had various ambitions in this regard, and there is scope for it, and for us in the United Kingdom, to take action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. and learned Member for North Down said that the Assembly had no powers or locus in the matter, but that is not strictly true. That suggestion may have served his wider political argument, but it did not help our discussion on agriculture. In response to an intervention a moment ago, I spoke about compensation in the pig sector, and I shall not pursue that matter further.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Tyrone raised concerns about cod fishermen. I am sure that all Committee members have sympathy with fishermen who have had to forgo their traditional spring cod catch. Frankly, however, the cod have to be allowed to spawn during that period, but prawn fishing will continue to operate without serious restrictions, which will secure continuity of supply to the important processing industry in Kilkeel. The difficulty was brought about by the prevailing season and the need to replenish stocks, but fishermen often change their activities in view of scarcity of stock or the current state of market prices. My right hon. Friend the right hon. Friend the Minister of State is holding discussions with fishermen, and we share the concerns that have been expressed on the matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for West Tyrone and for South Antrim discussed tuberculosis and brucellosis. Research for antigens that could be used in a serological test is continuing, and the results should be available later this month. There is some evidence to suggest that the badger may play a more significant role in the spread of TB among cattle than has previously been supposed. Northern Ireland will take cognisance of the findings of the current experiment in Great Britain, which seeks to establish the effectiveness of different badger control strategies. We are waiting for that evidence, and we shall take appropriate action when we have it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Down discussed Northern Ireland's textile and clothing industry, and he rightly mentioned a couple of recent announcements that have caused concern. The long-term trend in employment in textiles and clothing in Northern Ireland continues to be downward, which is of concern, but that trend needs to be seen in context. There has been a significant fall in employment in the industry during the past few years because textile and clothing companies face stiff overseas competition, and because of difficulties caused by the continuing
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>34</span>
strength of sterling against other currencies. The recently announced job losses are regrettable because Northern Ireland has some strong and competitive companies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the current climate, the industry's future is highly dependent on its being able to make changes to differentiate products and target export growth. The IDB's strategy is to support the industry and encourage it to make business more competitive by giving those matters greater focus. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State and the IDB remain ready to continue to work with the industry to see where improvements can be made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem of the sale of Belfast harbour was raised by the hon. Member for South Antrim. There is no point pretending that it has gone as smoothly as we had hoped. As part of the Chancellor's economic initiative in May 1998, Northern Ireland was to be allowed to retain about £70 million of the proceeds to spend on the Province if the sale went ahead, but it had to be deferred this year. Therefore, expenditure will continue to be deferred until the receipts come in from the sale, which we hope will happen. The general principle for the such sale is that all proceeds go to the Treasury, so it is a major departure for Northern Ireland to retain the receipt. That decision is not a precedent for the issue that was raised by the hon. Member for Lagan Valley about premises in his constituency. At the moment, we hope that the outstanding difficulties surrounding the saie can be overcome. The schemes that have had to be deferred, including transport schemes, are detailed on page 29 of the estimates. I do not propose to talk about them at length, save to say that it is a matter of some regret that schemes have been materially affected by the loss of that £70 million. We hope that those schemes can be reinstated in some other way in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Tyrone talked about a reduction of £10 million, the details of which are on page 29.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand what the Under-Secretary said, but I do not understand the explanation of why the £10 million was not spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will try to explain again. The Treasury agreed that £70 million be allocated from the proceeds of the sale of Belfast harbour, but that sale was not completed and there are outstanding difficulties. Because it did not happen, £10 million of expenditure in the current year has had to be deferred. That means that several schemes, some of which were mentioned, will be materially affected. The hon. Member for West Tyrone looks confused; if I have confused matters even more, he should tell me so, but that is the situation as I understand it.

Translink has commissioned an economic appraisal of the Antrim-Knockmore rail link, so that it can properly evaluate its future. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on that assessment, but my right hon. Friend the Minister of State and I shall reflect on the points that have been raised when we receive it. The line is used by 780 passengers a week, so it is significant. That will be taken into account when further decisions are made.

The hon. Members for South Antrim and for Belfast, South referred to the Ballycastle-Campbeltown ferry service. Department officials have worked actively with the Scottish Office to explore the options for a joint package to support the continuance of that service, but, unfortunately, on 21 February, following a board meeting, the company decided for commercial reasons that it would not continue the service. My colleagues and I realise that that decision was disappointing, particularly for the Northern Ireland tourist board. We shall continue to work with all concerned to develop tourism in the north Antrim area because that is important and it is a place of great natural beauty. It is a two-way street—there are good commercial advantages for the local economy and it is a good place to visit so people should know about it and have access.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Antrim referred to public transport and public private partnerships. A review of those partnerships and the opportunities that they create for public transport services has recently been completed. The conclusions and recommendations of that review are being considered, and I hope that a decision on the way forward can be taken soon. It is important for those decisions to be made, but it is also important that they are right.

The issue of Harland and Wolff was raised, legitimately and responsibly. No one was trying to make political capital out of it and everyone realises that the matter is critical. It would be wrong for me to speculate on its future and the order that it has bid for, but I can assure the Committee that my right hon. Friends the Minister of State and the Secretary of State, who has taken a great interest in the matter, and I, and our officials will continue to provide whatever help and support we can within the available resources and regulations. To go further than that at this stage would be imprudent and I do not propose to do so. The fact that the Committee has raised its concern about the matter on several occasions adds to the voices saying that this is an important issue.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Hunter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Without seeking to make any political capital, I draw the Under-Secretary's attention to the fact that Shorts is also dependent on on-going contracts. There is a strong rumour in this place that the BVRAAM missile order may not go to Raytheon, Shorts, Thompson, Thorn; that would threaten job security. Let us also not forget the problems that Gallaher, the tobacco manufacturer, is facing because of smuggling and other factors.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman, in one short intervention, has added three new topics to my list. I am aware of the excellent work done at Shorts. I had an opportunity early in the new year to go on a visit. I am a former engineer—I admit that it was a long time ago, as it was in your case, Mr. McWilliam—but Shorts is so technologically advanced that I barely understand some of the processes that it carries out. It is a great centre of engineering excellence and a great credit to Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State had a presentation from the people from Raytheon—I think
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>36</span>
it was last week—so he, too, is aware of the issues. It would not be proper for me to make any detailed comment at this stage, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that, to use a football metaphor, our eye is well and truly on the ball. That is an issue which, under your generous chairmanship, Mr. McWilliam, we have been able to explore.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Antrim also asked about the position on renewable energy. Progress has been made in Northern Ireland and we are more than two thirds of the way towards meeting the existing target of 45 megawatts by 2005, mainly as a result of two non-fossil fuel obligation orders made in 1994 and 1996. I do not claim any credit for that, as they were made under a previous Administration, but the targets are being met.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smith</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's acknowledgment that the orders were made under a previous Government, but will he accept that, in the context of climate change and the whole concept of energy, Northern Ireland has proportionately higher pollution than other parts of the United Kingdom? Would it be possible to arrange with the Chancellor that we can go ahead with the extension of gas throughout Northern Ireland? That could help us to meet the climate change target more effectively.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Northern Ireland housing executive has taken a close interest in the environmental consequences of different fuels and is considering promoting gas as a priority over other fuels. We are alive to the issue and, as the responsible Minister—though not, I hope, for too long—I shall continue to take a close interest in it.

As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire will be aware, a draft regional strategic framework for Northern Ireland was published for public comment in December, and an independent panel conducted a public examination of major matters of concern in October and November 1999. In January the panel's report was submitted to the then Minister of Regional Development, the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson). He published the paper in February and invited comments by May 2000. He also asked officials to prepare a final version of the strategy in time for the Assembly to have it before the summer recess. Either it will go to him and then to the Assembly, or it will come to a Northern Ireland Office Minister. In either event, it is a serious issue to which we should give careful thought. We acknowledge the strategic importance of some of the decisions to be taken, but it would be inappropriate to go into more detail.

The hon. Member for West Tyrone, who has temporarily left the Room, made a technical point about some parts of the estimates. It is interesting to consider whether a change in format on the lines he suggested would be possible if we moved to resource-based budgeting. However, as with most matters of accountancy, I do not know the answer to the question. There are several accounting conventions that apply to the publication of public estimates and accounts, but I am happy for officials to consider the hon. Gentleman's points.
<br><br><!-- lb -->

The hon. Member for West Tyrone and the hon. and learned Member for North Down mentioned the cost of the Assembly, which the commission considered. The requirements were for a full year and that is the way the figure was calculated. I am not in a position to defend or attack the commission's work which I am sure was carried out diligently and in good faith; it would be inappropriate for me to undermine it. It calculated the costs that it thought appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The size of the Assembly's membership, which the hon. and learned Member for North Down and the hon. Member for West Tyrone mentioned, was agreed by the parties to the Good Friday agreement. It would be wrong of me to say that there are too many or too few Members, or to comment on how much they are paid. The commission was given the power to take that decision, and took it. I hope that I am not misrepresenting him when I say that the hon. Member for North Down voted against the motion in question, as did members of Sinn Fein and one or two other parties. Members of this House know that Members who vote themselves a pay increase get a fair amount of stick from their constituents for doing so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hull, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Never!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Well, except for my hon. Friend, apparently. Prior to the general election, when the subject had a high profile, one or two of my constituents told me that they were not too happy about it. However, democratic bodies have the right to set their own remuneration, and I sure that Members of the Assembly are willing and able to account for themselves to the electorate. I cannot go further into the continuation of the Assembly's costs; the lower rate of pay will not last long if, as we hope, it is quickly up and running again.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In 30 years in the House, I have received only half a dozen letters from constituents about an increase in Members' wages. However, I have recently received letters comparing the increase in the wages of Members of Parliament with the paltry amount that is given each week to old-age pensioners, which I am looking forward to rectifying.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That matter is not in order in this debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is being a little adventurous on this occasion. I have received more letters about the remuneration of Members of Parliament than my hon. Friend, which proves that his constituents are happier with him than mine are with me. [	<i>Interruption.</i>] My hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dowd) says, rather unfairly, "That is not difficult".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for Belfast, South and for South Antrim mentioned planning policy, both generally and in terms of its administration. They cited some specific cases, but I am sure that they will forgive me if I am not drawn into the specifics of those cases. However, I am currently responsible for such matters, so if either of the hon. Gentleman's care to write to me about them, I shall be happy to consider them. I know that some difficult planning cases are outstanding; I shall
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>38</span>
not mention them by name, but some of them are currently on my desk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is regrettable, but true, that important planning decisions are often taken to judicial review. Frankly, in calculating the estimates and the cost of the planning system, it would be imprudent not to expect a certain amount of judicial review of major decisions. For obvious reasons, I shall not be drawn into commenting on the decisions that are either on my desk or about to land on it. Although it is unfortunate, we must take account of such costs. On the difficulties in communication between those affected by planning proposals and the planning system, I would be happy to consider simplifying the system if that could be done over a long period, but given the complications that currently exist, I hold out no promise that I could do so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention has been made of the clawback that the Department expects to receive from the Northern Ireland Electricity's disposal of its Danesfort premises and the Shop Electric retail chain. The Valuation and Lands Agency, which is advising the Department on its clawback entitlement, has advised that, on the basis of its initial assessment, its most optimistic estimate is that up to £6 million in clawback could be realised as a result of those disposals. That is the best advice that I have received, but if anything can be added I shall contact members of the Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the question of unmanned level crossings at Templepatrick, work is being done by Translink, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I take a particular interest in safety issues, so we shall investigate the matter and write to the hon. Member for South Antrim. On the question of blackmail strips, if the hon. Gentleman would write to me explaining the details, I shall ensure that that matter is taken up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South referred to occupational therapy services. The Department and the Northern Ireland health executive are undertaking a joint review of housing adaptation services. I hope that the review will identify the key issues and consider what is impeding the delivery of such adaptations and how to improve the service. I do not have a plan at hand, but I know from the telephone calls and correspondence that I receive that it is a real problem, and I am committed to solving it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When the Under-Secretary and his colleagues consider those services, will they compare South and East Belfast HSS trust and North and West Belfast HSS trust? The south and east trust has been able to do more than the north and west trust, in which there was a moratorium, yet it had a higher percentage of applicants. The north and west trust should receive the same amount of money as the south and east trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention and I shall ensure that work is done to make that comparison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also referred to residential child care services and the recent case involving child prostitution. As he rightly said, because the matter is being investigated by the police, it would be wrong to say too much about it in the Committee. However, on
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1999-2000V010P0I0584">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>39</span>
the general issue of child care, we accept that there are problems in the service. Part of our concern is statistical: there has been a fall in supply since 1986. The report, "Children Matter", tried to address the matter and a project team is considering how to make progress.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to child abuse. One of the great public policy failures of the post-war period in this country has been the failure to look after children who are in need of supervision, whether residential or otherwise, and to protect them from the evil forces that found their way to where such children were. I am not criticising a specific Government, local government or part of the country, but there has been a failure of public policy on a wide and general scale, as recent events in Wales have revealed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
While I have had responsibility for the matter, I have taken it very seriously and, earlier this week, I started a process of review. I do not intend to invite applications, consultations, papers and so on; instead, I intend to implement a short, sharp review—it will probably take no more than half a day—with officials from the two Departments involved to see what is happening and how we can improve practices to ensure that supervision is adequate. That is my aim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also a problem with numbers and with the quality and amount of protection that is built into the system. I am determined to get to the bottom of the matter and to improve it where necessary. When we take on responsibility for looking after children, whether as parents or as people responsible for public policy, we have a huge obligation that we must discharge to the best of our ability and as professionally and effectively as possible. I have made that undertaking and it is one to which all members of the Committee could happily sign up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South also referred to the water industry. The Government are conscious of the substantial resource requirements arising from increasingly stringent drinking and waste water quality standards. For the reasons given by the hon. Gentleman, it is important that those standards are high and remain high. The significant additional funding of £85 million that was announced following the comprehensive spending review will enhance the Water Service's capital investment programme. There is a need for further investment in sewerage systems and water supply pipelines, and we continue to monitor that through the comprehensive spending review and normal funding, but the hon. Gentleman made a good point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentlemen also referred to leakage. The Water Service aims to invest £80 million over the next three years in reducing losses from the distribution system. Again, one could argue for more resources but that amount constitutes a significant investment that will result in the retention of more water and will prevent some of the problems caused by water escaping into other systems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of lead in drinking water. The service has carried out a risk
	<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>40</span>
assessment to identify areas in Northern Ireland where non-compliance with EC standards has occurred or may occur. It is currently implementing a prioritised action plan to rectify the situation as soon as possible. We know where the problems are and resources are being applied, I hope urgently, to solving them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Has the Department considered how it can help those who managed to purchase their homes from the Housing Executive and who are therefore no longer entitled to have necessary work carried out by the Housing Executive? Most of them are on pensions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: All sorts of maintenance problems arise for people who purchase such properties and I cannot make a commitment on that issue without it creating consequences for a range of others. I shall reflect on the matter and take further advice. The hon. Gentleman will know, as we probably all know from our surgeries, that people who enter into owner-occupation regularly have difficulties and find that maintenance is an economic load that they cannot handle in their older years. That is not an argument against owner-occupation; it simply means that problems can emerge in properties of a certain age or condition.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to aluminium in drinking waters. Again, the Water Service's capital works programme aims to rectify areas where water does not conform to the regulations; that includes the presence of aluminium. Since 1990, the Water Service has spent approximately £120 million on the provision of new and upgraded water treatment works and plans to spend a further £120 million from 2010. Again, considerable investment has taken place and will take place in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised some technical issues about the operation of winter fuel payments, particularly in relation to procedures. I shall write to him on some of the details that he raised but I assure him that when we have fully considered the implications of the judgment in respect of 60-year-old men, we will meet the financial commitments—whatever the implications turn out to be. So while I cannot promise that all the anomalies and difficulties will be ironed out immediately, once we have considered the judgment—which takes time—we will take the requirements placed on us very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I think that I have covered most of the points raised. I shall go over the record carefully to check that I have not overlooked anything.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend should ask for extra time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If my hon. Friend wants extra time, he can ask for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been a useful debate. Important issues have been raised in the entirely constructive spirit that I have come to expect from members of the Committee. Where it is necessary to reflect further, we will do so and where it is necessary to cover ground that I have omitted to cover, we will do so. I thank the Committee for its forbearance.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
