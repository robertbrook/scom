	<div class='debates'>
	<section>
	<div class='legislation'>Life Sentences (Northern Ireland)</div> <!-- legislation -->
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I remind hon. Members that the debate may continue until 11.15 am. I have no power to put a time limit on speeches, but brief contributions will enable me to call as many hon. Members as possible. I also remind hon. Members that debate is limited to the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>9.15 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the proposal for a draft Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order.</p></blockquote>
I will take on board what you said about being brief, Mr. McWilliam, but it is an important order and worthy of a full explanation. I hope that my explanation will help the Committee to understand it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is indeed an important piece of legislation, but are we not wasting our time today if no changes can be made? Is that correct?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I had hoped to explain the process by which we want to conduct this morning's business. If I had been allowed to do so before the hon. Gentleman intervened, I would have explained that we are meeting today because the Chairman of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs, of which the hon. Gentleman is a member, wrote to my Department requesting that the order be considered by the Northern Ireland Grand Committee. It is in compliance with that request that we meet today. The hon. Gentleman is right that the order cannot be amended, but the Assembly has commented on the order, my Department has received 18 representations from individuals and organisations, and any views expressed by the Committee will be taken on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is not the final order, but a draft. We want to hear the Committee's views on the order because it establishes new principles in legislation applying to Northern Ireland. It is right that we should consult widely and that we should respond to points of substance that will assist in the final form of the order. I do not accept the hon. Gentleman's criticism. I repeat that we are dealing with the order today at the request of the Chairman of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. It would have been inappropriate to have ignored that request.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another aspect is the timing of the debate. We could have left our consideration until the Grand Committee's next quarterly meeting in June. However,
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
if another equally or more pressing matter needed to be dealt with, the order would not have been considered until the Committee's next quarterly meeting unless an emergency meeting was called. That would have delayed the final production of the order and its consideration by the various Committees of the House. We want to put this important piece of legislation on the statute book for reasons that I shall set out in my explanation. I am grateful to the Grand Committee for convening this sitting and allowing hon. Members the opportunity to expresses their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate what you said, Mr. McWilliam, about sticking to the order, but it is appropriate for me to draw the Committee's attention to the draft statutory rules, which are the Life Sentence Commissioners' Rules 2001. They will underpin the operation of the legislation. Although the Committee has no locus on such instruments, I have made them available, as I did during the wider consultation process, to ensure as much understanding as possible of the draft proposed order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not intend to deal in any detail with the proposed rules, which are comprehensive. It may be inappropriate for me to do so given your earlier ruling, Mr. McWilliam. Separate procedures cover the processing of such instruments. However, I need to deal with some of the main features of the schedules of the draft order and, depending on what issues are raised, I may have to draw on the rules in response as they relate to the schedules. I hope that the Committee and you, Mr. McWilliam, agree with that approach.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me deal with the order and the background to it. The draft proposals for a Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order were published on 15 January, and, as I mentioned, they were referred to the Northern Ireland Assembly for consideration.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has already explained that the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs has deferred consideration of the order to our Committee. The documentation made available to members of our Committee refers to the consideration of the order by the Northern Ireland Assembly. Will the Minister now, or when he replies to the debate after having had an opportunity to reflect, tell us the respective roles and competences of the Committee and the Northern Ireland Assembly? Which of those deliberative bodies has the competence to shape these measures? Do we have primary or secondary competence, in relation to the Assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Let me try to explain, as it will be useful for me to do so now. There is a statutory responsibility on the Government through the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to consult the Northern Ireland Assembly. The 1998 Act specifies a minimum 60-day period for consultative purposes. On matters that relate to the governance of Northern Ireland, the Government are duty bound to hear what the Assembly has to say. However, it does not frame the legislation, as this is a reserved rather than a devolved matter. We are obviously obliged to take into account any views expressed, or the consultation would not be
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0193">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
meaningful. The Northern Ireland Assembly has commented on four key aspects of the order, some of which may be touched on in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have no obligation to consult the Grand Committee but, when dealing with important legislation, it is advisable to do so if the time is available. The hon. Gentleman will have taken on board what I said earlier, which was that we could plan legislation for the Committee to consider, but it could fall if the Committee had to consider an emergency issue. We could not hold up the process of legislation, especially on something as important as the order, which will have a significant impact on the administration of law in Northern Ireland. It must be processed anyway due to human rights considerations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On many occasions, we will adopt the suck-it-and-see approach of whatever is best in the circumstances. We always benefit from debates in the Grand Committee, as they can help the development of specific pieces of legislation. The Order in Council process is always criticised because there is no opportunity for amendment. The opportunity for early input into that process is desirable, but cannot always be provided, because of emergency or other factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft proposals were referred to the Northern Ireland Assembly and to all Northern Ireland Members of Parliament, all party spokespersons on Northern Ireland affairs and all members of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. Everyone in those groups had notice from 15 January of the proposed draft order. As well as being placed in both Houses of Parliament, copies of the proposals were distributed widely across the Northern Ireland criminal justice system and among interested parties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I explained earlier about the 60-day consultation period required under the Northern Ireland Act 1998. It must be allowed before proposals can be laid before Parliament. For the life sentences order, that period ended one week ago today, on Thursday 15 March. By that date, the Secretary of State had received the report of the Northern Ireland Assembly. My officials had additionally received comments from 18 other parties, groups or individuals. If any further comments are received in the next week or so they will of course be taken on board. The views expressed in this Committee will also be fully considered.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is necessary for two reasons. The first is the commencement of the Human Rights Act 1998 on 2 October last year; the second is the report of the Review of the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland. In anticipation of the implementation of the Human Rights Act, the Government undertook a review of prisons legislation with a view to ensuring compliance. An important aspect of the review was a consideration of the arrangements to deal with prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment. The review revealed that current procedures in Northern Ireland for the review and release of discretionary life sentence prisoners and juveniles who have been sentenced to be detained at the Secretary of State's pleasure may be
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
inconsistent with the requirements of the Human Rights Act. Legal advice suggests that HRA compliance would require that, following completion of the punitive element of the sentence, such prisoners' cases should be made subject to periodic review by a judicial body. To have judicial character, such a body should be independent of the Executive and of the parties concerned. It should be impartial and have the power to give a legally binding direction concerning prisoners' release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The recent report of the Northern Ireland criminal justice review endorsed that view. The review group commented on the lack of openness of current procedures—the executive Life Sentence Review Board advises the Secretary of State on release. He then consults the Lord Chief Justice. The review group recommended that an independent body should base its decisions on release mainly on whether a prisoner was a risk to the public. Such a new body should be empowered to make decisions on the release of all life sentence prisoners. The Government accepted the review group's recommendation. They propose arrangements to identify clearly in law a punitive period in all sentences of life or detention at the Secretary of State's pleasure. The relevant prisoners' case for release would be independently assessed and directed at the appropriate time by an independent body of judicial character.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft proposals before the Committee today will, subject to the agreement of Parliament—they must still go before the appropriate Committee in both Houses—introduce such arrangements. The Government are introducing the proposals as a sign of our commitment to human rights standards and principles, and as a positive response to the voice of Northern Ireland. The criminal justice review undertook wide ranging and international research into the relevant matters, and none of those who responded—including Northern Ireland political parties—disagreed with its recommendations in this context. The public consultation period for our draft proposals has just ended, and I believe that there has been widespread welcome for what we are intending to do.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Now that I have given the background to the order, let me deal with the specifics. The explanatory document sets out the key features of the proposals before the Committee. Those features are the appointment of Life Sentence Review Commissioners to consider the cases of life sentence prisoners; the setting of a tariff by the court, after which release can be considered by the commissioners; the power of the commissioners to direct the release of a prisoner on completion of the tariff period, subject to the requirement that release would not present a risk to the public; the entitlement of the prisoner to a hearing of his or her case, including legal representation, when being considered for release by the Commissioners; the attachment of licence conditions on release and the power of the Secretary of State to revoke a prisoner's licence and recall him or her to prison. Those are the key measures. I shall identify additional features of the proposals as I outline the main provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0194">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
Part I—articles 1 and 2—introduces the order and defines key words and phrases used in the draft proposals. Part II includes article 3, which gives the Secretary of State the power to appoint Life Sentence Review Commissioners. Hon. Members will note our approach to the creation of a review group with specific expertise in the key fields of law, psychiatry, psychology, criminology and the rehabilitation of offenders. The Government consider those skills necessary for the assessment of life sentence prisoners for release. The requirements are in accordance with the recommendations of the criminal justice review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The key principle governing the Commissioners' functions is the need to protect the public from serious harm. That must be the basis on which all life sentence prisoners are considered for release. Commissioners must also have regard to the desirability of the rehabilitation of life prisoners and of preventing further offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part III contains all the major provisions of the draft proposed order on the review and release of life sentence prisoners. Article 5 provides for the setting of the tariff by the court. The tariff is a period of retribution and deterrence—sometimes known as the "punishment part" of the sentence—which is ordered by the sentencing judge on conviction. The effect of the provision is to separate a life sentence into two parts, the "punishment part" set by the court and based on the seriousness of the offence or offences involved, and the "risk" period, which falls to the Life Sentence Review Commissioners for consideration. The article also provides the court with the power to order that no tariff be set. That is sometimes known as a "whole life tariff". The Government believe that the court should have a full sentencing range available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There may be occasions when the offences or series of offences are so heinous that a punishment period cannot be set. Although such cases would be extremely rare, we do not think that we should tie the court's hand in the decisions that it can take in that area. To cater for such rare occasions, and to ensure that such prisoners have their sentences reviewed, we have included a provision for the Secretary of State to refer such cases to the Life Sentence Review Commissioners. Referral will be mandatory in the case of a juvenile—we feel that the age of the prisoner is crucial—and discretionary in the case of adults. It will be for the Secretary of State to decide on the point of referral but, in both adult and juvenile cases, if the commissioners direct release, the Secretary of State has a duty to comply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal for the introduction of tariff setting by the court is in accordance with the recommendations of the criminal justice review. It is a fundamental building block in the construction of an independent review process governing life sentences in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 proposes arrangements for the release of life prisoners. The core provisions are that, once the tariff period of the life sentence has been served, a prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the commissioners. If, on consideration of the prisoner's case, the commissioners direct that he
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
should be released, the Secretary of State must release the prisoner on licence. In considering release, the commissioners must be satisfied that confinement is no longer necessary to protect the public from serious harm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is there any provision for an announcement to be made in court at the time of sentence of the punitive tariff in each case, or will the prisoner simply be informed of that privately?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. I shall deal with that in detail during my winding-up speech, if that would assist the hon. and learned Gentleman. The issue is important, because it brings victims' issues into play as well. It concerns the interests of the public as well as those of the defendant.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I can now advise the hon. and learned Gentleman that the tariff will be announced in court at the time of sentence, for the purposes that I have just explained. As I was saying, the commissioners must be satisfied that confinement is no longer necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm. Again, the key principle governing the commissioners' decisions is the need to protect the public from serious harm.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The "punishment part" of the life sentence must be complete and decisions on release will be made on the ground of risk to the public. If a prisoner is refused release by the commissioners, additional provisions in the draft proposals guarantee a maximum "knock-back" period of two years. The proposals to give powers of release to the commissioners are in accordance with the criminal justice review recommendations, and further contribute to the creation of an independent approach to the release of life sentence prisoners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 will allow in exceptional cases life sentence prisoners to be released permanently by the Secretary of State on compassionate grounds. That could occur either before or after the tariff has been completed. However, in taking such decisions, the Secretary of State will be required to consult the commissioners, unless that proves impracticable.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 8 proposes arrangements for the duration and conditions of licences to be imposed on release. Unless the licence is revoked and the prisoner recalled to prison, licences will remain in force for the rest of the released prisoner's life. Licences may require post-release supervision by a probation officer—indeed that would be our expectation and only in rare circumstances would such supervision not be required. Licences will be issued by the Secretary of State and it will be his responsibility to monitor and act on noncompliance, subject to the advice of the police, the probation service, or appropriate agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Again, to ensure independence in licence conditions and effective oversight of them, the Secretary of State must consult the commissioners. It should be stressed that licence conditions can be varied or cancelled. They do not have to exist for the rest of the released prisoner's life. As time passes, the prisoner may settle
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0195">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
in a new life, in which licensing conditions may be no longer relevant. However, the licence itself will exist for life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 9 deals with the recall of life sentence prisoners and provides two means of licence revocation. Both fall to the Secretary of State. The first and principal means will be on the recommendation of the commissioners. It is our intention that in such circumstances any routine advice from a supervising officer would be referred to the commissioners for their consideration. The second method of recall would typically be used in emergency circumstances, where more immediate decisions needed to be taken and a panel of commissioners might not be available.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process would be subject to the advice of the police, the probation service, or appropriate agencies. In all recall cases, prisoners will be advised of the reasons for the revocation and can make representations. All cases will be referred to the commissioners, and if they recommend release, it will be the duty of the Secretary of state to comply.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the limited use that has been made of the power to revoke a licence causes a lot of concern and loss of confidence in Northern Ireland? Will he assure us and the public generally that that will not be influenced by a softly, softly approach in order to avoid offending groups of people who we believe should have been sent back to prison?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If I understand the hon. Gentleman's question, he is referring to those prisoners who have been released under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998. I assume that he is not talking about prisoners who have been released under existing provisions or who will be released under the new provisions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter is all part of the political debate about the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998. The Belfast Agreement provided that it had to be addressed. The Government addressed it, with the full knowledge that the majority of people in Northern Ireland wanted us to proceed with the implementation of the Belfast Agreement. It was not an easy process. It certainly raised many very difficult issues—not only those referred to by the hon. Member for East Antrim, but that of the impact on victims and their families, who bear the immediate grief over the acts committed by those who were in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A different set of issues are at stake here. Under the new proposals, we hope to set out a range of control mechanisms, the application of which should give the public confidence. When considering the release of any prisoner, the commissioners will have to take into account the risk to the public. Apart from the fact that human rights considerations mean that the process must be conducted in that way, it will promote confidence in the system. Only time will tell whether that confidence is secured by the way in which the
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
commissioners and the courts operate, but the Secretary of State will have minimal political involvement in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of those who have been released under existing licensing provisions, eight have been returned to prison. Prisoners on release are subject to law, but they also have human rights entitlements. They cannot be returned to prison just because the dogs in the street say that they are guilty. To protect the principle of the rule of law, we must ensure that everyone's rights are upheld. Although I accept the reasoning on which the hon. Gentleman's question is based, we are dealing with two different sets of circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 9 deals with recalls. All recalls will be made on the ground of risk, and the commissioners have specific statutory functions in that area. All cases will be referred to them for review and recommendation, and the Secretary of State must comply with any direction to release. That is important. The Northern Ireland Assembly has commented on the Secretary of State's powers under the proposal. However, the commissioners will determine any decision, and the Secretary of State must comply with their determination. That should allay any fears about the potential for political interference and is necessary to comply with the Human Rights Act 1998.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 10 provides arrangements to apply the order to transferred or repatriated prisoners from other jurisdictions. In essence, the Secretary of State will consult the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland on the application of the order to the case in question and on the point at which it might apply. The Secretary of State will then certify the prisoner's eligibility and the point at which his case would be considered by the commissioners.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 11 provides the proposed arrangements for prisoners—about 80 in total—currently serving life sentences in Northern Ireland. The provisions are broadly similar to those for transferred or repatriated prisoners, in that the Secretary of State will refer their case to the Lord Chief Justice for his advice and then certify whether and when the order will apply. In effect, that will be a process whereby current prisoners receive a "tariff". On completion of that period, each case will be referred to the commissioners for review and consideration for release.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Any life sentence prisoners currently held on foot of a revocation of licence will not be referred to the court. They will have already been released under current arrangements, having been deemed to have served the appropriate period in custody. They will have been recalled on the ground of risk, and as such will fall to the commissioners. Such cases will therefore be referred straight to them, without the need to go to the court.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 12 provides that any prisoner currently licensed under the Prison Act (Northern Ireland) 1953 or the Criminal Justice (Children) (Northern Ireland) Order 1998–457 prisoners in total—will fall to the commissioners if recalled to prison by the Secretary of State. In such circumstances, the normal recall provisions of giving reasons, allowing representations and commissioners' powers to direct release will apply.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0196">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I stress that such cases become live for the commissioners only if prisoners are recalled to prison. The Secretary of State will have responsibility for monitoring and activation of that process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 13 is a technical provision and provides for the amendment and repeal of current relevant legislative provisions on the release of life sentence prisoners—excluding provisions of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998, which will continue in force.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to the schedules. Schedule 1 provides the arrangements for the appointment of commissioners; the grounds on which they can be dismissed, which can happen only after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice; their payment, allowances, staff and premises; and their disqualification from standing for election to Westminster or the Northern Ireland Assembly. It also requires the chairman to prepare an annual report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Schedule 2 provides for the making of rules governing commissioners' procedures. As I said, the draft rules were issued as part of the consultation process. The key features of schedule 2 are the requirements placed on the Secretary of State to provide the commissioners with relevant evidence and information for them to consider cases, and the ability for proceedings to be held in private. Two particular provisions are worth explaining. The first is the proposal that certain information can be made available only to a commissioner, and withheld from the prisoner being considered for release. The second is the proposal that, in certain circumstances, the prisoner can be excluded from the proceedings of his case and a legal representative appointed on his or her behalf. That would occur when confidential information was being withheld from the prisoner. Those provisions currently apply under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Am I correct to say that no prisoner may make an application until the punitive tariff period has expired—that until then he is positively barred from making an application?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My understanding is that that is correct, but it is in the back of my mind that compassionate circumstances may apply. However, as the provision is framed, the answer to that is yes. I will consider whether compassionate grounds may apply. Someone may have a terminal illness and be at the point of death; compassionate grounds can allow for release in certain circumstances. However, the tariff must be spent before the application can be made. That is my understanding of the provision.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister accept a brief supplementary question, which concerns the fact that certain evidence—certain facts, rather—may be made available to the commissioners in the absence of the prisoner? Do I take it that that means intelligence, rather than evidence, because if it were properly evidence—material, admissible and relevant in a court—the prisoner would be entitled to hear it?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingrain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has a point. It is intelligence that would be withheld, although not necessarily only in matters relating to terrorists or paramilitary prisoners. For example, there could be someone with a mental disability who threatened a psychiatrist who had recommended a course of action. To expose such witnesses giving evidence to the commissioner to the prisoner's presence could put them at risk. It is therefore not necessarily a matter only of intelligence as we commonly know it; it could be a matter of knowing that there is a risk to the witness. I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman accepts that point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second proposal is that prisoners can be excluded from case proceedings and a legal representative appointed on their behalf. As we explained, that would happen in cases in which confidential information is withheld from the prisoner. The Government believe that the provisions are essential for the ability to review cases for release in a complete way. They allow for the supply of information to commissioners that might not otherwise be available, because of danger to the provider, and are designed to cater for the human rights of potential witnesses and society as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In reality, such provisions would not be used frequently. All prisoners who were eligible for release under the sentences Act have been released, and it is in such cases where the provisions are most likely to apply. During the early release programme, we used the provisions only three times. In the unlikely event that a former prisoner went back to prison, the Life Sentence Review Commissioners would need the same capabilities. I explained one example of when the provision would have to be used—when an expert witness's life would be put at risk if he or she were exposed to the prisoner. Hon. Members might be aware that the provisions are currently subject to judicial review. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further, but I repeat that the provisions are designed to cater for the human rights of potential witnesses, victims and society as a whole.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final point relates to the important provisions that have been included to cater for the rights of prisoners throughout the proposed process. In future, life sentence prisoners will have their tariff set in court and will subsequently be referred to the independent Life Sentence Review Commissioners at the appropriate time, who will assess the case for release based on their professional and expert knowledge. When cases are considered, prisoners will be entitled to a hearing and legal representation, subject to the conditions that we have just discussed. Legal aid regulations have been amended to provide for the Life Sentence Review Commissioners' business.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I remind hon. Members of the reasons for the Government drafting proposals for a life sentences order for Northern Ireland. There is a need for life sentence review and release arrangements to comply with the Human Rights Act 1998 and the recommendations of the review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. The Government believe that the time has come in Northern Ireland to transfer
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0197">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
responsibility for such matters out of the hands of Ministers. Tariff setting will fall to the court, and release decisions will fall to an independent group of judicial character that will be created with the necessary expertise. The proposals cater for the needs of society and the rights of prisoners, and I recommend them to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. McWilliam.

Had there been consideration through the usual channels of the convenience of this date, I might have made representation to the effect that another date might have been more convenient. However, I am here. I am not being churlish, but if neither the Minister nor I decides, and my right hon. and hon. Friends from the Province have no hand in the matter, who does decide? Who plays God?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I almost said me. The correct answer to the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Further to that point of order, Mr. McWilliam. I would have found it extremely agreeable to be in Belfast on Monday.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The issue of prisoner release has been— and still is—at the forefront of the minds of many people in Northern Ireland, including, of course, the many victims in the Province. References to "early prisoner release" understandably produce a bad taste in the mouths of many. It is unfortunate that such terminology is used in the order. The term "early
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
release scheme" reminds people of a scheme that we wish had never been conducted at all. Let us hope that this scheme, which deals with the future procedures for the release of life prisoners, goes someway to restoring public confidence in the Northern Ireland criminal justice system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the current mechanism for the return to prison of those released as a result of the Belfast agreement, there is little public confidence in the ability to revoke licences. It must be remembered that when the security forces spot a known member of a terrorist organisation near the home of a police officer, for example, collecting information on a potential target, that is terrorism. The threat of violence is terrorism as much as the act. The latent influence is still intact, and decommissioning is necessary for the removal of that influence. Let us hope that the revocation of licences under this scheme is less politicised than that of those operated under the agreement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my first area of concern over the commission—the objectivity of the commission or, more accurately, its independence from Government, which was rightly highlighted by the Assembly Committee that considered the order. I am more than aware that independence does not always provide proper decision making. One needs only to consider the naivety of the many supposedly independent human rights bodies in Northern Ireland to prove that. It must be remembered that a "proper decision" is one that takes into account those factors that must be taken into account, and only those factors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In order to protect the independence of the commission, it might have been prudent to provide the commissioners with security for a fixed period, such as the suggested five years. That might be considered in future when the commission is running, therefore maintaining a constantly high level of experience among the commissioners. On the powers to dismiss commissioners, it might have been more appropriate that commissioners be compulsorily removed after the commission of a criminal offence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 provides for the Secretary of State to grant a licence on conditional grounds without consulting the commission, where doing so would be impractical. It would never be impractical to do so if the commission retained a rolling assessment of each prisoner's propensity to abscond or re-offend while on licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In considering the order, the Assembly Committee also highlighted the period of the licence. It has been suggested that the duration of the licence on release—for life—is in some way unfair. If a member of the public, perhaps a relative of a murder victim, asked me after the sentencing of the murderer what life imprisonment meant, how could I reasonably answer? After all, the "tariff" dictates the point of reconsideration for release. The only assurance that a victim can be given is that the offender will serve a period in prison as punishment and will remain on licence for the rest of his life. A lifetime on licence is not harsh.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0198">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
As well as making recommendations on licences, the Assembly Committee considered victims' rights. At present, it would be wholly inappropriate for victims to have a say in whether a prisoner should be released on licence. It may be appropriate at some point in future if victims are given a role in initial sentencing—if they are permitted to make representations before sentence—but not before such reform occurs.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many other issues that merit further discussion were raised in previous consideration of the order. However, one especially pressing concern has not been allayed by previous discussion, to my knowledge. I refer to article 6(6). I hope that the Minister can provide me with a logical explanation of its purpose. It enables the Secretary of State to direct that "time…at large" is taken into consideration in determining the relevant part of a prisoner's sentence. Therefore, a prisoner "at large" or on the run could be suitable for early release under the scheme even if he had not served the relevant period in prison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When one takes into account the fact that the order applies to existing life prisoners through article 11, the possibilities of the paragraph become more apparent. The impact for escapees who have not served their time could in theory be imprisonment and immediate release after a direction by the Secretary of State and a decision of the commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many references to the serving of "the relevant part" of a sentence. The judiciary should ensure that meaningful minimum time will be served before life sentence prisoners qualify for release on licence. There should be consistency in sentencing throughout the United Kingdom, so that Northern Ireland does not become a transfer haven for prisoners convicted outside the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What assurance can the public have that the order will not lead to a spate of miraculous recoveries after release on compassionate grounds? I am sure that the Minister will agree that if there were too many such cases, the exceptional circumstances provision would be discredited for victims and society generally.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From my experience with offending former pupils, probation officers have such heavy case loads that there is not always sufficient time for frequent and regular contact with ex-offenders on probation for less serious offences. Will the Minister assure us that when the Secretary of State makes rules for regulating supervision of released lifers on licence, he will also make provision to monitor the application of those rules?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although the wholesale release on licence of convicted murderers, whether labelled loyalist or republican, has been extremely sickening in the continuing absence of decommissioning of illegal weapons, we must accept that all existing life prisoners should be treated equally on the possibility of release on licence. Many people in Northern Ireland lack confidence in the absence of political pressures and the latent influence on decision making on licence revocation. The potential for exploitation of article 6(6) could further damage confidence. I hope that the Minister can allay my concerns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Finally, and perhaps most crucially, I am pleased to note that the Minister is satisfied that the order complies with human rights legislation, and that it will not create a spate of legal appeals to the European Court funded by legal aid at the taxpayer's expense.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To conclude, the order will be generally welcomed by Ulster Unionists if it creates further accountability and transparency in sentencing and lessens potential conflict between the Human Rights Act 1998 and the life sentence procedure. I hope that the Minister will respond to our concerns in his winding-up speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.5 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) has detailed the concerns of public representatives in Northern Ireland about the implementation of the order. As I understand it, the aspiration that the order is intended to encapsulate is that the public should be protected, that the human rights of prisoners should be observed and that decisions should be taken by a body independent of the Executive.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>THE CHAIRMAN'S 	<i>attention having been called to the fact that ten Members were not present, he suspended the proceedings; and other Members having come into the room and ten Members being present, the proceedings were resumed.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order is proposed because of the requirement that the law in this part of the United Kingdom should conform with human rights legislation. That is welcome, but must be viewed against the background of the application of prisoner release in Northern Ireland—an issue raised by the hon. Member for East Antrim. If human rights legislation is to be implemented and the protection of the public is to be of the highest order—we are now legislating to ensure that—the breaches of human rights and of the rule of law that were committed by Executive action for the purpose of political expediency are thrown into bold relief.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One difficulty that will arise is the implementation of the order on the basis of human rights given the existence of a large body of persons sentenced to life for heinous offences who have been released by Executive action in clear and apparent breach of the principles of human rights and the rule of law. That is to some extent justified, it is alleged by the Minister, because the people of Northern Ireland in some form of referendum okayed a breach of the rule of law and the principles of human rights—a breach that the order acknowledges to have been fundamental. It is now apparent that, under the order, the Executive actions taken to release prisoners in Northern Ireland under the so-called Good Friday agreement would have been unlawful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although many people will properly welcome the order, they will say, "How come, if the fundamental principle is the protection of the public, someone such as Michael Carraher, who personally executed 12 British citizens including Lance Bombardier Restorick, can be released after serving 18 months?" There was no question of a punitive tariff. If a punitive
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0199">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
tariff had been properly applied in that case, a person who took 12 lives would be at the top end of it—but he was released.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Michael Carraher is only one of many on both sides, because I take the same view of both loyalist and republican terrorists. They are the most abhorrent human specimens imaginable, but they have been released on the basis of Executive action in breach of human rights. It is now being said that that action was in some way justified because the people of Northern Ireland approved it in a referendum, but they approved it because, the day before the referendum, a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom gave those people undertaking—in his own handwriting, publicly, in newspapers and on television—that no prisoners would be released until they had eschewed violence permanently, given up their arms and stopped terroristic activities, including beating other human beings with iron bars, crucifying them and shooting them in the knees, ankles and wrists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were promised that all those activities would cease, but they have not ceased and, in many areas, they have escalated. Therefore, although I welcome decisions made on such issues by an independent body, free from Executive control, it throws into bold relief the Executive action taken for political purposes. There is nothing more corrosive of the human spirit—as a barrister and senior counsel for longer than I care to remember, I am very much aware of this—than a sense of injustice. There is no greater injustice than for people to see the Government acting in fundamental breach of the rules of justice, the rule of law and everything that has made the administration of justice in the United Kingdom a model for the world. So I welcome the order, but I am sorry that it comes in the wake of Executive action that is a disgrace to democracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.12 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will not say much, but a few things must be said. I will not trespass on the points made so powerfully by the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister drew attention to the fact that a sentence is divided into two parts, but I see no way in which the punitive part of the sentence can be determined other than by the court. Therefore, the court has immense discretion in this matter—I see that the Minister agrees. It is also clear that, at some point, the punitive part of the sentence ends and the individual enters a period of rehabilitation, during which he is supposed to become fit for release and learn to live among ordinary decent folk, instead of living in the terrorist world from which so many prisoners come. During that period, the individual may be considered for release. However, the proposed order applies not only to terrorist prisoners but to all life prisoners. So I want to ask whether different approaches will be taken towards those who are sentenced for terrorist offences and those who are in prison for other crimes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
There are always some prisoners who are considered to be so dangerous that they should never be released. I am certain that no one in the Committee would deny that. Under the Belfast agreement, all terrorist prisoners were all let out. Yet that large group included men and women who, in normal circumstances, would never have been let out. Those people are out in the community not as a result of legalities but as a result of political deals being done. We have to accept that. I would be glad to hear the Minister say why they were released without consideration of the danger that they pose to the public, but I do not expect to hear a satisfactory answer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another interesting situation has now arisen. The Home Secretary recently said that he will tighten up on those who commit violent crime and that a much harsher line will be taken on all sorts of crime by changing the law. He also made it clear that police throughout the United Kingdom should make it clear that no matter when murders were committed, those who committed them will be pursued and imprisoned. There is widespread welcome among the press and the public, and in the Government, for the fact that forensic science is now so advanced that people have recently been arrested and charged with murders committed more than 30 years ago. That same Government did a deal with the Provisional IRA and others not to pursue people on the run for committing the most heinous murders on the island of Ireland and elsewhere, on behalf of terrorist organisations pursuing political and constitutional changes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Can the Minister give a satisfactory explanation for those two totally different approaches to murder? It will require far more than saying, "Oh, things are different in Ireland." The relatives of the dead do not consider it to be "different in Ireland". Such murders are not different; they are far worse than murders committed for financial gain or in the heat of the moment in Great Britain. I believe that, by taking such an attitude, the Government have sunk to the bottom depths of the devil's morality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said something else that was worthy of comment. He said that when considering who should be released, the age of juveniles would be critical. No one in this Room would deny that that is an important factor, because many young people are sucked into violence; they are pressured and used by older and much worse people to commit the most dreadful crimes. Children as young as 14 and 15 years old have been used—and are still being used, if only to throw stones in the streets. Those young people have been deliberately taken into a society by older and more evil people in which violence is seen as the means of getting one's way. We live with that every day and every weekend in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the physical age of individuals is to be taken into account, can the Minister say whether their mental age should be taken into account? We know that many of those young people were of lesser ability; they were easily led and subjected to pressure. I should like my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0200">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
concern about youth circumstances to be answered. Sometimes the involvement of older people also needs to be taken into account in such matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, the Assembly reports are available, so we can find out what the politicians there thought about the proposal. However, we have not seen the comments of other bodies. In future, when we come here to discuss similar orders, we should have seen not only the Assembly debates but the opinions of other bodies. Those are relevant too, and they might colour our judgments and conclusions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.20 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McWalter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am perplexed on one point and seek an assurance. It concerns paragraph 4 of the evidence submitted by Professor Livingstone of Queen's University, Belfast, set out in the Ad Hoc Committee report. He identifies two apparently conflicting issues on which the Life Sentence Review Commissioners would make decisions. Article 6(4)(b) of the order relates to the commissioners having regard to the possibility of serious offences being committed by people released after serving the punitive part of their sentence. I am worried about that. It appears to be the main criterion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Professor Livingstone mentions that a different article—3(4)(b)—allows a wider view of what is to be taken into account in considering release. The concern under article 3(4)(b) with avoiding further offences is very different from the idea of avoiding further serious offences. There seems to be a conflict. I am particularly worried that, if the commissioners have regard only to the possibility of further serious offences, it may be possible on release for the people concerned to harass those who gave evidence against them, or to employ niggling tactics that could be threatening and unpleasant, without falling foul of the requirement to commit no further serious offences.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want my right hon. Friend to take Professor Livingstone's submission very seriously. In studying paragraph 4, he should keep in mind, in relation to the Life Sentence Review Commissioners' consideration of the possibility of serious offences being committed by those who are to be released, whether those people would also be deemed likely to commit offences of aggravated nuisance or to engage in similar activity that would destabilise the community.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.23 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: At the beginning of these deliberations I mentioned that in Northern Ireland we do not like Orders in Council. In fact, we thought that under the new arrangements there would be very few, and that new measures would proceed in the normal way through Parliament as for Scotland and Wales. The draft order is made under section 85 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, but section 84 states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"(2) Her Majesty may by Order in Council make such amendments of the law of any part of the United Kingdom as appear to Her Majesty to be necessary or expedient in consequence of any provision made by or under-</p></blockquote>
	<ol>
	<li>Northern Ireland legislation; or</li>
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
	<li>any Act of Parliament passed before this Act in so far as the provision is part of the law of Northern Ireland.</li></ol>
	<br><blockquote><p>(3) An Order in Council under subsection (1) or (2) may contain such consequential and supplemental provisions as appear to Her Majesty to be necessary or expedient."</p></blockquote>
That suggests that new legislation should go through Parliament in the usual manner, and that only a consequential change to an Act or a supplemental provision should be enacted through Order in Council. As the measure is not consequential or supplemental to the Act, it should go through Parliament as a Bill and be debated in the House. That is what we would like.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister said that this is a draft order. He indicated that he would consider representations; presumably, he will allow amendments. Does that mean that the order will be laid again in Parliament and debated in the House? Perhaps he will clarify that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It appears that there will now be three parts to a sentence: the retribution and deterrent parts, which will be decided by a judge when a person is sentenced; and a subsequent risk period after the sentence is completed, which will be determined by the new commissioners. Are the three parts included when a judge passes sentence at present? In future, will judges give reduced sentences? For an offence that would currently receive a sentence of 20 years, will a judge pass a sentence of 15 years, with the additional part for risk to be decided by the commissioners? In practice, that will mean that judges will pass lesser sentences and prisoners will be released earlier. I do not think that the people of Northern Ireland would look favourably on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Part of the order deals with release on compassionate grounds. Criteria whereby the Secretary of State might judge what are compassionate grounds would be desirable. There have been cases of prisoners being released on compassionate grounds because of terminal illness who, on release, miraculously recovered and now live perfectly healthy lives. We need some criteria as to what is meant by "compassion". Changes might be necessary to the system due to human rights legislation, but the Minister should consider the excellent report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Northern Ireland Assembly, as it makes several worthwhile recommendations. I hope that he will assure us that they will be considered, that changes will be made if he thinks them necessary, and that a new draft order will be made.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with some specifics, first those arising from comments made by the hon. Member for East Antrim and others, including the hon. and learned Member for North Down. The order should not be confused with the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998 on the early release of terrorist prisoners. When Northern Ireland matters are considered, our debates tend to cover a gamut of issues that relate to the Belfast agreement, divided between those who support its principles and recognise the difficulty of implementing it, and those who oppose it and do not want it to succeed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have said time and again that the release of prisoners was not an easy process for the Government to address. It does not mean that the Government have a lesser view of the severity of the crimes carried out by those individuals, nor that we are unaware of the affects of those crimes on individuals, families and the wider community in Northern Ireland. For that reason, we have introduced a progressive series of initiatives to try to deal sensitively with victims. Those victims were forgotten about for the previous 30 years, but the Government have taken the issue on board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I regret that others sometimes tend to exploit people's victimhood and try to ignore what the Government have done. I am not referring specifically to the hon. Member for East Antrim, but making a general point. I do not accept any criticism of the Government's handling of the issue of victims. We continue to seek imaginative ways to deal with the serious trauma and grief in the community. The hon. Member for East Antrim and I had a helpful and purposeful meeting the day before yesterday with some of his constituents, to deal with some of the difficult issues currently in play in his constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order is not about the early release of prisoners. It is about the transparency of the sentencing process in court and the entitlement to a point at which the punishment part of a sentence has been spent so that release can be considered. The order is not a soft option; it does not say that prisoners are somehow society's fault, so we should be soft on them. If anything, the reverse is the case: introducing a tariff process makes the punishment part of the sentence transparent. However, as was mentioned, that will always fall to the court to determine. The tariff process is a matter for courts to determine, not politicians.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Life imprisonment is for life. Let me put it this way; there is a tariff—the prisoner will be released at some point—and at the end of the punishment period, judgment will be made about whether the prisoner constitutes a risk to the public. If, in the judgment of all expert advice, the answer is no, the prisoner can be released, but importantly, it is release on licence. That licence runs for the rest of their lives and conditions can be set—I explained earlier that those conditions may be varied or dropped. On many occasions, people who have committed the most terrible crimes have
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
recognised the error of their ways, changed their lifestyle and made a useful contribution to society. However, if they are out on licence, that licence remains with them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that all hon. Members recognise that people can change their lifestyle. They may have carried out acts as a young person because they were misled or encouraged by others down a certain path, but, when they are older, realise that they should not have done so. There must be compassion within the system; we must at all times consider the rehabilitation of those who have committed crimes. That is a purpose of the Prison Service, but it must also be addressed by society. We should not turn our face against people, no matter what their crime. We should consider whether we could rehabilitate them and give them a way back into normal society. All of society should be engaged in that process; but politicians have an important role in that regard.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The role of victims in the judicial process was considered by the criminal justice review. That is an important matter that is not addressed by the order; but, of course, submissions on victims' issues can be considered by the court when sentencing. We are now considering how best to take forward the detailed consideration undertaken by the review; a Bill to give effect to its recommendations will deal with the issue of victims.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McWalter</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Might not it be possible to use the system of antisocial behaviour orders in that regard? The commissioners could be empowered to impose an antisocial behaviour order with appropriate terms, which could be sensitive to the fears of victims and would be an easily revoked condition on the licence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is a good point, but I would hesitate to agree to it now. That falls to be considered by the proposed justice Bill, which will deal with the recommendations of the criminal justice review. The review considered how best to deliver justice, with all its ramifications—punishment, rehabilitation and the needs of victims. That Bill may not address my hon. Friend's specific point but will touch upon such matters. I am grateful for his comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the proposed Bill a United Kingdom Bill?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. I do not want to talk about a Bill that has not yet been mentioned in a Queen's speech.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The criminal justice review made more than 300 recommendations. If the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) has not an opportunity to read the report, I suggest that he does so. He may even want to talk to those who were consulted; as a Member of Parliament, he is a consultee and can make submissions. We are currently considering those consultations, and a Bill will be published in the normal course of events. It will be drafted on the back of the recommendations. We shall then consult on it and allow a full examination of its provisions on the administration and delivery of justice in Northern Ireland. It comes out of the Good Friday agreement.

	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
The Belfast agreement recognises the need for a Bill. It is another matter that the Government have taken forward under that agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What is not clear is whether the hon. Member for East Londonderry would like it to be included in the Queen's Speech.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I assume that that was an intervention on me. I try to read the mind of the hon. Member for East Londonderry, but I do not always succeed. He could intervene on me and say whether or not that is the correct interpretation—I would recommend that he says yes. It is not for Ministers to go about looking for additional work, but that important examination of the corpus of law in Northern Ireland has been warmly welcomed. The Government are committed to bringing forward that legislation, but I cannot say when.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Antrim asked about the commission's membership. All of its members will be appointed independently, but one must be an officer of the court and it will include a barrister and other professionals. I listed earlier some of the professions that would be asked to serve. We want it to provide a breadth and quality of assessment when dealing with sensitive and difficult cases. The commission's role will never be easy; it will have to make fine judgments about difficult cases. It will be acting in the name of the wider public and society. We must put certain specialist expertise in place so that the commission's decisions are made in the interests of all, and not only of those who are being considered.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that, whether or not it is justified, Northern Ireland appointments to the Human Rights Commission are seen as unbalanced. As a result, wide sections of the community have lost confidence in it. I subscribe to that view: I have no confidence in it. I therefore suggest to the Minister that the review commission is seen to represent the whole community in a way that the representations of the Human Rights Commission do not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not rise to the bait. That matter has been debated elsewhere. However, I take on board the importance of trying to establish a commission that has the confidence of the wider public. I am sure that the hon. and learned Gentleman accepts that it is better to put the emphasis on the quality of the commissioners rather than on their perceived religious or political affiliations. We are dealing with the processes relating to normal society, not those relating to criminality in the guise of terrorism or paramilitarism. The hon. and learned Gentleman's point will be made when we consider who should serve as commissioners. Given the problems that commissioners will face and the hostile reactions that there may be to some of their decisions, it might be difficult to get people to serve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Antrim referred to the length of the appointment. We are considering five years, but will deliberate on the matter. He raised a point in relation to article 6(6) and referred to
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
prisoners at large. That part of the order provides that, in exceptional circumstances, for example, if a prisoner is in prison elsewhere, the Secretary of State may take that period into account. In any legislation, it is necessary to allow some scope for discretion to allow for mitigating circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The assessment of the provision made by the hon. Member for East Londonderry was correct. There are two parts to any sentence by the courts, including a punitive element, but that is a matter to be determined by the court. I did not understand the hon. Gentleman's point. Does he think that it should not be a court-based decision, and if so, whom does he think should make the decision? Should it be politicians or the Secretary of State? I caution the hon. Gentleman against following that course because that decision should rest with the court, so that everyone's rights are protected.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He also asked how the Secretary of State's judgments will apply to juveniles in the system and whether mental age will be taken into account. The answer is not per se. Mental age will not be taken into account in determining criminality, but the mental health legislation will apply, so there will be some protection. I understand the issue raised by the hon. Gentleman, and it might help if I write to him and set out the situation in detail.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the debate about the release of terrorist prisoners under the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998, it is worth putting in context how that Act relates to this proposed order. Any life prisoner currently on licence under the 1998 Act will continue to be the responsibility of the Secretary of State and the sentence review commissioners, who will be responsible for taking revocation decisions. If someone on licence under the 1998 Act were to have his licence revoked, he would continue to be allowed to apply to the commissioners if his circumstances changed or fresh information came to light. However, there needs to be a routine vehicle for considering the release of such prisoners. That will be the draft proposed Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001 and the Life Sentence Review Commissioners. Therefore, there will be two avenues for considering the re-release of recalled prisoners who were on licence under the 1998 Act. Indeed, that is already the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry also raised the matter of prisoners who might have escaped from prison in Northern Ireland and are outwith the jurisdiction and recent decisions relating to them. Are we rewarding such individuals? No, we are not. They are being dealt with in a manner that is entirely consistent with the way in which we have dealt with those already released under the sentences Act. They will all have served sufficient time to meet the minimum requirements of that Act; in some cases significantly more. On outstanding cases, the Chief Constable has stated that his officers will continue to pursue with zeal those people who have committed offences but have yet to be brought to justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The arrangements that have been announced by the Government following the decision not to pursue the extradition of certain convicted fugitives do not apply
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0203">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
to people sought by the police but not yet convicted. I know that Committee members will agree that it would help the process of making Northern Ireland a better society if anyone with information on any of those unsolved crimes would come forward. If we are to become a new society based on the rule of law recognised by everyone, linked to the political process, then everyone has obligations. Genuine democrats, if they know where the miscreants are, should say so. There is a lot of pain and grief out there, as well as many unsolved crimes. That is not because of a lack of effort on the part of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the various agencies that work alongside the police, but because people will not come forward with evidence. Sometimes it is because they are intimidated—we can understand that that can be a very real threat—but we want to build a new, different and better society in Northern Ireland and we need everyone who has information and evidence to help us to do that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) made a very thoughtful contribution, for which I am grateful. I take on board his points about specific details, including the comments of Professor Livingstone. I have said that we are in listening mode—any contribution that will enable us to refine and better define the purpose of the order will be carefully considered. If I do not change the order in the way in which he suggested, I shall let him know the reason in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) made a number of points, some general and some specific. He ran through the arguments in relation to Orders in Council and the way in which such issues are dealt with. I do not necessarily disagree with him in general. As a democrat, I am not comfortable with the Orders in Council procedure. I should prefer to see matters fully debated and completely subject to a debate in which they can be changed. However, that is not the way in which the current provisions apply.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always looked at ways in which we can take the matter forward. That is why, if we introduce legislation that falls into the non-devolved area under the Northern Ireland Act 1998, we are obliged by law to consult the Northern Ireland Assembly. That is appropriate. It is right that there should be consultation and that it should make observations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Assembly has expressed concern that the consultation period is 60 days. It made that observation in relation to this order, and to the one that we shall consider later today. No doubt it will be said in relation to every consultation that we have. Sixty days seems to me to be a reasonable length of time. Special pleading was made that there were difficulties associated with a particular piece of legislation. We are mindful of the difficulties that legislative bodies might experience, so what I have said is not necessarily the top and bottom of the matter. However, we need a period in law that conditions everyone's minds. Sometimes Governments, acting in
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
response to pressure—maybe from the Assembly— enact a piece of legislation. If we allowed for open-ended consultation there would be a tendency for that to drift.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another area to be considered in relation to Orders in Council is this Committee. We meet four times a year. I take on board the point about where the meetings should be. The decision is not mine, but as I have said I am not unsympathetic to the idea that it is important for deliberative bodies to be brought closer to the people. On the body that concerns us, the Government are not hostile to the view that has been expressed, but the overall decision rests elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that I have covered the gamut of the points that were raised—or maybe not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand the Minister's arguments, but they are weak. Why could not the order have begun as a Bill and passed through the House to become an Act? It is not mandatory for the Government to deal with the matter by way of an order. Passing an Act would be a more suitable way to deal with a part of the United Kingdom than the colonial system of Orders in Council.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman may think that my arguments are weak, but his contributions are sometimes right over the top. The system is not colonial. If the hon. Gentleman wants home rule for Northern Ireland, perhaps he should go and articulate that view elsewhere. The present process has been established because of the ungovernability of Northern Ireland, which is due to many factors not directly under the Government's control. It is not for this Committee to tackle all those issues now.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The matter could be considered on the Floor of the House, but Northern Ireland is only one constituent part of the United Kingdom, although it is an important part that takes much Government attention. I shall write to the hon. Gentleman setting out every item of primary legislation that the Government have introduced. It is a considerable number, and while the hon. Gentleman did not agree with all the measures, they were none the less fully debated in both Houses of Parliament. It is not possible to deal with every piece of legislation as the hon. Gentleman suggests. Every Department wants many matters to be presented for consideration by the House. In any parliamentary Session it is not possible to satisfy all those departmental needs. That is the reason for the Queen's Speech. It is why the Government must refine things down to the matters that are of prime importance to the different constituent parts of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is another factor determining the need for the order. It is needed to comply with the Human Rights Act 1998. If it had to wait in line with all the other measures that the Government are considering, we would be out of compliance with the Act during that time. I do not want that. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees that Governments should comply fully with the Human Rights Act, not only, as in this case, to protect people in prison, but to protect the interests of society in general.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Surely the Minister acknowledges that, because there is now a devolved Parliament in Scotland, there is more time for other matters to be dealt with in the House.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No. The Government have introduced a great deal of legislation. The fact that a part of the United Kingdom is devolved, with legislative powers—which, indeed, the Northern Ireland Assembly has, too—does not create gaps in the legislative programme. Other matters move into the gaps. I have tried to explain that Governments must reduce the number of measures in their programmes in accordance with parliamentary Sessions. It is not true that devolution of Scotland and Northern Ireland results in empty slots.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have permitted this exchange to continue for a while, but it does not arise from the order.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I became wound up while arguing for my cause. I accept your ruling, Mr. McWilliam.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Notwithstanding some of the criticisms that have been made of the process that has been used, the Order is an important measure. It brings the United Kingdom into compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998 as I have explained, and provides important protection to people in prison, as well as wider society.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
