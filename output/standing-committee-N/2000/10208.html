	<section>
	<div class='title'>Cancer Services</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>1. 	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What representations he has made to the Chancellor and the First Minister over increased funding to develop cancer services in Northern Ireland. [148627]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: None. It is a matter for Ministers in the devolved Administration, whose officials deal directly with Her Majesty's Treasury as necessary on day-to-day funding issues of that kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's response, but he will be aware that the Select Committee on Science and Technology presented a fine report on the necessity for cancer services in which it paid tribute to what was happening in Northern Ireland. However, it is estimated that £25 million is needed to bring services up to the required standard in Northern Ireland, which has been deprived of proper cancer services for years. Now that a lead role is being played within Europe and internationally, will the Northern Ireland Office support the First Minister and others in pressing the Treasury for the money that is needed, not only for Northern Ireland, but for the whole United Kingdom?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is right. As twice former Northern Ireland health Minister, I am aware of the fine work that has been done in the past and that continues. However, it is a matter for the Assembly and the Executive. The 2000 spending review set firm three-year spending plans for all Government Departments and devolved Administrations. The allocation of public expenditure among the services controlled by the Northern Ireland Executive is for the devolved Administration to determine. However, we make appropriate representations to the Treasury when there is an obvious case to be made on behalf of Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was surprised to see that this question had been tabled because I thought that cancer services in Northern Ireland, as in Scotland, are a devolved matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I make a plea to the Minister that any discussion with Mrs. de Brún, or other Northern Ireland Assembly Members, will not overlook the concerns of people who suffer from prostate cancer. Does he agree that prostate cancer treatment has been deplorably underfunded everywhere in the United Kingdom, that more research needs to be carried out and that much more money needs to be spent on the treatment of that killer?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have a great deal of sympathy with the sentiment behind my hon. Friend's question, as I have lost close personal friends and members of my family to prostate cancer. I will ensure that his concerns are passed on to the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
</section>
	<section>
	<div class='title'>Punishment Beatings</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2. 	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: If he will make a statement about punishment beatings in Northern Ireland. [148628]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: These brutal attacks are completely the opposite of what the Good Friday agreement is about. In the agreement, people voted for a new start and for a society based on the rule of law. The attacks are carried out by ruthless people who seek to exercise power and control over their communities through fear and acts of intimidation. Those who sanction them and carry them out are the enemies of a transition to a peaceful society in Northern Ireland. By their actions, they show contempt for human life and the human rights of their fellow citizens. The Government unreservedly condemn these attacks, from whatever quarter, and call upon anyone with information on them to co-operate with the police and help to create the new and better society afforded by the Good Friday agreement.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is it not true that as conventional terrorism—whatever that is; one must not be reconciled to it—occurs less frequently in Northern Ireland, beatings and, in particular, banishment have increased alarmingly, and that 1,000 people have been forced to move to the mainland since the Belfast agreement was signed? Is that not the very enemy of anything called a peace process?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with the hon. Gentleman's conclusion, as I made clear when I set out the Government's view. There is no question that paramilitary assaults continue at an alarming and unacceptable rate and that people—sometimes whole families—are forcibly exiled from their communities. I welcome the investigation that the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs is undertaking into that aspect of Northern Ireland society and I await its report with considerable interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0167">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is my right hon. Friend aware that, according to Royal Ulster Constabulary figures, in periods of ceasefire or during the peace process, paramilitary intimidation shootings reduce dramatically but are replaced entirely by paramilitary beatings? As horrific as the shootings are, the beatings are horrendous. To quote Professor Knox and Dr. Monaghan:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Beatings are carried out using weapons such as baseball bats, golf clubs, pickaxe handles, drills, iron bars, hammers, and hurley sticks spiked with nails to inflict puncture wounds."</p></blockquote>
Some people choose to be shot in their legs rather than to be sent into exile; whether they would choose the beatings, which are worse in many ways than the shootings, is doubtful. Should not paramilitaries end those barbarities, especially paramilitary groups that have political wings operating in the Northern Ireland Executive?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The only bit of that speech that was a question was the last sentence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall answer that question. I agree, and the Government have constantly called for all those groups, no matter from which quarter, to cease those activities. Those who claim to support the Good Friday agreement should recognise that any organisation carrying out such actions in their name acts inimically to the Good Friday agreement and all that for which the people of Northern Ireland voted. I agree with thrust of my hon. Friend's comments.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Given that there are so many beatings but very few apprehensions and convictions of those who commit them, are the Government concerned and what other measures do they think might be necessary to secure more convictions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Again, I agree that there are too many such incidents and too few arrests, charges and subsequent convictions. We have found that people do not come forward as witnesses; and if they do, they sometimes back off at the last moment, just before or even during the trial. The Government have to encourage people, through witness protection programmes and by creating a more normalised society, to engage with society and be brave enough to give evidence against those who carry out the beatings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The other part of the approach is to get the message over to the people who carry out the actions that that is not what people want: they are a denial of human rights and the opposite of all that the Good Friday agreement stands for. Rather than chase headlines, the more people who say that and stand up to those people, the better the chance we have of succeeding.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that no matter how often we, as elected representatives, condemn and deplore that behaviour, it suits the purposes of the paramilitary organisations to extend control over the areas in which they operate? Rather than looking to a situation in which RUC numbers are depleted, should we not give greater attention to improving resources to gain the convictions to which my hon. Friend the Member for
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) referred? We will not gain control of the situation unless we have positive results and prosecutions, because there is widespread fear in communities of supplying evidence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: There are resource implications related to that issue. I am confident that the Chief Constable is tackling the problem with as much vigour as possible by the deployment of resources on the ground. However, it is implicit in the hon. Gentleman's comments that he agrees with my analysis. At the end of the day, it is the members of the community who must come forward as witnesses and give evidence. On too many occasions, young people end up in hospital as a result of shootings and beatings but will not say what happened, or stand up to the bully boys and thugs who commit such offences. Changing that attitude is a difficult process in which we are involved. The problem concerns all elected representatives, community groups and members of civic society in Northern Ireland, who must totally condemn such behaviour to give courage to both the victims of assaults and those whom we need to come forward as witnesses of assaults.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that it is unreal to expect people who are the victims of alleged punishment beatings and live in ghetto areas under the control of paramilitary groups to give evidence against those who have injured them or others? Their families—brothers, sisters and children—live in areas where adequate police protection cannot be afforded. Does the Minister also agree that there is no political sanction against the paramilitaries because the duty of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is to view in the round the essentially political decision of whether groups are in breach of their ceasefire, but officials from the Northern Ireland Office can say that a murder of a community member, such as Charles Bennett, is not a breach of ceasefire because it is merely a matter of internal housekeeping?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not underestimate the difficulties that victims and those in the community have in coming forward. However, if we are to succeed, we need people to stand up and be counted as we do in any normal, civil society. Given the threats of violence, that is a big demand to make of people, so we must put in place support mechanisms. Those should rest not only with the Northern Ireland Office or the security forces, but with the wider community too, who, as I mentioned, must play their part in the condemnation of violence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of how a ceasefire is analysed and acted upon, attribution usually rests with the Chief Constable. He or the security forces gives us advice on attribution; civil servants do not act on their own volition in that respect.

We do not hold statistics because that would mean that we had information, and we do not have such information.

	<p>3. 	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What additional measures he is taking to enhance security in Northern Ireland. [148629]</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Secretary of State keeps the security situation under constant review. He and I receive regular briefings on it from the Chief Constable and our security advisers. Operational security measures are a matter for the Chief Constable, who keeps security at a level appropriate to his assessment of the prevailing threat.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that security is a matter for the consideration of the Chief Constable, yet are not the Government engaged in secret negotiations involving Sinn Fein-IRA? The agenda contains major proposals for a downscaling of security in Northern Ireland, including the proposed dismantling of two watchtowers in South Armagh and further moves to scale down the RUC, especially the full-time RUC Reserve, yet security threats and terrorist activity are increasing and there is a crime wave on our streets. Surely the Government's first priority in Northern Ireland is the protection of its citizens. Will the Minister assure us that the Government will not barter their security—and that of the people of the whole of the United Kingdom—for simple political expediency?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I give the hon. Gentleman an absolute assurance to that effect. His implied criticism of the Northern Ireland security forces ill behoves him. They do a very difficult job in very difficult circumstances. He says that secret negotiations are under way, but discussions are not secret just because he is not part of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The agenda of the Prime Minister and those with whom he is engaged in discussions—including the leader of the hon. Gentleman's party and other party leaders in Northern Ireland—is to bring about all the things that were envisaged in the Good Friday
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
agreement. It is about the achievement of decommissioning, of a normalised society in Northern Ireland and of the policing reforms that were part of the Good Friday agreement and are set out in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. The people of Northern Ireland voted for those things. We never said that progress would be easy; there were bound to be difficulties, but we have to have discussions—not secret negotiations—with all those who helped to bring about that agreement for the betterment of society in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Tony McWalter 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my right hon. Friend accept that many of us think that some easing of the security arrangements in South Armagh has been a good thing, given that there has been a tenfold decrease in the number of people on the republican side who are implacably—perhaps violently—opposed to the regime? Some de-escalation of security arrangements is vital to ensure that those in the area who are still of a violent inclination can no longer say, "Look, they've done nothing—you might as well join us."</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Any change in the security profile depends on the assessment of the Chief Constable acting with the advice of the General Officer Commanding. We take all that advice on board, along with that which we receive from our own security advisers. There are difficult decisions to make, but changes in the security profile in Northern Ireland have been welcomed both in and beyond the communities that have been mentioned. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the changes that have been delivered up to now have reduced the security forces' capability to bring people to justice and to thwart attacks mounted on them. Those matters are judged on the basis of the best security advice available.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

As I understand it, among other things, the sangar in Crossmaglen has been removed. Will he also agree that there is something wrong when we hear a security person saying that the towers that are to be removed face in a different direction? From my limited training as an Army cadet, I know that one does not look in only one direction, especially if one is guarding a fort of some description, so I should have thought that towers had to face all around. Finally, has the mountain climber ceased to operate in secret negotiations, or is he unaware of those?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall not comment on what the hon. Gentleman calls secret negotiations.

I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand why I shall not discuss the nature of the security profile in South Armagh or the functions and efficacy of

I can confirm that the Borucki sangar in Crossmaglen was demolished: that was done on the back of a clear assessment by the Chief Constable and a report by the General Officer Commanding that its demolition would not put at risk those who operate on the ground on behalf of the security forces in South Armagh. It would not have been taken down without that assurance of safety.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is a devolved matter for which the Minister for Social Development has ultimate responsibility. Therefore, I cannot comment on matters relating to its administration, resources or general policy. However, the Chief Constable is involved in the processing of certificates for persons seeking to move under the scheme, and he has informed me that 118 certificates were issued by him during the period 1 February 2000 to 31 January 2001 inclusive.

	<div class='title'>Human Rights and Equality in Northern Ireland</div> <!-- title -->
	<p>2.58 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. George Howarth)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to
move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of human rights and equality in Northern Ireland.</p></blockquote>
I thank the Committee for the opportunity to discuss human rights and equality in Northern Ireland. As the Committee knows, those issues were central to the Good Friday agreement. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 translated that into new structures for protecting rights and promoting equality among people in Northern Ireland, creating a new dispensation based on the protection of rights for all: a society where diversity is valued, not feared, and in
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0170">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
which those issues are central to policy making. At the core of those changes has been the creation of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Concerns about equality are not new to Northern Ireland. For many years, the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Fair Employment Commission safeguarded Northern Ireland's work force against gender and religious discrimination. More recently, separate commissions have dealt with race and disability issues. Each has played a crucial role in helping to shape a more equal and just society in Northern Ireland, and I am sure that they will continue to do so in their new, unified form under the energetic leadership of Joan Harbison.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Committee knows that Northern Ireland has a strong body of anti-discrimination legislation and that that is now the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Administration, so I will not discuss the matter further here. However, the Westminster Parliament retains responsibility for a crucial new statutory duty that requires public authorities to have regard for the need to promote equality of opportunity and good community relations in everything that they do. The Equality Commission is charged with oversight of that duty: one of its roles is to assess public authorities' equality schemes, in which they set out how they intend to meet their section 75 obligations across the full range of their functions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have made it clear that we want as broad a range of bodies as possible to be covered by the statutory duty. The vast majority of public authorities in Northern Ireland are already covered and we will soon introduce a designation order to extend the duty to a further tranche. It is crucial that equality should be firmly anchored in the everyday life of Northern Ireland. The statutory equality duty does not merely pay lip service to the ideals of equality of opportunity and good community relations: it requires us to consider fully the implications of what we do and continually to assess whether there are better ways of doing them. That is good.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Inevitably, changes in attitude toward equality—the idea of fixing something so that it does not break— have an impact on everyone. I particularly welcome the impetus that the statutory duty has given to the goal of strengthening links between different sections of the community by encouraging them to work together in meaningful partnerships to address inequalities and to build a stronger society in Northern Ireland. That dialogue between diverse sectors of society will promote better government by helping to develop better decision making and more fond more focused services. It should, therefore, be encouraged. I am confident that we will continue to build on the solid foundations that have been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is another significant creation that has arisen from the Good Friday agreement. The commission is unique in the United Kingdom. Since its inception two years ago, it has worked very well under the leadership of
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
Brice Dickson, establishing itself on both the domestic and international stages. The commission acts as a watchdog: it is charged with promoting human rights for everyone in Northern Ireland. Recently, the Human Rights Act 1998 has been introduced across the UK. It introduces into our domestic law the rights that were set out in the European convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms. The UK was instrumental in the formulation of those rights in the aftermath of the second world war. All Committee members, regardless of their party allegiance, aspire to the values that those rights represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Human Rights Act requires us to re-examine the way in which we do things and to identify scope for improvement, as does the statutory equality duty. That is a healthy process. I am sure that every Committee member wants to promote a society that is based on clear respect for the rights of every individual.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will additional funding be given to the Human Rights Commission to allow for a comprehensive consultation exercise on the Bill of Rights?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Human Rights Commission knows that if we are to justify any additional resources we need proper costings, based on an assessment of the work that needs to be funded but is not being funded. In those circumstances, we would happily consider any application, but I am not prepared to give an absolute commitment without knowing its possible scale or the justification for it. That is not to discourage the commission from applying—indeed, Brice Dickson is aware that we have said on several occasions that if we are given the figures and the justification, we will look at them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because the issues we are discussing were at the core of the Good Friday agreement, the agreement recommended that the new Human Rights Commission be charged with advising on the scope for defining additional rights, supplementary to those contained in the European convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to determine whether that is necessary in the context of the unique situation in Northern Ireland. As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Dr. Godman) pointed out, we have asked the commission to advise on this, and we expect to receive its advice towards the end of the year. To that end, it is embarking on a wide consultation exercise, seeking the views of people and communities throughout Northern Ireland. I urge everyone to take part in that consultation. The Commission's advice will be more meaningful and more relevant if it draws on the views, experience and expertise of all sectors of the community, and that can be achieved only if people contribute to the consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Rights are not the preserve of one group or another; they are for everybody. The creation of the two new commissions and the introduction of the statutory equality duty and the Human Rights Act are important first steps. The challenge is to ensure that these new building blocks achieve their objective and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0171">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
provide a better future for all the people in Northern Ireland. The key to that is working together: we need to develop partnerships that allow people to benefit from each other's involvement; everyone has something to contribute. Of course the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission might not always see eye to eye with the Government or, for that matter, the devolved Administration, but that is inevitable if they are to act as truly independent bodies. Independence should not stop us working together and it should not stop us sharing common goals.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister speaks about Government working together. The Government have a role to play. Last Thursday I sought a Ministerial statement, and the Leader of the House suggested that I might find an opportunity to question the Minister today, as we would be dealing with human rights and equal opportunities. The Minister of State referred to the return to prison under licence of Johnny Adair, yet look at what is happening in Northern Ireland, for example, the murder of Trevor Kells. It is known who committed that murder. He was a murderer released under licence and unless he happens to be the one who was named today, he has not yet been returned, although his compatriots, exercising their bestiality, shot him and his driver. It is known that that gentleman is responsible for the murder. Why has he not been returned under licence to prison on equality issues?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has used the opportunity presented to him to make that point. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State made it clear earlier that there was no unwillingness on his part, that of the Chief Constable, or that of the Secretary of State where appropriate, to revoke a licence if someone who had been released from prison under the prisoner release scheme breached the licence or committed a further offence while out on licence. However, in human rights or any other terms, it would be improper for a licence to be revoked unless there was clear evidence to support that. It would be improper for me to evaluate in Committee the effectiveness one way or another of any evidence in any case. I am sure that the Minister of State and the Chief Constable will consider the matter as a result of what the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) has said, but only on the basis of proper evidence on which they can act.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the revocation of a licence, will the Minister clarify whether it is necessary to have sufficient evidence— evidence that could be presented in court to secure a conviction—or it is sufficient to have such intelligence as the Chief Constable feels appropriate to identify the person? The Minister will appreciate that evidence that would substantiate a conviction and intelligence that would satisfy him that a breach of the licence had occurred are two clearly different things.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As a distinguished lawyer, the hon. and learned Gentleman will be aware that any case could be the subject of judicial review; that that was precisely the way in which the law acted in the Adair
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
case. It follows that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State and the Chief Constable will have to take any evidence into consideration in anticipation that it could become a matter of public knowledge. In every circumstance, whether there is intelligence or direct evidence before them, they will have to make difficult judgments. Those are difficult situations, and I am loth to be drawn into a lengthier debate, because we are dealing with tricky aspects of justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that a safe, just and tolerant society is important for all people in Northern Ireland. We still have some way to go before we can sit back and say that everything is all right, but in politics we should never allow complacency to set in. We have made a real start by putting in place appropriate structures to create such a society. Institutional change is certainly important in cementing a culture in which human rights and equality are respected.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Solihull)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I put this to the Minister in anything but a sarcastic way: would he not agree that, if there is a deficiency in human rights in Northern Ireland, it is certainly not because of a shortage of institutions?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I think that the hon. Gentleman's intervention was laced with a touch of sarcasm, although I do not know where it was directed. The situation in Northern Ireland was and is such that it is important to have properly resourced, properly led institutions that can ensure equality and human rights and act as an independent watchdog. At the end of the day, it is not a question of reassuring the Committee, the hon. Gentleman or myself. What is truly important is that no man and woman in Northern Ireland feels discriminated against in terms of employment, gender or anything else—in sum, that individual human rights are in no way removed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I often make the point that in years to come people in England, Scotland or Wales may look at what is happening in Northern Ireland in those two areas and say that we should perhaps adopt it as a model.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

There is indeed international interest in both the Northern Ireland institutions. Who would not want to ensure that equality and human rights are properly implemented, or that specific organisations in Northern Ireland are dedicated to that task?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does not the Minister accept that the people of Northern Ireland feel that they have been seriously discriminated against in that in no other part of the United Kingdom would someone who has been convicted of murdering 12 people be released after 18 months? Would that have happened to the late Reginald Kray, the Brixton bomber or Myra Hindley?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman has strong feelings about that and, quite properly, never misses the opportunity to put that point of view. The issue flows directly from the Good Friday agreement, which he and some of his hon. Friends do not accept. That agreement was a package and part of it involved a prisoner release scheme. I and those who support the agreement fervently hope that it will enable us to put violence, terrorism and the gangster culture that predominates in some areas behind us. The hon. and learned Gentleman is entitled to his opinion, but it is not appropriate to extend it to the context of the two institutions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister said, rightly, that it is important that all individuals in Northern Ireland have the same rights. I am sure that we agree about that. However, the Government's justification for not extending the Race Relations Act 1976 to Northern Ireland was that that the problem of racism and associated racial discrimination was not sufficiently serious there. Given that the number of racially motivated attacks or incidents went up from 26 in 1996 to 245 in 2000, does the Minister think that there is still not sufficient justification for extending that Act?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that all members of the Committee will agree that any racially motivated attack of any description is despicable and unacceptable. However, such attacks are out of character in Northern Ireland. There may be divisions in Northern Ireland—no one pretends otherwise—but such activity is alien and repugnant to the majority of right-thinking people there. On the specific point raised, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State is reviewing whether anti-hate legislation may be appropriate and, as always, he will take careful note of what the hon. Gentleman says.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am pleased with the progress that has been made. Change must come not only from the top down from institutions, but from the bottom up. It is not enough for politicians to talk about human rights and equality in a purely abstract sense, tempting though that may be and no matter how sincere we are about it. Without the commitment of the people of Northern Ireland to the programme of change, we will not achieve the goal that we all share of creating a long and lasting peace. It must never be forgotten that everyone in the community has a role to play. We politicians, irrespective of the tradition from which we come or our political party, have a duty to encourage people to engage in human rights and equality issues in a way that adds to whole, and does not take away from it. I am confident that despite the many setbacks—it is no good pretending that we do not have them—we can, and will, succeed in establishing a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. I hope that the Committee shares my optimism for the future. Even though we remain concerned about some developments, there is cause for optimism—albeit cautious optimism.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I agree with the Minister that human rights and equality of opportunity are rights that everyone must enjoy and that they must be secured for all the people of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Ulster Unionist party has, for some time, been a vigorous advocate of equality and human rights. Our last election manifesto clearly stated the belief in equality across the spectrum, from women's and children's issues to disability issues. At the general election, we expressly stated our desire for the European convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms to be incorporated into United Kingdom law to protect everyone's basic civil and political rights. Unfortunately, although we now have the Human Rights Act 1998, not all have sufficient protection of their basic civil and political rights. We may have a Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland and, after some foot-dragging, a Human Rights Commission in the Republic, but we also have a human rights community in Northern Ireland that has created a selective and highly politicised version of human rights that dispenses with the concept of equality.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My lack of faith in the Northern Ireland human rights community in general and in the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in particular is founded on three issues: first, the selective attitude to human rights abuses; secondly, the attitude to police recruitment; and, thirdly, the attitude to parades. If time permitted, I would be more than willing and able to elaborate on all those issues. As it does not, I shall elaborate on the selective attitude to human rights abuses with reference to the human rights community's obsession with human rights abuses orchestrated by the state.

All abuses of human rights are abhorrent. Speaking in 1995, a former chairman of the Committee on the Administration of Justice made that point when he said that
	<br><blockquote><p>"there are some aspects of the Committee on the Administration of Justice which I would have to say I am frankly disappointed with. Do they recognise that the greatest abuse of human rights in Northern Ireland in the last 25 years is that carried out by the paramilitary groups?"</p></blockquote>
The statistics available validate that assertion. The cost of the troubles survey tells us that of the 3,585 people were killed up to 3 December 2000, only, but none the less sadly, 11 per cent, were killed by the security forces; yet 58 per cent, were killed by republican paramilitaries and 28% by loyalist paramilitaries. Those facts are ignored by the human rights community in its approach to abuses of rights.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has set up a victims' rights project, in which it speaks of such as the right to information about the incidents of violence in question, the right to adequate compensation, the right to have someone held to account for the violence inflicted upon them, and the right to be treated equally to other victims of violence. However, in mid-October last year, the commission
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0173">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
acted, in my opinion, as puppets for the Real IRA by bringing an action to block the "Panorama" exposé of the Omagh bombers. It did so in ignorance of article 10 of the European convention on human rights, which deals with the right to freedom of expression, and in disregard of the right to information about violent incident in question, which one of the rights mentioned in the commission's own victims' rights project. The result of that legal action was that the commission lost the case, the programme was aired and the reality of the republican atrocity was held under the spotlight of investigative journalism and freedom of information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the 9 May 2000, the Commission joined with republican apologists such as British Irish Rights Watch to call for an inquiry into the murder of Patrick Finucane, because of the "range of issues" that the murder had thrown up. However, no range of issues or alleged collusion has caused the Commission concern about allegations of Garda collusion, but then Garda collusion is not part of the republican bandwagon, and the human rights community appears to consider victims of non-state abuses to be only second-class victims. Victims of paramilitaries are treated as second-class victims: as far as the human rights community is concerned, people who have received punishment without law, breaching article 7 of the convention, are second-class victims, unless that punishment involved the state.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Öpik</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to interrupt the hon. Gentleman's flow. The picture he paints is pretty grim, but does he accept that some of the work of the Committee on the Administration of Justice directly addressed the frictions that cause paramilitary activity. As such, the CAJ has tried to address the cause of the violations that he is describing. The CAJ would probably be very sympathetic to his view that ultimate human rights violation—the taking of somebody's life by paramilitary—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is important that the perception of the majority community of the way in which such bodies have operated to date is clearly on the record, so that there will be a more equal and more "human rights" approach to those matters in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who have been tortured in breach of article 3 of the convention are also second-class victims unless the state was involved. Those many members of the business community who go bust because of the abuses of extortion and racketeering are also second-class victims. The human rights community and the Human Rights Commission have a duty to those people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That duty is all the greater when seen in the light of the South African example. In South Africa, unlike in Northern Ireland, the amnesty for prisoners was conditional on co-operating with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and on creating accountability and transparency by highlighting all breaches of human rights, whether committed by the state or otherwise. There are, as Brice Dickson termed it, a "range of issues" surrounding the Kingsmills massacre and the events of Bloody Friday. Just as it may be necessary to scrutinise further the state's
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
involvement in Bloody Sunday, it may also be necessary to scrutinise the republican leadership's involvement in Bloody Friday and other such atrocities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The human rights community's attitude to the issue of police recruitment has been horrifying. The Ulster Unionist party clearly wants a police service that reflects the community that it polices, but our focus is and has been on the means of promoting and securing such a service. We do not and cannot justify discrimination in employment, so we cannot support the discriminatory method of recruitment introduced under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. However, the commission easily justified the policy; it
	<br><blockquote><p>"concluded that the kind of positive discrimination recommended by Patten was the only viable option at this time."</p></blockquote>
That discrimination was not deemed the only viable option to address the gender imbalance or the under-representation of other groups in society; other groups must do with affirmative action measures. Those familiar with the debate will realise that, as the Government do not want to corrupt the merit principle, only success in affirmative action will permit 50:50 discrimination to operate effectively; and if affirmative action were working, there would be no need for statutory discrimination. However, those rather obvious points were lost on the human rights community in Northern Ireland and the Human Rights Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In respect of parades, the human rights community has taken a perverse attitude to article 11 of the European convention on human rights, even though the Human Rights Commission frustrated the Secretary of State's desire to bring the Human Rights Act into force early in Northern Ireland. It was reported in 	<i>The Observer</i> on 3 September 2000 that the Human Rights Commission feared that an early introduction would:
	<br><blockquote><p>"bolster loyalist rights to campaign during the marching season."</p></blockquote>
Officially, Brice Dickson gave a different spin to the commission's objections, saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We felt it was premature because the police, the judges and the Parades Commission were not up to speed on the legislation when the Secretary of State wanted to introduce it."</p></blockquote>
Human rights are for everyone in society and the Human Rights Commission should represent all the victims of human rights abuses in Northern Ireland. The current self-appointed human rights community in Northern Ireland and the Human Rights Commission are not representing all victims of human rights abuses in Northern Ireland. In future, Northern Ireland spokespersons and guardians of human rights must return to the core principles of the European convention on human rights. Human rights must no longer be exploited by certain elements within our society for their own political or sectarian gain. The agenda of the human rights debate has to be refocused on the real victims of human rights abuse in Northern Ireland—the ordinary people, who are battered, shot, intimidated, extorted and terrorised on our streets every day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps the Ministers present today will ensure that the current Secretary of State is not trapped into visiting my community, where a selected audience of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0174">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
Roman Catholic and republican families who have been subjected to sectarian attack are given an opportunity to air their views, with no consideration given to nor any arrangement made to meet the many Protestant families who had been intimidated either by those perceived to be loyalists or republicans, even though their suffering was no less than that of the Roman Catholic families to whom the previous Secretary of State specifically gave attention. I hope that there will be an opportunity for the present Secretary of State to visit my constituency and get a full picture of the perceived Orange-on-Orange, Orange-on-green, green-on Orange and green-on-green violence and intimidation. The tragedies and suffering of the families in my constituency have not been as the media have portrayed them; it is not one-sided or simplistic. Those families should not be used by any one elected representative to gain cheap headlines. Their suffering is real.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the intervention to date by the Chief Constable, members of the armed forces and I trust that those who abuse the rights of others will be apprehended, prosecuted and given stiff sentences, to serve as a warning to others to think before they get involved in this kind of activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My brief speech will focus primarily on two or three questions that I have for the Minister. First, let me say to the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) that whatever he and his hon. Friends think about the Bloody Sunday tribunal, the setting up of such an inquiry stopped in its tracks a very valuable recruiting aid that had been employed by the recruiting officers of the IRA ever since that terrible day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am extremely interested in the work of both the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission, but I do have a couple of questions to ask..</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have gone out of my way to indicate that the concerns that there may have been abuse of human rights in respect of the victims of Bloody Sunday should have been no greater or less than that of the victims of Bloody Friday, or any of the other massacres that have taken place elsewhere. Surely, the hon. Gentleman recognises that the absence of public inquiries into the Kingsmills massacre and the many other massacres that have taken place on the Unionist side has not lent itself to recruitment to loyalist paramilitary organisations. The argument that the absence of a public inquiry into Bloody Sunday helped recruitment to the IRA is spurious.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chair</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Interventions should be interventions. That one was a bit long.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well understand the feelings of the hon. Member for East Antrim about those matters, but I do not think that my argument relating to the Bloody Sunday tribunal is spurious. I supported the setting up of that inquiry and I am on public record as
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
saying that I wanted a Scots judge to chair the tribunal. The one I mentioned on a number of occasions was Lord Cullen, who carried out the Dunblane and Piper Alpha inquiries. I agree with the hon. Gentleman on one point: the concern for the victims of violence felt by him and his hon. Friends is shared by Labour Members. We do not live in Northern Ireland and although our visits to Northern Ireland might be frequent, we remain visitors, but we fully understand the concern felt by Northern Ireland Members when their constituents are badly beaten or worse by murderous thugs. Their constituents have always had our deep sympathy. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman would even think of challenging that sentiment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps if it had been a Scots judge, expenditure on the Bloody Sunday inquiry would have been a bit more frugal.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Shona McIsaac 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Cleethorpes)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We are talking about equality.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am an Ulster Scot. Is the hon. Gentleman aware that expenditure to date on that inquiry is in excess of £33 million? Does he understand the sense of injustice in the Unionist community when we see such a sum spent on one particular incident, yet nothing spent on many other incidents, massacres and atrocities affecting our community?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that because I am an Edinburgh Scot I am a wee bit careful with my money. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I well remember you from Edinburgh, Mr. McWilliam, and I would not dare to cross you. The hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) makes a serious point. I have a copy of his question— I believe that it was No. 5 on the Order Paper and that the answer was £33,800,000 or something. Of course that is a large sum and the tribunal has a long way to run, but I do not believe that one can put a price on the search for truth and justice. The hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that he is an Ulster Scot. I do not recall questions of cost arising at any time in connection with the Dunblane massacre inquiry, or the terrible Piper Alpha affair, which in my view should have led to company directors being put in the dock for culpable homicide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission will play a central role in the peace process. Serious concern has been voiced to me that the Human Rights Commission is underfunded, and I have no doubt that the eminent Mrs. Harbison and her colleagues will say the same about their work in their commission. I thank the Minister for his sympathetic response to my question about funding for the consultation on the Bill of Rights. I think that he said that no application had been made; naturally, I hope that such an application will be made. I agree that it has to be comprehensive and financially watertight; otherwise that fellow from Dunfermline may have something to say. The consultation needs to both inclusive and comprehensive, and that is what prompted my question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0175">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
I believe that I am right in saying that the Northern Ireland Act 1998 calls for a review of the power of the Human Rights Commission within a period of two years. If I am right about that—I attended much of the debate on the Northern Ireland Bill, but I am sure that I will be corrected if I steer a negligent course—but who is to carry out the review, and will it be independent of the Northern Ireland Office? During consideration of the Act I said that the powers of the Human Rights Commission appeared to be inadequate. My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) who is on Council of Europe duty today, was one of those who was very keen to see such a review written into legislation. Will the review analyse the commission's powers in comparison with the United Nations principles, known colloquially as the Paris principles?.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Another question relates to the relationship between the commission and the proposed—I should say embryonic—Human Rights Commission in the Irish Republic. Colin Harvey, in the current edition of "Fortnight", has this to say:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Belfast Agreement envisaged Northern and Southern Human Rights Commissions with the aim of improving human rights protection for everyone on this island. There has been a remarkable silence about the all-Ireland dimension to human rights protection which may, or may not, be remedied once the Irish Commission is fully operational. The establishment of this Commission has been severely delayed"—</p></blockquote>
he is talking about the Irish one—
	<br><blockquote><p>"and it has much catching up to do."</p></blockquote>
The Committee might be interested to learn that Colin Harvey is professor of constitutional and human rights law at the university of Leeds. Will the day come when the two commissions will be given the opportunity to work together to create an all island of Ireland view of human rights protection? It seems to me that if they need to work together they should have similar powers, and that is a matter for the two Governments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are those in Scotland who would like to see a Scottish human rights commission. Some say it should be set up in Edinburgh, others in Glasgow; I would offer Greenock, but the Minister would expect me to say that. My hon. Friend was dead right to mention Scotland: there is keen interest among Scots lawyers and those interested in human rights in the creation of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. My hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Mr. Browne) has tabled questions to the Secretary of State for Scotland about the creation of such a commission in Scotland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hurrying along to the subject of the Equality Commission, I always believed that it made good sense to bring together within one body the functions carried out by a number of commissions, including the disability council. Bringing those—the equality commissioners may take umbrage at this—disparate functions together with a staff of about 120 must have been difficult. There are bound to be teething problems, but I have every confidence in Mrs. Harbison and Evelyn Collins and the others engaged in the commission's work. These are early days.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
I do not want to overload the Minister, but I have a few questions for him. Is he satisfied with the commission's funding? He is almost bound to say yes, but I would like him to consider it again. I refer in particular to section 75 duties. In addition, which organisations have been designated and which others are being considered for designation? Is he satisfied with the equality schemes? Despite these being early days, what benefits have already accrued? The commission was set up on 1 October 1999 and is in its 16th or 17th month of operation—I am lousy at arithmetic—and it would be handy if the Minister said something about the equality schemes. Last but not least, will he say when there will be submissions on the new policing arrangements for section 75 duties? Am I right in thinking that that is in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000? To conclude, I genuinely believe that both commissions will play an important role in the peace process, but they need to be adequately resourced.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I am conscious, in a patriotic way that is now somewhat out of fashion, that the principles of human rights, of justice and of liberty are more keenly defended and advocated within the United Kingdom than in any other part of Europe.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is a matter of personal and professional pride that during the period in which I practised at the Bar, I was retained by members of the nationalist community and its elected representatives, the Catholic Church, Catholic solicitors and individual Catholic clients. I can claim to know a little about the protection of human rights in Northern Ireland. Members of the community whose political views I did not share respected my balance and fairness. They put their faith in me as a fair person to represent their interests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Against that background, I move on to speak about the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland. For any institution, or commission, to propagate the views that it was brought into being to promote, it must have the support of the entire community. One of the disadvantages of the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland is the widespread view, which I share, that it is unbalanced, unrepresentative and has not devoted itself to the human rights of the entire community. Since it was instituted, and in its entire 	<i>modus operandi,</i> it has done nothing to obtain the support of the majority community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other speakers have touched on some important matters, so I shall mention them only briefly. The Human Rights Commission has operated on the basis of making a distinction between human rights and human rights that are infringed or impinged upon by the state or its servants. What about the human rights that are violated and trampled daily by paramilitary organisations of all hues?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I view with the same degree of abhorrence and detestation Orange, green, nationalist and Unionist paramilitary organisations. They are a plague on our entire society. None has any moral or political superiority over any other. Yet the Chief Commissioner for Human Rights, Professor Brice Dickson, has said that the commission is not ostensibly concerned with such breaches of human rights. It always struck me as odd that the right to equality in employment, the right to free speech and even the right to silence should be given pre-eminence over the most fundamental right of all—the right to life.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mrs. Louise Ellman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Liverpool, Riverside)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman accept that the Human Rights Commission is only one among a range of instruments to bring about a new beginning? It is not intended to supersede the actions of Governments or
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
intergovernmental institutions. Are not issues relating to employment, religion and race highly relevant to creating a new more inclusive society?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As the American declaration of independence says, such truths are self-evident. I do not quarrel with them, but that is not my point. The protection of human rights by the Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland must be acceptable to the entire community, but it is not. That is not just my view, or the view of Unionist politicians and their supporters, it is the view of many academics. Recently, an independent academic heavily criticised the Human Rights Commission for its failure to address the activities of paramilitaries.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Earlier, in an intervention on the Minister, I raised points about discrimination, about unfairness, about human rights. What about the human rights of the mother or father of Lance Bombadier Restorick, serving in Northern Ireland, coolly and deliberately murdered by a sniper—Mr. Caraher, who had killed 11 others by exactly the same method? We have the application of the principles of law and justice. He was tried and, on incontrovertible evidence, was convicted, sentenced to five or six life sentences for murder and to hundreds of years in prison for other sentences. He was released after 18 months. When he was being sentenced, he laughed in the court because he knew that he would be released. What about the alleged loyalist who picked up a 16-year-old Catholic teenager, James Morgan, beat him to death with a hammer, tossed him into a pit where diseased animals were disposed; who was apprehended, convicted and released after 18 months because of some claim that he was associated with some loyalist paramilitary organisation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is discrimination of the most fundamental kind. It is an abandonment of the fundamental principles of democracy. It is a violation of the rule of law. It laughs in the face of the administration of justice but it is justified as a risk for peace. Do the means always justify the end? If we are to have a system of human rights in Northern Ireland, it must be dedicated to human rights in an absolute sense. It must not be prostituted to the objectives of political expediency. It must not be selective. It must be like justice, blind to the description, to the religion or to the political allegiances of those to whom it is addressed, and that is not the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What would be the outcry in the UK if the Soho bomber, sentenced to I do not know how many terms, was released? But we know that he will never get out. What about Myra Hindley? What about the Krays? We see running about all over Northern Ireland dozens of serial, convicted murderers who have been released, but we hear nothing about the human rights of the victims. They are doubly victims. They are also victims of a policy of political expediency that sees human rights only when it serves their political objective but does not see truly human rights when they should be applied to every citizen of the UK.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of this is justified, as the Minister attempted to justify it, with the argument that it is part of a package, of some overall worthy end, and that, in some way,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0177">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
those who are denied their human rights, those who suffer can say, "We are only an individual or a collection of individuals. We suffer because there is some greater end that would benefit many more."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That is the philosophy of every totalitarian dictator. It was the philosophy of Stalin and Hitler that the individual did not matter, that there was a great goal, whether it was the great leap forward, the five-year plan or the extermination of the Jews. There was a package and the package was for the greater good of the people who in time would come to realise this, except those who had been despatched, those who had been maimed, those who had been mutilated and those who had been murdered. If that is the policy of the present Government or any British Government, it is anathema to those who believe in democracy or the rule of law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are told in Northern Ireland that there is no alternative to this process. We are asked what our alternative is, but the full question is never asked. It is: what is our alternative to a process of appeasement of terrorism, breach of the fundamental principles of democracy and abandonment of the rule of law? There must be an alternative. That alternative lies in the application of the principles of democracy, adherence to the rule of law and the enforcement of human rights, for all purposes, not just for political purposes.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I come from a different political perspective from that of the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney). However, I recognise that some of what he said may need a response. Human rights and the move towards equality are not fresh issues for Northern Ireland that have to be imported from outside in order to get things right for the people of Northern Ireland. They are not incapable of understanding those issues, or of moving in those directions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When the Labour party changed from the Labour representation committee, it held its first annual conference in 1906 in Belfast, although people from Northern Ireland are no longer allowed to be members of the Labour party. The choice of location reflected the fact that there were forces and movements throughout the United Kingdom that believed in the values of democratic socialism and the ideas that were being propounded at that time. That was reflected as much in the working class areas of Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland as it was in the areas of this country, such as Bradford, from which the Labour party had emerged, and where the old independent Labour party, which was part of that Labour structure, had been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We need to remember that there have long been human rights problems in Northern Ireland. The nationalist felt that the Unionist community was dominant in the old Stormont. They felt out of it, and that the rules were often used against them. However, while events occurred that led to the civil rights movement some 30 years ago, it is important to be remember also that some fantastic changes occurred in
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
that time as well. Northern Ireland is deep into history, and goes way back. Sometimes, it is perhaps unfortunate that we even go 30 years back. Old television films are dug out, showing RUC members and B Specials beating up in crowds in Derry and other places. That is treated as if it is taking place now and as though it were just the common arrangement that existed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been some incredible changes, and those changes have not been entirely divorced from the people of Northern Ireland. There has been direct rule from the United Kingdom Parliament, which Northern Ireland Members have shared in. However, there have been changes. One of the great disputes of the civil rights movement was electoral injustice and gerrymandering. That is behind us.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is left of electoral problems in Northern Ireland is electoral fraud, a matter that the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs has taken up and pressed with the Government. The Committee is concerned that there have not been faster moves to deal with those problems. The constant difficulty with Northern Ireland is that, where there is great conflict, people will use the avenues available to them— whether through the paramilitaries, the communities or state institutions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Democracy is built on more than just votes. There have to be various attitudes, which it might be difficult to develop in Northern Ireland across the board. There have been many other important economic and social developments. The Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts 1976 and 1989 have made improvements, not only with regard to Roman Catholic under-representation in solidly Protestant areas, but also where Protestants are under-represented in Roman Catholic areas. The bodies set up to tackle that problem have made considerable advances. When the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee investigated the matter, before we produced our report, the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) was a member of our Committee. He recognised that the employment legislation had helped to produce significant changes in Northern Ireland. He admitted that he would not have imagined that before he became involved in our investigations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When hon. Members from Britain go across to Northern Ireland, they are often envious of the housing developments that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has set up. Because a central executive co-ordinated those developments, it could take on board ideas that came from all sorts of political groups. The houses were not built exclusively for one community. That has improved matters considerably. Although we now have the Assembly and the Executive and the big new hope under the peace agreement, this is not the first effort. This is a power-sharing arrangement, however people want to talk about it. Power sharing was tried by different forces that sought to reconcile and come together. They include people like Paddy Devlin and others for whom I have a great deal of time.

It is sometimes forgotten that there is an interest in Northern Ireland in developing various civil liberties and rights. My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde mentioned disability. Civil rights for disabled people is an issue across the whole of Northern Ireland. There are many disability groups reflecting the concerns of all the political parties. In 1994–95, I promoted the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) Bill. I was not the first to do so, but I was lucky in the ballot and I ran with it. I made sure that I got as wide as support as I could for the Bill. My sponsors included the hon. Members for Newry and Armagh (Mr. Mallon), for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) and for Belfast, South and the late Sir James Kilfedder. They were representatives of all the four Northern Ireland political parties in the House.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the same time, because of pressures from my Bill, the Conservative Government introduced the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. They published a White Paper in the morning and debated the Bill in the afternoon. Northern Ireland was not included in that Bill. However, when he introduced it, the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague), who was then a Minister at the Department of Social Security, said that there would be a change and it would apply to Northern Ireland. The fact that four Northern Ireland Members had sponsored my Bill showed that there was strong feeling in Northern Ireland and powerful representations.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman was right about the powerful representations. The problem with the Government Bill was that civil servants in Northern Ireland opposed its extension to Northern Ireland and, in fairness, I should say that, when I drew that to attention of the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks he quickly changed it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was helpful that support came from all parts of the House. I remember the hon. Member for North Antrim producing his own private Member's Bill, which was much lower down the list. It was called the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) (Northern Ireland) Bill. It was identical to my Bill, apart from the fact that "Northern Ireland" kept appearing. He managed to get called with a minute to go before 2.30 on a Friday, and had the wit to get up, move it and sit down. The Government nearly missed it and he nearly got Second Reading through without a debate, because there were enough people around to vote for it. Just as the Speaker was about to put the Question, one Conservative Back Bencher, who realised what the game was, got up and said a couple of words before the time ended.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often found with Northern Ireland issues that, right across the board, there are common concerns about economic and social issues. I remember us having a debate in a Room such as this over the question of Northern Ireland electricity privatisation, and a combined force of the Northern Ireland Members of Parliament with the Labour and
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
Liberal Democrat opposition overturned the Government, although they turned it around on the Floor of the House with a vote.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The people of Northern Ireland are grateful for the efforts of people such as hon. Gentleman for crystallising, and focusing on, the many points that members of all parties in Northern Ireland have in common, rather than on those that separate them.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Barnes</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Another indication of what was held in common was when I ran the Civil Rights (Disabled Persons) (Northern Ireland) Bill. I wrote to every political party in Northern Ireland seeking its support. I already had the support of the four that were in the House. I received letters of support from them all, even quite small parties, with the exception of two: the Conservative party in Northern Ireland, which was obviously not for my Bill but was in favour of the Disability Discrimination Bill; and Sinn Fein— presumably on the grounds that there was some embarrassment in supporting disability legislation when Sinn Fein's paramilitary wing was involved in creating so much disability on its own.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Belfast agreement has extended the human rights agenda. It is to be defended despite some of the problems that the hon. and learned Member for North Down has put forward. The Unionists have an agreement that states that, constitutionally, Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom unless some alternative decision is made by the people of Northern Ireland. Furthermore, that decision would have to be made by referendum, not just by the people of Northern Ireland with a majority in each community, but by the people of the Republic of Ireland who would have to agree to the removal of articles 2 and 3 of their constitution. Both sides can claim that parts of the agreement have some significance in connection with themselves, their interests and their concerns. That is an advance, an assurance that the Unionist communities did not have.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the wider Equality Commission. The only thing that concerned me about that, given my interest in disability legislation, was that the disability issue might get pushed on to the back burner and that an overriding commission might not be able fully to pick up its role. I am not sure what has occurred, and I may need some further feedback of the disability issues. However, the commission was part of the agreement and I accept it on those grounds, just as I accept the arguments about attempting to change the personnel, gender balance and community background of RUC officers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been an attempt to create an artificial centre in Northern Ireland politics. As the divisions were of border and constitution, it seemed that that was the right effort in which to engage. I suppose that it is like a third way, between the two other positions. I am not a great third way advocate. When the third way is about economic and social matters, I detach myself from it entirely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0179">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
Perhaps it was appropriate that one Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was my right hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), because he had a great deal to do with shaping the third way approach. I have always felt that the third way could be a way forward on constitutional and border matters. The attempt to create that centre to trade off between the two sides seemed entirely justified in Northern Ireland circumstances. We want Northern Ireland to develop economic and social agendas and to act on its own behalf.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland Members who entered the House faced the problem of being out-groups in relation to the rest of the United Kingdom. They have often been radical in pressing for extra resources and provisions, because they have not been part of any Executive or Assembly and have not been responsible for the decisions that have been taken. That has now changed, and there will be a tremendous impact on Northern Ireland politics in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the development works, it will be somewhat like developments that have taken place in the Republic, whose main parties have emerged from the dispute over the treaty and are no longer pro or anti-treaty. Mary Robinson said that they must get past the faded flags of the civil war. We must also get past some of the faded symbols that exist in Northern Ireland, important as they are to some people, who cannot move without concessions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the different groupings associated with different political parties will in time reflect more of a distinction on economic and social matters. They have often been united in their sense of being out of things. Now that there is shared power, politicians will have to make up their minds on economic and social matters, where the real and important political divisions lie. The third way of politics might find its way into all that, but I would not be on its side. I hope that there will be some scope for democratic socialism in those circumstances.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The human rights agenda is a significant matter and arises out of the past. The Belfast agreement has added a tremendous hope for the future. However, I accept the question asked by many hon. Members about what some community groups and human rights bodies are doing about the intimidation, beatings, exiles and all other horrors that exist. We have the equivalent of truth commissions and the inquiry into Bloody Sunday, and I accept that at some stage the whole past must be faced as people begin to talk about it. The forces of human rights and democracy will enable each group to have its say, but one group must not dominate another because it has a temporary majority. Democratic politics is about having the vote, human rights and a sense of an Opposition who might be tomorrow's Government and who are not squashed into the ground.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are high hopes in Northern Ireland. The arguments of no-voters sometimes have some resonance. They do not accept the constitutional development. The hon. and learned Member for North Down spoke excellently about abuses and killings, which society has not fully faced and for
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
which people have virtually been let off. Those are matters of serious concern. Serious human rights concerns are exhibited within them. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman and other hon. Members will look in another direction and use their arguments to help rebuild Northern Ireland; Northern Ireland could emerge from the situation as a beacon for the rest of the United Kingdom.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

It is appropriate that as we discuss human rights and equality in Northern Ireland we reconsider the issue of the Parades Commission and the rights of those who seek to march and process the public highway in Northern Ireland. When the legislation creating that commission passed through the House, those of us who were opposed to it argued that many of its provisions were contrary to human rights legislation. It is timely that we should reconsider the situation now that the Human Rights Act 1998 has come into operation and in the light of the recent House of Lords decision endorsing our view that we have the right publicly to process the public highway. In that decision, Lord Irvine of Lairg said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"I conclude therefore the law to be that the public highway is a public place which the public may enjoy for any reasonable purpose, provided the activity in question does not amount to a public or private nuisance and does not obstruct the highway by unreasonably impeding the primary right of the public to pass and repass: within these qualifications there is a public right of peaceful assembly on the highway. Since the law confers this public right, I deprecate any attempt to artificially restrict its scope."</p></blockquote>
That is the law of the country, clearly summarised in a decision by a Law Lord. It states that the law is entirely in compliance with human rights legislation. We can contrast that with the views taken by the Parades Commission in its two recent determinations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have always argued that the loyal institutions have the right peacefully to process the public highway and that any unreasonable restriction is contrary to human rights. Since the Human Rights Act came into operation, the Parades Commission has had to address that issue and has sought in its determinations—I believe unsatisfactorily—to review the position. We have heard much talk about competing rights, even though a right is more than a liberty and a toleration and is something that should not easily be set aside. We constantly ask to be told the right that competes with the right peacefully to process the public highway, but have never been given an adequate answer. However, the chairman of the Parades Commission has now said that he thinks that the alternative right is the right under article 8 to respect for private and family life. That cannot be reasonably argued; it is more of an excuse than a reason. If one studies the various cases associated with the right to respect for private and public family life, one sees that that has absolutely nothing to do with a competing right of freedom to march. Article 8 has to do with the right of children—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0180">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I have just noticed that hon. Member for Solihull (Mr. Taylor) is using a device specifically banned by the Speaker. The matter is currently under consideration, but we have not yet reached a conclusion. </div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John M. Taylor</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In the meantime, Mr. McWilliam, I apologise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Article 8 deals with the rights of children, rights relating to divorce, immigration, sexuality, personal mail surveillance, investigation, the search and seizure of property and prisoners; there is nothing about the competing right to march the public highway. The commission's argument is untenable and cannot hold sway.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chairman of the Parades Commission has stated that it will take decisions on the basis of political rather than security or public order principles. He said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission holds to the view that, in the long run, disputes over contentious parades will only be resolved by some form of dialogue between the parties concerned… Nevertheless, we are keen to reinforce the position of those in the loyal orders and the wider Unionist community who are arguing for dialogue between marchers and residents and we continue to believe that it is right to give due weight to efforts by parade organisers to address and accommodate the legitimate concerns of local residents."</p></blockquote>
Those are clearly political considerations. In other words, the Parades Commission has set out its political view and people will have to conform to it. That is a mistaken view of rights because there should be no obligation to observe a right in a certain way simply because someone believes that it should be observed in that way. That is contrary to the ethos of a human right.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Furthermore, we are told that if there is violence or the threat of violence from a third party, a parade must be stopped. That is contrary to natural justice. The courts have held that where there is a threat to public order, the police should take action against those who are making the threat, not against those who are seeking to uphold and observe the law. The Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 specifies certain obligations that the Parades Commission must take into consideration. Section 8(6)(a) refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"any public disorder or damage to property which may result from the procession",</p></blockquote>
but the Parades Commission interprets that far too broadly. The public disorder or damage to property it takes into account should be that which results from the procession—in other words, participants in the procession. It is perverse to stop a parade because of a threat from a third person or party.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the views of the Parades Commission and it is time that the Government re-examined the circumstances, reviewed the legislation and ensured that the proper rights of those who march are respected in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Margaret Moran 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Our debate has, rightly, focused primarily on human rights issues, but I shall speak briefly about the Equality Commission. It is important that we pay tribute to the
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
work of the many women, especially those on the front line of the difficulties in Northern Ireland, who have worked, often behind the scenes, but ceaselessly to ensure that equality issues are addressed. I pay particular tribute to the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, which has worked in a more political sphere to achieve the creation of the Equality Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no doubt that the Equality Commission will be an exemplar of the kind of equality legislation and institutions that we should have here in the United Kingdom. Indeed, we shall look with great envy at some of the proposals made for the Equality Commission and its work. I hope that, as Ministers and the Northern Ireland Assembly monitor the work of the Equality Commission, they will note not only its impact in the context of the Northern Ireland community, which I am sure will be extensive, but its potential impact here in the UK. I am sure that we can learn as its work progresses. We must warmly welcome not only the commission, but the many innovative ideas contained within its remit. A specific budget of £6.7 million has been set aside for its work. It is required to bring equality issues into the mainstream of policies and legislation in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the community—something that we in the United Kingdom have not achieved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The commission is also required to draw up equality impact assessments—a feature that would be welcome throughout our own policy, legislative and budget processes. There is a requirement for widespread consultation among all the organisations—voluntary and statutory—in Northern Ireland. That is real progress and something from which we could learn. The possibility of the single equality Bill—perhaps in 2002—emphasises the importance of ensuring coherence in Northern Ireland equality legislation and raises questions about the way in which our legislation operates and whether there are gaps in UK legislation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are many things that we should welcome, but just as many issues that we should address. We know that race equality legislation came into force in Northern Ireland only in 1997, 21 years later than in Great Britain. Research by the university of Ulster has produced alarming evidence of racial intolerance increasing in Northern Ireland. That must be addressed very rapidly. We know also that there has been consistently higher unemployment among Roman Catholics, especially men, and that women are seriously under-represented in public life compared with Great Britain. Only 14 per cent, of Members of the Legislative Assembly in Northern Ireland are women, compared with 40 per cent, in the National Assembly for Wales. Matters such as child care provision must be addressed if there is to be better representation in Northern Ireland of women in positions of authority in public and political life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Mr. Barnes) has mentioned, disability issues urgently need to be addressed as part of work of the Equality Commission. There is a higher percentage of the population with a disability in Northern Ireland than there is in Great Britain: recent figures show 17.4 per cent, of people with a disability, compared with
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0181">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
14.2 per cent. in Great Britain. Of course, much of that is attributable to the troubles; it is estimated that 40,000 people have a disability as a direct result of the troubles. The Equality Commission faces a huge amount of work
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have some concerns, which I would like the Minister to address, about the extent of the budget that has been made available to the Equality Commission and whether it is able effectively to carry out its duties under section 75 to promote equality of opportunity. Is the funding for compliance adequate for the Equality Commission and all of the organisations that are also required to comply with section 75? Could the Minister say which bodies have been designated by the Secretary of State and which bodies are currently being considered for designation? Will the Director of Public Prosecutions be designated and when will the provisions to submit new policing arrangements in respect of the section 75 duty, as introduced in the Police Act 2000, come into force? What specific changes have resulted from the equality schemes? When discussing the work of the Equality Commission, it is important to be specific about advances that are being made and that that we anticipate will be made. In what respects have service delivery and policy already been affected by the statutory duty to promote equality of opportunity?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great deal of work is needed in two further respects: one has already been mentioned in the context of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. We need to ensure that people in Northern Ireland are in no way disadvantaged by devolution and it is therefore essential that we introduce race relations legislation in Northern Ireland without delay. In the context of increasing incidents of racial intolerance, there is no justification for not introducing that Act as swiftly as possible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, those involved in the Equality Commission should give close consideration to the issue of domestic violence. It has received some attention, and I commend the work of the Northern Ireland women's aid organisation in tackling domestic violence and providing advice and support to survivors of domestic violence, but that work suffers from the problem that there are very few statistics on the incidence of domestic violence and no official recording across the various agencies to whom survivors go for help, which makes it difficult to be aware of the extent of domestic violence. The ground-breaking work that the Equality Commission is undertaking provides an opportunity to require that statistics be collected on a regular basis, so that we can have evidence of the incidence of domestic violence and thereby tackle it more effectively than we have in the past.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland has a new opportunity to lead the way, and it would be a missed opportunity if that issue were not addressed. There is an opportunity for the Equality Commission to set minimum standards of service for the survivors of domestic violence who seek help from a range of statutory and voluntary organisations. There is currently no minimum
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
standard across organisations, so we have a groundbreaking opportunity. In Northern Ireland, we can make major inroads into the terrible plight of those who are survivors of domestic violence. I want everyone who is involved in the Equality Commission to take the opportunity to show the rest of Great Britain that Northern Ireland will lead in equality issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

I listened very closely to the hon. and learned Member for North Down who spoke about the doctrine of the diminution of the consideration of the individual in the face of the greater scheme. He warned us against the superficial attractions of that doctrine. I found his remarks rather disturbing and I shall reflect upon them. I shall take no further time.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief, as I know the Minister will want to respond to the debate. I endorse some of the things that have been said by my hon. Friends, including my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim, about the membership of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. That has been a cause of concern to Unionists. I am especially concerned about the significant overlap between the membership of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, and the Committee on the Administration of Justice.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At the time that the Human Rights Commission was established, six out of 10 commissioners were also members of the CAJ. Recently one of those members, Angela Hegarty, resigned, so that at present five commissioners out of nine are also members of the CAJ. There is concern in the Unionist community that the CAJ has an undue influence on the workings of the Human Rights Commission. This is in spite of the fact that the Commission on page 12 of its strategic plan said that it is:
	<br><blockquote><p>"completely independent from any outside influence, be it the Government… a non governmental human rights organisation, or a group of activists."</p></blockquote>
Anyone looking at the composition of the commission and seeing that a majority, including the chief commissioner, of its members belong to the CAJ would conclude that there is an undue influence from an outside body.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also an imbalance in terms of the membership reflecting the wider community. Strand 1 of the Belfast agreement provided for the establishment of
	<br><blockquote><p>"A new Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, with membership from Northern Ireland reflecting the community balance."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0182">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
There is no way one can argue that the current composition of the Human Rights Commission reflects community balance; it certainly does not. That is an issue that the Government must address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The actions of the Human Rights Commission since its establishment have led to a perception in the Unionist community that it is biased in favour of the nationalist community: examples include the commission's support for the legalisation of religious discrimination in terms of the recruitment of police officers—as my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim correctly pointed out—which is contained in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. This will discriminate against the Protestant community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an attempt by the Human Rights Commission to intervene in a High Court case involving an application for judicial review by Evelyn White, a resident of the Garvaghy road area of Portadown who sought through judicial review to challenge the validity of the appointment of the members of the Parades Commission for Northern Ireland by the Secretary of State, and to seek a declaration that their appointment was unlawful. Thankfully, Lord Chief Justice Carswell ruled that he would not permit the intervention of the Human Rights Commission in the case. He added that there was no right for the Human Rights Commission to intervene in every and any case, and that it was for the judge in each case to determine whether an intervention by the Human Rights Commission was appropriate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome that ruling, because I feel the Human Rights Commission has stepped far beyond its remit and its role. Its intervention on the side of the residents of the Garvaghy road, seen alongside what my hon. Friend the Member for West Tyrone (Mr. Thompson) said about the shortcomings of both the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Commission in respect of parades, adds to the perception in the Unionist community that there is a bias on the part of the Human Rights Commission. There are other indications of bias on which I shall not elaborate. The Minister should examine the operation of the Human Rights Commission and the composition of its membership. Those matters will have to be reviewed if the Unionist community is to have confidence in the operation of this commission. There is no point in having the commission if it is not respected across the community, but the Unionist community has serious misgivings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am concerned about the Equality Commission's approach to and support for discriminatory action in the recruitment of police officers. That support and the commission's intervention on the flags issue have caused concern within the Unionist community about its impartiality. The chief commissioner, Joan Harbison, in her evidence to the Assembly Committee dealing with the matter, said:
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Commission has also advised that it is unacceptable for the Union flag to be flown specifically during the July and August period. There are many work places where such displays are no longer found. This is the position preferred by the Equality Commission."</p></blockquote>
In the perception of the Unionist community, the Equality Commission is intervening on one side against the interests of the other. I hope the Minister will urge the Equality Commission to take an even-handed approach with such sensitive issues.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. George Howarth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have had a very wide-ranging debate. At the beginning, I thought it would be more narrowly focused than it turned out to be; none the less, it has been interesting and useful. I apologise in advance, as I doubt that I shall be able to respond to all the points that have been raised in the time available to me. However, I shall of course observe the normal courtesies and write to hon. Members answering any questions or points that I am not able to address in Committee.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has been a great deal of debate about the independence of the Human Rights Commission, and criticism has been levelled at the Equality Commission. I will begin with the Human Rights Commission. The commission is an independent body. It was set up to act as an independent scrutineer the activities of Government and others to protect human rights. It is not a case of my approving or disapproving of any action it takes; it is up to the commission itself to fulfil its duties. I know that the commission is genuinely anxious to address the concerns of all sectors of the community. I agree with the hon. Member for Lagan Valley that everyone should feel that their rights are being properly protected. It is not a question of one side or the other. I do not believe that the Commission is biased. I believe that its members as a group are broadly representative of the community in Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State is very conscious of the obligations placed on him by in section 68 (3) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. He is always open to any arguments about balance— although I do not accept that there is an imbalance— and he is anxious to make sure that that is maintained.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The basis of the hon. Member for East Antrim's argument was that some of the worst abuses of human rights in Northern Ireland have been perpetrated by paramilitaries on both sides. I cannot comment on the specifics of any action by the Human Rights Commission; as I said, it is independent. However, what he says is manifestly true: some appalling breaches of individual human rights have been carried out by those organisations and, unfortunately, they carry on to this day. The European convention on human rights is framed in terms of protecting the individual against abuses of power by the state, and that is largely the legislative framework within which the commission operates. We want everyone in the community to benefit from human rights. We work tirelessly, as does the Human Rights Commission, to ensure that that is the case.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0183">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
The hon. Member for East Antrim also mentioned the Equality Commission's position on 50:50 recruitment, as did the hon. Member for Lagan Valley. The commission highlighted, not unreasonably, that the proportion of Catholics in the police had increased by a little more than 1 per cent., from 7.3 per cent, to 8.4 per cent., during the past 10 years, in spite of the fact that the proportion of Catholics in the population has increased. Furthermore, various affirmative action measures have been implemented by the RUC. Therefore, if we rely entirely on affirmative action alone, the pattern will continue. The hon. Member for Lagan Valley must recognise that we are not in the business of allowing that to become a permanent feature. In that sense, the Equality Commission was right to point out the difficulties of simply relying on affirmative action.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Antrim and other members of the Committee referred to the Savile inquiry into Bloody Sunday. A specific inquiry was set up to look into that event because it was alleged that the state's own authorities were involved and the Government have to be sure that they get at the truth. As has been said, rightly, we as a country pride ourselves on our democracy and respect for the law and on the professionalism and dedication of our security forces. I hope that the Savile inquiry achieves what it was set up to do and gets at the truth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde referred to funding, specifically for the Human Rights Commission. Its annual budget for the first three years is £750,000. At the time the budget was set, we believed that it was adequate for the commission's functions, but we have always made it clear that we would be willing to consider additional funding provided that such a request was supported by a properly costed business case. We are currently considering a bid from the commission that we received before Christmas and I hope that we shall make a decision soon. My hon. Friend also asked why the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has such limited powers and wanted to know who will carry out the review. We are required to carry out a review and I confirm that we shall do so thoroughly and, if there is a need for additional powers, we shall consider it. My hon. Friend the Member for Luton, South (Ms Moran) also mentioned funding for the Equality Commission. That is a matter for the devolved Administration and I am sure that there will be on-going dialogue between the commission and the Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde referred also to the need for the Republic of Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission to work together. Relations are good and communication between them is increasing. Indeed, in December, I attended an excellent conference in Dublin at which both commissions were represented. I echo my hon. Friend's call for collaboration, but I want to reassure him that it is taking place. More than 100 bodies have been designated and we are looking forward to a further tranche in the near future. We want to extend
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
section 75 to as many bodies as possible. The role of the Director of Public Prosecutions is complex and I do not want to be drawn too far about it today, but I cannot give my hon. Friend an absolute guarantee along the lines that he seeks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for North-East Derbyshire referred to disability discrimination, which falls within the scope of the Equality Commission. I know that Joan Harbison, the chairman of the Equality Commission, and her colleagues are aware of their obligations on that front and are anxious to move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for West Tyrone raised the issue of parades. In that respect, many elements of the European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998 conflict, but there are elements relating to people's rights to enjoy a peaceful life. I understand that the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is currently considering at the whole issue of parades and the Northern Ireland Parades Commission. The hon. Gentleman may want to make a submission to the Committee to air his concerns, or perhaps he has already done so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by paying tribute to the security forces, which have been endeavouring to cope with an increasingly difficult situation in Northern Ireland. I pay tribute to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Royal Irish Regiment, the other Army regiments deployed in Northern Ireland and all those involved in the security effort. It has been difficult, and they are doing their best to deal with the problems that confront them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was an attack this morning in Dungannon. I understand that a booby-trapped device was placed under the vehicle of a Roman Catholic male, who was seriously injured. Our thoughts are with him, and I hope that he makes a full recovery. I make it absolutely clear that my party and I condemn unreservedly the actions of whoever was responsible for that despicable attack. Sadly, it is only the latest in a series of terrorist incidents, which have seen a marked increase in violence in Northern Ireland. There is growing evidence that most, if not all, terrorist organisations operating in Northern Ireland have been involved in violence to various degrees. Violence is not exclusive to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0184">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
either republican or loyalist terror groups. It is perpetrated against the whole community and both traditions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) referred earlier to the situation in his hometown of Lame. We have all watched with concern the increase in violence there, which has recently been echoed in other parts of Northern Ireland. We have seen an increase not only in what was referred to earlier as conventional terrorism, but in so-called punishment attacks. In January this year, the number of such attacks reached almost three times the number in the same period last year. In January this year, there were 31 such attacks, 19 of which were carried out by loyalists and 12 by republican groups. In attacks that involved shootings, loyalists were responsible for nine attacks, and republicans were blamed for five attacks. The corresponding statistics for January 2000 were three loyalist and no republican shootings. We can clearly see the trend of a marked increase in violence in the form of so-called punishment attacks.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also evidence of the involvement of various terror groups in murder attempts and, indeed, in murder. Before the Christmas recess, I tabled a question about the murders of Paddy Joe Quinn in Magherafelt and Joseph O'Connor in Belfast. The Minister responded:
	<br><blockquote><p>"It would not be appropriate to speculate who is responsible for these murders as the RUC investigation is still ongoing. If it becomes clear that the IRA were responsible for the murders of Patrick Joe Quinn and Joseph O'Connor it would have a direct impact on the Secretary of State's assessment of the IRA ceasefire."—[	<i>Official Report,</i> 29 November 2000; Vol. 357, c. 637W.]</p></blockquote>
I ask the Minister to provide an update of the RUC's investigation into those two murders. Is there now sufficient evidence to indicate the IRA's involvement in those murders?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As well as the IRA being involved, there is growing evidence of the IRA having links to the so-called dissident republican groups. There is a significant overlap. Before Christmas, we had a booby-trap bomb in County Fermanagh at Lisnarick near Irvinstown. The device, placed under the car, consisted of a glass vial containing two pounds of commercial explosive inside a wooden box equipped with a tilt switch, timer and batteries. The bomb was attached to the car with a magnet. A security source, quoted in the 	<i>Belfast Telegraph</i> of 1 December, stated
	<br><blockquote><p>"the components appeared to have been taken out of an IRA arms dump at some time since the ceasefires.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The device was armed by a timer power unit—TPU—of a type used in many IRA bombs during its terror campaign."</p></blockquote>
Significantly, Semtex was used in the device and it is well know that Semtex is exclusively under the control of the Provisional IRA. Perhaps the Minister will be able to shed some light on this. As it is believed that dissident republicans were involved in this attack in County Fermanagh, evidence from security sources suggests that they have somehow accessed equipment previously under the control of the Provisional IRA. That causes us concern.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
Recently, I also raised the case of Joe Fee, a man who was briefly detained in the Irish Republic after the seizure in Croatia of weapons that were destined for the Real IRA. As I said, Mr. Fee, as an Irish Government employee, was sent in 1997 to work as an aid worker in the former Yugoslavia, alongside the charity Refugee Trust. There was an expose on the BBC "Spotlight" programme that provided evidence of Joe Fee's involvement in creating links between the Real IRA and Croatian arms smugglers. Those links opened up a line of supply for the Real IRA from the former Yugoslavia. Some of the weapons involved were subsequently found by the Irish police in the Irish Republic. The attack on the MI6 headquarters was carried out by the Real IRA, using weaponry smuggled in from Croatia.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is evidence that these republican groups are growing in membership and in their capacity to carry out serious terrorist attacks. I quote from 	<i>The Sunday Times,</i> 17 December:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Republican dissidents, who have secured the help of leading members of the Provisional IRA, are planning to plant a large bomb in London to mark the new year, according to British and Irish security sources.</p></blockquote>
	<br><blockquote><p>The Real IRA and Continuity IRA are collaborating and are now assisted by leading members of the Provisional IRA in Armagh and north Belfast."</p></blockquote>
Again, that is evidence of links between members of the Provisional IRA and dissident groups.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will be aware that, last week, the Irish police intercepted a vehicle near Mitchelstown, County Cork in which members of the Provisional IRA, it is believed, were caught in possession of three fully loaded, semi-automatic pistols, which had previously been smuggled in by the Provisional IRA, during the ceasefire, from Florida, USA. What were those Provisional IRA members doing in that vehicle with armed weapons and baseball bats? What were they up to? We have a ceasefire. It is complete and unequivocal.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will see that there are concerns. We have an escalating terrorist threat, and one that is not exclusive to the republican side. There is growing evidence that the Ulster Defence Association is involved in significant acts of violence on the streets of Northern Ireland, as are the Ulster Volunteer Force and other splinter loyalist paramilitary groups. Again, that calls into question the quality of those ceasefires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When will the Minister review the ceasefires of all terrorist organisations—in the light of the growing evidence of their involvement in acts of violence, in clear contradiction of the Mitchell principles on democracy and non-violence? If the Government establish that the ceasefires are regularly breached, as I believe that they are, what action will they take in response to that? Some of the ceasefires are clearly disintegrating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is also the issue of decommissioning. As the Minister will know, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reported just before Christmas that there had been no progress on the decommissioning of illegal terrorist weapons. The chairman of the commission, General John de Chastelain, reported:
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0185">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
	<br><blockquote><p>"We believe it is crucial that we have substantive engagement with the IRA representative as soon as possible, followed by early movement on actual decommissioning by each of the paramilitary groups, if we are to meet the Agreement's decommissioning requirements by the beginning of June."</p></blockquote>
As the Minister knows, June is the deadline for the completion of disarmament. Does the Minister expect that terrorist groups will meet the June deadline? When does he expect to receive another report from the IICD? What role does he envisage for the IICD beyond the end of June if decommissioning has not been completed by then—or even if it has not commenced—in terms of each of the mainstream terrorist groups?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I said, there is clearly escalating terrorist violence, which is matched by an increase in criminality in Northern Ireland. We are seeing a crime wave in many areas, including my own constituency. We had the tragic case recently of Mr. Foster, whose home—which is just 200 yds from the local police station—was broken into. He and his wife were subjected to cruel intimidation by their assailants. Mr. Foster had a heart condition and asked for medication; it was denied him and he subsequently passed away as a result of the incident.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People are saying to me, "We need to be protected from those criminals," but the police cannot cope with the situation because they are not recruiting new members. Recruitment to the full-time Reserve stopped more than a year ago, and there has been no recruitment to the regular police for some time. Police numbers are diminishing, and the Chief Constable cannot cope with the increased terrorist threat and the crime wave on the streets as well as meeting the demands of the Social Democratic and Labour Party and others for downsizing. Will the Minister assure me that there will be no further downsizing of the police until the security threat has been properly dealt with and police can be returned to the numbers that operate under normal conditions? We are far from normality in Northern Ireland, given the marked increase in terrorist violence. I hope that the Minister will assure me that the full-time Reserve will be retained for as long as the threat to security exists.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I quote from "Return to Normality", a document published by the Northern Ireland Office with which the Minister will be familiar:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The Government have an overriding duty to protect the community from threats from whatever quarter and in whatever form they come."</p></blockquote>
I believe that that duty extends to maintaining the security forces at a level at which they can cope with the existing threat and the crime wave on our streets— and that means that the Chief Constable must have enough officers to put on the streets in Larne, Coleraine, Lisburn, west Belfast—wherever it is needed. At the same time, sufficient troops must be available to provide support to the RUC, particularly in dealing with the terrorist threat. The Government must not allow political expediency to get in the way of doing what is necessary to protect the citizens of Northern Ireland—and those of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
As the Minister well knows, many of the bombs that end up in London originate in places such as South Armagh and north County Louth. If watchtowers and other security installations are removed, it will pose a risk not only to the lives of people in Northern Ireland, but to the whole of the United Kingdom. The frontier of South Armagh is the frontier of the United Kingdom, not just of Northern Ireland. I therefore urge the Minister not to reduce security in such places while a significant terrorist threat remains, as it certainly does at present.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are two main issues. The first is the quality of the ceasefire and the Government's intentions towards it. The Government cannot indefinitely turn a blind eye to violence on the streets. Secondly, we must maintain an appropriate level of security to deal with current threats. I hope that the Minister will provide some assurances on those matters.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>5.30 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I share the sentiments of the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) about the role of the security forces in Northern Ireland, which do a tremendous job in difficult circumstances in the front line. The general threat from dissident republicanism is targeted on the security forces, and we should always remember the brave and difficult job that they do. I also share the hon. Gentleman's sympathy towards the victims of terrorist actions in Dungannon this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall deal with the generality of the hon. Gentleman's comments, but he also raised a specific point about the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. The IICD is an independent body: it does not function at the whim or direction of the two Governments. The commission judges when it is right to report to the Governments and whether any movement has taken place. It is conscious of its role, having existed for a considerable time. In common with everyone else, it hoped to make much more progress on the back of the Good Friday agreement—and even before it took place. It was not to be, but it is wrong to speculate about the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman asked various pertinent questions and referred to the discussions aimed at resolution of these difficult matters as "secret negotiations". I tried to explain that such discussions were necessarily held in close confine, not paraded in front of the press and every individual. That is the only way to make progress in peace negotiations. I had hoped that the hon. Gentleman would appreciate the importance of the discussions. The aim is not to take us backwards, but to move forward. If the big prizes can be achieved, the clarification of the IICD's role might be a useful factor to emerge in the process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me provide a more detailed account of the actions of the Government and the security forces against the generality of terrorist activity in Northern Ireland. I shall make some observations about the specific threats outlined by the hon. Gentleman. The spate of pipe bomb attacks by sectarian extremists, which have put some areas of Northern Ireland in the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0186">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
grip of fear, and the equally vicious attempts of dissident republicans to maim and murder—further exemplified by last night's incident near Newry—have a common aim. They are both intended to wreck the Good Friday agreement, which was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland. The extremists show nothing but contempt for the will of the people; they have no mandate themselves; and they cannot respect the mandate of others. The two groups emanate from different sides of the sectarian divide, but have those characteristics in common.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make it clear that the Government are determined, as are all people of good will in Northern Ireland, that those groups and those individuals will not prevail. Those malevolent people will not be allowed to thwart the desire for peace and a longing for a normal society that is shared, I believe, by every decent family in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked for some specifics. The Government and the security forces are tackling the pipe bombers and the dissidents head on. The threat from sectarian attacks has been matched by a Province-wide police strategy, supported where necessary by the Army. Saturation patrolling, backed up by covert operations, has been introduced in key estates. Focused patrols, maximising the use of intelligence in particular areas, are liaising with the community to target areas of tension at times of high risk. In Larne alone, the number of patrol doubled last year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Sub-divisional commanders have also introduced additional patrols, and a regional mobile support unit, made up of officers with local knowledge, has conducted a series of searches. Hon. Members from Northern Ireland will be only too well aware of the considerable successes in recovering bomb-making equipment that have flowed from those searches. Local police commanders have also tailored this strategy to their local situation. The publication and launch of an eight-point plan in Coleraine is a good example of that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been real successes at local level: 63 people have been charged or reported for prosecution for sectarian offences in Larne over the last two years. The Government are intensely aware of the suffering caused to the victims of those attacks. I have first-hand experience of some of the areas concerned. On my visits there, I have met many of the victims and their families and many representatives of the wider community who represent their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The word "terrorism" is used so often that its meaning has been blunted, but it is the right word to describe the fear in which families and single people, young and old, are living in some areas. They are afraid to go to sleep at night in case they lower their guard. Closed-circuit television has been installed in some places to deter attacks on individuals and police are liaising closely with those victims.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to pay tribute to the professionalism and commitment of the police and the Army in facing this new spate of attacks. It is not an easy task, but they
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
are determined. I should also point out that the presence of the Army—back on the streets in Larne, Coleraine, north Belfast and now Derry——underlines the Government's absolute determination on that point. We have always said that normalisation will proceed in line with the level of the security threat. The Army's support of the police in these areas shows that we will not hesitate to deploy the resources necessary to protect the public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are also looking with our security advisers at evidence of any orchestration of attacks. Many attacks have been popularly attributed to the Ulster Defence Association. That is a notoriously fragmented organisation and the RUC believe that, while individual members of the UDA may be involved in some of the attacks, there is not evidence of direction or organisation by the UDA. However, I stress that we keep the status of the ceasefires of all paramilitary organisations under daily review. The Secretary of State and I have that issue at the very top of our daily agenda. No one should be in any doubt that we will act swiftly and decisively if we believe that any organisation is not observing its ceasefire.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am considering the merits of tailoring the hate crime provisions that apply in England and Wales, and that are aimed primarily at racially motivated offences, to Northern Ireland. Again, if we are satisfied that those provisions would help to combat crimes of sectarian hatred, we will act by bringing forward appropriate legislation to tackle such evils. However, the reality is that they will not be defeated by legislation alone. It needs the full engagement of all sections of the community. We are beginning to see yet again the importance of this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In view of the recent spate of pipe bomb attacks, I welcome the joint statement by Protestant Churches in Coleraine. The eight-point plan launched in that town by the police makes it absolutely clear that they attach the highest importance to support from community leaders. Only when the whole community makes it clear that the naked parading of sectarianism and the violence that flows from it are unacceptable and that it supports the police in tackling those problems will we have a normal society in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government and the security forces are playing their part. Others, including Members of Parliament, also have a role. Their role is not to chase political headlines but to help to create the inclusive society that I genuinely believe is achievable. If everyone of good will stands on the one side and argues for the changes that are essential in Northern Ireland, all the concepts envisaged in the Good Friday agreement can be realised. It is not simply a matter of attack and criticism but of seeing how we can move forward progressively on this.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Alongside the rise in sectarian attacks is the continuing threat from dissident republicans. I have spoken many times in the House about the seriousness with which the Government and the security forces regard this stream of attempted bombings. Again, I pay tribute to the vigilance of our security forces. As the Chief Constable recently pointed out, were it not for their vigilance, we would certainly have seen
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0187">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>45</span>
significant injury and loss of life as a result of dissident activities. It is worth while remembering some of the recent successes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In November, a four-man Real IRA unit was intercepted in County Fermanagh. Bomb-making equipment and a mortar destined for use on an RUC station was recovered. Later that month, a planned search uncovered a sniper's rifle and other weapons leading to three arrests in Londonderry. Two more arrests followed in Belfast in December and last month a large device was discovered in two camouflaged bins at Middletown in County Armagh. Despite those successes, neither we nor the security forces are complacent. The terrible injuries sustained by Reserve Constable Fegan from a bomb outside Castlewellan RUC station in November remind us of the price paid by the security forces in protecting the public. Those brave men and women put their lives at risk.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should also like to pay tribute to the RUC's colleagues in the Garda Siochana. They deserve our gratitude for their impressive successes against the dissidents. Since the Good Friday agreement, 39 people have been arrested in the Republic in connection with dissident groups; 21 have been convicted and the remainder are awaiting trial. Co-operation between the security forces has never been better, and it is paying real dividends.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important that we constantly keep all those issues under review. The Government are determined to help Northern Ireland make the transition to a normal society. We will continue to pursue the terrorists, from whatever fringe or extreme they may come. At the same time, we are shining a light into the dark side of Northern Ireland's society—the mafia-style subculture that brings misery to the whole community. The hon. Gentleman referred to that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are determined to cure this poisonous legacy of the troubles and we have shown our commitment through the establishment of the organised crime taskforce under my chairmanship and other far-reaching measures to combat financial crime. We will continue to pursue the gangsters and the terrorists with equal determination until the death throes of sectarianism are over and the violent fringe of bigotry and hatred is extinguished. I believe that that day is closer now than ever and much of that is due to the Good Friday agreement. I ask Northern Ireland Members to look at that agreement afresh and to look at the framework that it provides for moving Northern Ireland society forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>46</span>
We are not there yet. We still have difficulties before us, all of which we are seeking to resolve. Everyone has a role to play in taking this forward to achieve political agreement and a society based on partnership. I urge all Northern Ireland Members to look at those partnerships, at the positive developments and at the successes of the security forces. The Government are determined to move forward on two separate tracks. First, we want to maintain a level of security, and I have given good examples of how that has been achieved, and secondly, we want to bring forward a new political settlement. If we can win those two prizes of clamping down on the extremes and achieving the political framework needed to move Northern Ireland into a new civic society, it will be a huge feat. It will be historic. That is why I urge Northern Ireland Members to play a role in that. It is easy to criticise. They should get out there and start to sell the positive message rather than the negative.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising these issues. I have not dealt with all the specifics. I will obviously deal with them in writing. He knows that I will not deal with specific cases through exchanges in Committee and I certainly will not respond to speculation in the press about who is or is not responsible for particular murders. I take my advice from the Chief Constable. I hope that the hon. Gentleman has the same confidence in our security forces as I do.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
