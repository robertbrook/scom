	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the proposal for a draft Financial Investigations (Northern Ireland) Order 2001.</p></blockquote>
I think that most hon. Members present attended this morning's sitting of the Committee. To explain the background to this sitting, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs suggested that this Committee should consider the order. It is important, given the importance and the relevance of the measure, that we give it adequate consideration. I look forward to hon. Members expressing their views.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is an important measure, which has rightly attracted much comment in Northern Ireland and has been considered in depth by the Assembly. The views of the Assembly, on which I will comment later, will assist my officials and me in finalising the content of the order, and the views expressed by this Committee will help me in similarly. I turn to the background and the purpose of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In September, the then Secretary of State drew attention to the problem of organised crime in Northern Ireland. He said that although the focus of Government had rightly been concentrated on defeating terrorism, we must reach further and grip the organised crime that it has spawned. He recognised that that blight on our society is a many-sided problem which demands different answers from different agencies, united by a single purpose. The measures announced in September included the setting up of an organised crime taskforce, which my right hon. Friend asked me to chair, and important changes in legislation. This draft Order in Council represents one of those multi-agency approaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The troubles have left Northern Ireland with a sad legacy of organised criminality. However, dealing with that legacy is essential if Northern Ireland is to achieve the creation of a stable and truly peaceful society. The police and other agencies involved in law enforcement have done a great deal to meet that challenge and, working with professionalism, determination and skill, they have had considerable success.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
However, criminals change and adapt. They are adept at seeking out new opportunities to prey on society, new ways of avoiding detection, and new ways of concealing their illegal gains. The Government recognise that there is no simple way of dealing with the problem, no single solution to the stranglehold of organised crime, so we are introducing, as part of a coherent strategy, a number of related initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One element of the Government's strategy is to pursue the proceeds of crime and to drain away the financial lifeblood of criminals. By preventing criminals from profiting from crime and by removing the profits of those who have committed crime, not only do we create a powerful deterrent to criminality, but we make it harder for organised criminals to commit further crime and sustain themselves through financing new initiatives. We also provide important reassurance to ordinary people who no longer see criminals flaunting their ill-gotten wealth. As a bonus, the money recovered can be used for the benefit of society rather than against it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposals in the draft proceeds of crime Bill, which was announced by the Home Secretary on 5 March, are an essential part of the overall strategy. They follow the report of the Cabinet Office's performance and innovation unit, published last June. That report, commissioned by the Prime Minister in late 1999, showed that criminals and their associates are too often able to retain their ill-gotten gains, even if they have been successfully convicted and imprisoned. The report made a number of recommendations for change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft proceeds of crime Bill, which extends to the whole of the United Kingdom, contains measures to improve the recovery of illegally obtained assets. Those include strengthened powers to confiscate assets where there has been a criminal conviction and new powers to tax criminal assets. It also contains significant new powers for the civil recovery of criminal asset—spowers that can be used where it is impossible to secure a criminal conviction. The draft Bill also outlines plans to set up a criminal assets recovery agency empowered to investigate and recover property believed to be the proceeds of criminal conduct.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The structures envisaged in the Bill take special account of the needs of Northern Ireland. The Bill provides that the criminal assets recovery agency will include a senior official with special responsibility for Northern Ireland, and that the new agency's plans will specifically meet the needs of Northern Ireland. Those provisions mean that the agency will be able to co-operate fully with other enforcement bodies in Northern Ireland and work in a manner that fully takes into account the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, including the presence of a land border and the legacy of paramilitarism.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order before us is another element of the strategy to pursue the proceeds of crime. Currently, the main Northern Ireland legislation dealing with criminal finance is the Proceeds of Crime (Northern Ireland) Order 1996. That order updated and restated the law relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0209">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
drug trafficking and other serious crime. A key provision of the 1996 order, in article 49, was the introduction of additional investigative powers through the appointment of a financial investigator to assist the police in carrying out investigations into the proceeds of crime. The extensive powers of financial investigators are set out in schedule 2. Among those is the power to issue a general bank circular for the purpose of identifying accounts held by named individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The powers provided in the 1996 order are in addition to the normal powers of investigation available to the police. They are used only in selected cases, following a determination of a county court judge that the appointment of a financial investigator could substantially enhance the investigation. Experience of operating the legislation has shown that it has worked well. Between August 1996 and December 2000, financial investigators were appointed in 28 cases. During that period, 23 general bank circulars were issued, resulting in the identification of more than 1,200 previously unknown accounts connected with people under investigation. However, experience has also shown that elements of the order need to be adjusted and strengthened.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister says that more than 1,200 unknown accounts have been identified. Were all those accounts in Northern Ireland, were all of them in the United Kingdom or were some of them outwith the United Kingdom? If some of them were outwith the United Kingdom, how were they discovered?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not have a breakdown of all of the accounts to hand, but if that can be made available, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman. He raises an interesting point, because of course accounts may be outwith the Northern Ireland jurisdiction, and an audit trail of any investigation may elicit such information. I will discover whether we can provide a breakdown of those 1,200 cases to show whether they were exclusively within the Northern Ireland jurisdiction or reached beyond it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having set out the success of the 1996 order, I was saying that we had identified various ways in which it could be adjusted and strengthened. The proposal for a draft order before us contains a number of practical proposals for improvement that have resulted from discussions with and between law enforcement agencies in Northern Ireland. It is a short order that makes several amendments to the 1996 order. It has four main provisions, which I shall briefly set out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 3 enables Customs and Excise officers to apply for the appointment of a financial investigator to assist them with investigations into the proceeds of crime. That power is currently available only to the police. The article also permits court-authorised customs officers, like their police counterparts, to issue general circulars to financial institutions and solicitors.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
Article 4 provides financial investigators with the same powers of access to material under a production order as are currently available to the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 effectively widens the range of financial institutions to which a general bank circular may be issued. As I have said, a general bank circular may be issued to banks, requiring them to identify accounts held by a named person. At present, the issue of such a circular is restricted to institutions involved in banking in the narrow sense, such as banks and building societies. However, as recognised in the report of the National Criminal Intelligence Service on the threat from serious and organised crime, there is a trend in money laundering away from use of banks and building societies towards greater use of securities, futures, options and insurance markets. The article is therefore designed to meet that perceived threat.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is proposed that in future such circulars may be issued to institutions that provide a much wider range of financial and insurance services. Effectively, that means services subject to the Money Laundering Regulations 1993. That includes not only banks and building societies, but investment firms, insurance companies and others in the regulated financial sector.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 6 creates the power to issue a general solicitors' circular—an entirely new means of helping investigators establish the beginnings of an audit trail in the search for the proceeds of crime. In future, investigators will be able to issue a circular to all or any firms of solicitors, asking them to identify whether they have acted for a named client on certain matters that relate mostly to property and assets. When a person is identified as a client, the solicitor will be obliged to provide information about him, including the nature of the transaction in which the solicitor acted. The solicitor must say whether the transaction involved land, a business and so on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That power will be especially helpful in tracing land transactions in the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland. Not only are there two systems for registration of land in Northern Ireland, but the registration of title is not at present generally compulsory. Moreover, any inquiry regarding ownership of land can be made only by reference to the property, rather than to the owner.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 introduces an exception to the standard period in which a prosecution of a summary offence should be brought. At present, the period is six months after the offence was committed. The exception is in relation to summary proceedings for an offence of failing to provide information, or of falsifying it. For such proceedings, the time limit for prosecutions will be three months from the date on which sufficient evidence to prosecute becomes available, or 12 months from the commission of the offence, whichever is later. It is often some time after a financial crime has been committed before the offence is discovered, such as when it comes to light through the examination of accounts.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On 21 November, the then Secretary of State laid the proposals before Parliament. He also referred them to the Northern Ireland Assembly for consideration, and launched a public consultation exercise. The Assembly
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0210">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
has dealt with the issue in depth, having taken evidence from a wide range of key organisations with an interest, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Law Society of Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Bankers Association, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the committee on the administration of justice. That evidence helped the Assembly's understanding of the extent and nature of the order, and we have received representations from those bodies as well. Our consideration of the order has been helped by the way in which the Assembly dealt with it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister satisfied that the order will cover many alleged cash transactions—when people arrive with a suitcase of readies to do business—that occur when accounts are not held?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The order relates specifically to criminal investigations or matters arising from criminal convictions. It also relates to the draft proceeds of crime Bill, which lowers the burden of proof to the civil requirement and gives greater power to the investigating authorities in pursuing that type of activity. The precise answer to the hon. Gentleman is yes. We will have more powers once the rest of the Government's intentions are put into law.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was setting out the range of responses that we and the Northern Ireland Assembly have received to the draft order. All the responses have been helpful. It would not be appropriate for me to deal with the various observations that have been made because, clearly, we must look at them in the round. We must then look at possible ways of amending the order in the light of relevant observations. In considering the responses already received, I should also like to take into account any issues that are raised in Committee today. We have already made a decision in respect of one part of the order, and that is in response to a suggestion made by, among others, the Northern Ireland Assembly about the code of practice for investigators. That will need to be revised and updated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that a number of concerns were expressed during the consultation about the human rights aspects of the proposed legislation. Many of those concerns were misplaced and did not take fully into account the rights of ordinary, law-abiding people. I am conscious that the Government have an overriding duty to protect people's right to life and the right of liberty and security of person. All that is put in jeopardy by the actions of organised criminals. The proposals are a proportionate response to the threat to human rights posed by crime and criminality and are no more intrusive than is necessary.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Individuals' rights will be protected in several ways. For example, before a financial investigator can be appointed, a county court judge must be satisfied that doing so is justified. Before a general bank circular or a general solicitors' circular can be issued, investigators must have reasonable grounds to believe that a person may have benefited from serious crime. The order's provisions are designed to help ensure that individuals
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
are correctly identified, and the code of practice governing financial investigations will be revised to assist in that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft Order in Council is just one of a number of elements in a wider strategy that will put further pressure on criminals and the resources that they control. The power to issue a solicitors' circular is unique to Northern Ireland. Reservations and concerns have been raised about that, not least by the Law Society of Northern Ireland. I understand those concerns but I believe that the order is proportionate, complies with the Human Rights Act 1998 and, importantly, addresses the wider needs of society in tackling the scourge of organised crime.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful for the responses that we have received. I know that hon. Members have a keen interest in the matter. Coming from Northern Ireland, they can see the effects of some of the things that I have mentioned. I look forward to hearing their comments on the order. We will seriously and genuinely take on board all substantive points. We must make work not only the order but the wider strategy of tackling organised crime in Northern Ireland today.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>2.48 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is a pleasure, Mr. McWilliam, to have you back in the Chair this afternoon. You are getting plenty of Northern Ireland business today. We shall try to make it as easy as we can for you and not stray out of order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are now seeing one of the offshoots of devolution to Northern Ireland, as this aspect of the law is not one that falls under the control of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The financial order was referred to the Assembly and the Ad Hoc Committee produced a report, which went before the Assembly. It is curious that, although the Secretary of State referred the order to the Assembly, the consequences of its investigations and discussions were not to return to the Secretary of State. Perhaps they were transferred to the Secretary of State via the Assembly. We must get the matter cleared up. It is a shadow-land problem which we have seen before as the work of various devolved institutions has developed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister was right to declare that there is always a conflict between the protection of individual rights and what is good for the community. That issue is likely to be aired in Committees again and again. It takes two to tango, but only one to raise a row and keep it going. We all know that that is true, and not just with respect to Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This is our second sitting today and I want once again to express my disappointment that Members of two of the major parties in Northern Ireland—the Democratic Unionist party and the Social and Democratic Labour party—are absent from our proceedings. I was under the impression that we were elected to represent the interests of all constituents under the Parliament of the United Kingdom, where the ultimate responsibility for governance of the Province lies—especially regarding aspects of life that we are debating today, for which responsibility rests solely with this House. I am sorry that hon. Members
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0211">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
from those two parties have forgotten that fact and I hope that the electors of Northern Ireland will take account of it when they cast their votes in the coming weeks.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have received an apology from the Conservative Front Bencher, the hon.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: As you will recall, Mr. McWilliam, it was formerly the responsibility of the Government to ensure a quorum so that they could get their business through the House. If the Opposition have any responsibility, it is to forsake the Government if they think fit—as they often do. I am pleased that for this sitting the Government have provided sufficient Members to maintain a quorum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On behalf of my political party, I welcome the order. We hope that it will strengthen law aimed at preventing criminals profiting financially from their illegal activities. No one with real knowledge of Northern Ireland in recent times can be unaware of the extent of problems connected with moneys illegally obtained. The order can therefore be recommended as a genuine attempt by the Government to improve matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent weeks, we have had a dreadful reminder, reinforced today by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in County Louth in the Irish Republic, of where criminality can lead. There are large, serious and unforeseen financial consequences for the whole nation of such activity. Clearly, sheep brought into Northern Ireland for illegal purposes led to the initial outbreak in South Armagh, which is now spreading God knows where. That illegal act had illegal downstream consequences; people engaged in such criminal activity cannot be as forthright with the authorities as one would wish. Therefore, the spread of the disease is greatly helped.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Existing legislation provides enforcement authorities with more powers at all stages of the confiscation process. Confiscation procedures in courts have been enhanced and enforcement powers once a confiscation order has been made have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
improved. The provisions were initially relatively successful when implemented in 1996. However, time passes, and those intent on criminal activity develop means of subverting new laws. They have done so on this occasion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is essential that the Government do all that is possible to ensure that convicted criminals are deprived of the profits of their activity. Not only must the perpetrators of crime be brought to justice, it is only right that their ill-gotten gains should be taken away from them. It is no good sentencing a man to two or three years in prison for drug dealing or robbery if he can walk out at the end of it straight into a life of luxury and reap the financial benefits of his dreadful activities, which brought misery to many people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The 1996 law, uniquely to Northern Ireland, provided for the appointment by the county court of a civilian financial investigator to aid police in their investigations. The provision is unique to the Province solely because of the presence of terrorism and of illegally obtained paramilitary-held money in our society. A court case in Dublin recently, which arose from the murder of a journalist, was not paramilitary but drugs-related. Perhaps the matter goes beyond paramilitary activity right into the drugs scene and the violent crime that has become such a prominent part of society in Northern Ireland—and, indeed, in the rest of the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Because of the involvement of paramilitary groups, which are the main driving force behind lucrative organised crime in Northern Ireland, we must never underestimate the importance of tackling issues of finance. It is only by making organised crime less profitable that we can ever hope to remove it from our streets.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In recent times, the number of so-called punishment beatings—mutilations and so on—by paramilitary groups has risen to record levels. In the current political process, the groups have largely been left alone to housekeep in their communities. What the communities think of that is of course a different matter. It would be naive to believe that in such an environment only beatings have increased. Drug dealing, smuggling and myriad other forms of racketeering have had far too much freedom to thrive, and they have done so. The problem is not getting smaller, it is growing, and the law must become more comprehensive to match it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The order does not explicitly mention terrorism, but it should. However, it does take us in the right direction. Current legislation is no longer as effective as it needs to be. It must be strengthened, and that is why we welcome the order. Criminal elements are moving beyond what was legislated against in 1996. Traditionally, banks were used as the chief means of money laundering, but that has now spread into the real estate—or property—sector and into the realm of solicitors. We need tougher legislation to combat a tougher, more dangerous and more diverse situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Due to time constraints, I shall limit my references to what I regard as the most contentious issues in the order. Articles 1, 2, and 8 are almost entirely procedural and I need not refer to them. Articles 3 and
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0212">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
4 merely extend the powers already available to appointed financial investigators, thus enabling them more effectively to carry out investigations in the pursuit of justice. They extend rights of access for financial investigators to those currently afforded only to the police. That is a wholly sensible step. They also bring closer together the authority of police and customs officers in conducting financial investigations. That should increase the effectiveness of our law enforcement bodies and it is to be welcomed. Especially welcome is the closer co-operation that it should bring about between the Revenue and the police.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, one of the largest sources of illegal wealth is the smuggling of all sorts of fuel. Despite the slight changes made by the Chancellor in his recent Budget, it will not stop. It is an horrendous problem, and the sums of money that go astray can only be guessed at. Whenever we try to obtain firm figures from the Treasury, we are told that nothing can be produced that makes sense. Perhaps the numbers are so astronomical that they do not make sense to normal human beings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 5 broadens the powers available to a financial investigator to demand and be entitled to receive information from anyone carrying out relevant financial business in connection with the individuals under suspicion. It is hoped that that measure will make the detection and proof of financial irregularities much more straightforward. I know that some will argue that such a provision would limit the individual's right to a private life, but even the European convention on human rights recognises that the prevention of crime is sufficient reason for interfering with the right of criminals to a private life.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Article 7 extends the time limits within which prosecutions must be brought if false information has been provided or if information has been withheld. In those circumstances it seems only reasonable and logical that the available time be increased. If the time limit is too short, those under investigation will be more likely to provide false information and true information is more likely to be withheld.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that that will be time consuming? If it is to be effective, it should not be another imposition, another task required of police officers and customs officials. Substantial additional funding must be made available fully to finance the additional costs that will arise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a sound point, especially with regard to the Revenue. The extra revenue generated by stopping the smuggling will more than pay for an army of investigative officers. I hope that the Minister heard what my hon. Friend has said and that he will speak to his friends in the Treasury. He may be going over barren ground again, like the rest of us, but it is a serious matter that has led to the control of legitimate businesses passing into the hands of terrorist organisations through front organisations. We want to see that reversed, but it will be difficult to achieve.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
Article 6 is likely to provoke the most debate and deliberation, and understandably so. I shall give it rather more attention. It requires a solicitor to confirm whether a named individual was his client in respect of certain types of non-contentious business, examples of which are land, business, investment or savings transactions. If so, the solicitor will be required to reveal certain details about the client and the transactions. That will have profound implications for the confidential relationship between a solicitor and his client. I sometimes think that that relationship is akin to the power that we have to speak without fear of retribution within the confines of the House. That power is important and necessary for citizens and for the legal profession. I hope that the Minister will consider that point, because, previously, legal professional privilege ensured that anything that a client said to his solicitor was strictly confidential.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Solicitor-client confidentiality was protected by law, but this article diminishes that protection, and should apply only where there is the most serious need. The Law Society has expressed grave concern about the provision, backed by valid arguments. The Law Commission sees legal professional privilege as a cornerstone of democratic justice, just as we regard the right to free speech as a cornerstone of democracy in this nation. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission also questions this encroachment on the previously sacrosanct relationship between solicitor and client—not that I usually have much time for the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
During debates in the Assembly, the Secretary of State was pressed to consult the legal profession. Has that consultation taken place or when will it take place? Was a satisfactory compromise reached between the need to prosecute criminals and the right to confidentiality or is there still a large gap between the positions of the Government and the legal profession? In Northern Ireland, we are often told that a gap has been closed when it is evident to the rest of us that it is as wide as the grand canyon.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Royal Ulster Constabulary has welcomed the measure as a means of preventing the perpetrators of crime from benefiting from their activities. In recent years, the often unwitting assistance of professional advisers has made legally obtained money extremely difficult to identify and retrieve. The law needs to be changed to tackle that effectively, and the order is part of that change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The objective of this article is to prevent those who are involved in money laundering from misusing the services of a solicitor. If there is evidence that a solicitor's services have been used improperly, it is only right that such evidence should be made available to the authorities. However, there is a conflict of rights; the right of society to fight crime successfully is pitted against an individual's right to privacy in his legal affairs. It is a serious issue. In discussing the provisions, we must remember that we are not dealing with minor financial irregularities, but, in some cases, with enormous sums of money—money that has come from activities that damage our societies and many
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0213">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
individuals in society, money from drug trafficking, armed robbery and all manner of organised crime, orchestrated by paramilitary groupings and others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister and everyone else knows, there are people in Northern Ireland who are driving around in cars worth £20,000, live in luxury and go on two or three foreign holidays every year, but whom we are supposed to believe live on unemployment benefit, which they collect every week. That is happening now and we need to ask serious questions about it. Those people who are apparently living above the standard that one might expect of those receiving social security benefits can be investigated, but only by way of a slow, tortuous process. In addition, the various officers involved in the social security benefit system are dispersed throughout the United Kingdom. A police officer investigating someone in my town of Dungiven might have to go to Newcastle or somewhere else in Great Britain, as well as visiting various bodies in Northern Ireland. I do not know why that is necessary. We should have an arrangement that enables all the information to be brought up on one computer screen in a central office in Belfast. That should be addressed by the social security benefit system.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That process is not only slow and tortuous, but individuals sometimes have to be observed by Government agents working for the social security fraud squad. That is not an entirely safe employment in Northern Ireland. In fact, it is a very dangerous employment there, particularly because of the involvement of terrorist organisations in benefit fraud. As the Minister knows, those organisations are sometimes also involved in drugs, and the sentences handed down when such people are brought to book should reflect all these matters and be a real deterrent to those who get involved in social security benefit fraud. Such fraud is part and parcel of the misappropriation of funds and of criminal activity as a whole in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As I have said, we need look no further than the state of the farming community. Families who have worked honestly for years, indeed for a lifetime, are struggling to pay bills, particularly in areas affected by foot and mouth disease, which now seems to be coming home to roost in Northern Ireland, and perhaps in the rest of Ireland as well. By contrast, the organised criminal element and the paramilitary element, who, through drug dealing, smuggling or theft, contaminate, corrupt and corrode our communities, are richly rewarded for doing so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is through such illegal activities that terrorism is financed, although individuals also engage in them for their own private gain. Terrorists are able to appear as wealthy, law-abiding citizens, running legitimate businesses. There is a huge criminal conspiracy in Northern Ireland, its tentacles reaching into every level of society and every corner of the Province. Very often, folk are unable to work out how Joe or Liam Bloggs has managed to get so much money, have a high standard of living and run a successful business when two years before he did not have a halfpenny.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The money does not come out of thin air—it comes from somewhere, and often its only source is criminal activity. Of course, there are some people who win the lottery or the pools, or do particularly well in business, but the locals often wonder how on earth certain people can be so prosperous for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is no good reason—good, bad or indifferent—why any individual or group should be allowed to profit from illegal activities. Legislation must be effectively enforced, but before that can happen, the legislation must be drafted to ensure that when it is applied, it is effective. Too many high lifestyles in Northern Ireland are being supported by illegally obtained money. That must be stamped out and the order goes a little further down that road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appreciate that the Government want to tread cautiously because of the conflict—it is at the heart of the matter—between freedom, the necessity of privacy and the need to investigate crime and prosecute those who are engaged in it in a proper manner that will give confidence to people. To be kind to the Minister, I must say that we wish him, and those who have to apply the legislation, well.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>3.12 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) for his contribution, and for his overall acceptance of the order. He raised several important points that are worthy of response, and I will try to deal with all of them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the way in which the order has been dealt with relative to the Secretary of State's relationship with the Northern Ireland Assembly. Under section 85(5) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the Secretary of State is obliged to refer the proposal to the Assembly. However, the Assembly can choose whether or not to report to the Secretary of State after a referral. The Secretary of State can also require a report. On this occasion, he did not require a report, but we were happy to receive the one that the Assembly chose to prepare. I mentioned, in my opening remarks, how that will help the Secretary of State and me in the final drafting of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman raised matters relating to terrorism and organised crime and the relationship between such activities. He commented that the order does not mention terrorism. He is right, but it does not exclude the pursuit of organised crime perpetrated by those engaged in terrorist paramilitary activity. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the RUC has helpfully produced an overall threat analysis of organised criminal activity in Northern Ireland. It is not yet in the public domain, but will be published shortly. Also, as I said, I chair an organised crime task force that brings together all the agencies—the RUC, Customs and Excise, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and others. I propose to publish an overview of what we have learnt from that analysis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0214">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
All that will increase our understanding of the extent, nature and depth of organised crime in Northern Ireland society. That understanding will not be perfect, but we are learning all the time; the more we explore, probe and learn, the better we are able to engage the threat as it manifests itself.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of fuel smuggling, which is a serious problem. Sometimes there are joint initiatives between the RUC and Customs and Excise. Sometimes those agencies act separately, but in the main, Customs and Excise lead, because of the Revenue implications. Last year, 13 fuel laundering plants that were capable of producing 40 million litres of fuel a year were shut down. That is a considerable achievement on the part of Customs and Excise. To date, in the financial year 2000–01, 1.3 million litres of illicit fuel have been seized. Not just fuel but other contraband goods such as cigarettes are smuggled—50 million cigarettes have also been seized as a consequence of joint RUC and Customs and Excise activity.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us how many prosecutions have resulted from those activities? We hear about lorries being impounded and illegal activity, but we do not hear so much about anyone being prosecuted for it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingrain</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Many of the seizures are of recent vintage and in some cases charges have been proffered but convictions have not yet resulted because of the time taken to deal with cases in court proceedings. I share the hon. Gentleman's view that, where possible, there should be convictions on the back of those seizures. He has my assurance that I will continue to monitor and press for such convictions.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry asked about article 6 and client-solicitor privilege, which has generated comment. Let me set out some of the background to that. The 1996 order provides that the powers will be used only when a county court judge is satisfied that they will enable a police or Customs and Excise investigation to be carried out more effectively. The current proposal also ensures that the financial investigator will issue such a circular only where it appears to him that a specified person has benefited from serious criminal conduct. The information that the solicitor is required to provide is in the first instance limited and the 1996 order already requires solicitors to furnish names and addresses of clients, so in that sense the power will not be an entirely new step. Only when a solicitor's response suggests that one or more of the limited transactions specified have been carried out may an application be made to the court for access to that information.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The proposal recognises the importance of protecting legal privilege as far as possible, and provides that such applications will give notice to the relevant solicitor, thereby enabling any issues of legal privilege to be determined by a judge. The hon. Gentleman asked whether we have met the Law
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Society of Northern Ireland. No such meetings have yet taken place—they are being arranged—but it gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Assembly and was consulted by the Northern Ireland Office on the order. However, we must remember that the Law Society does not own the law—it belongs to us all—and should not have a veto over what the Government want to do. It does not want that particular veto, and those who have read the evidence it submitted for the Assembly's consideration of the order have found it to be helpful.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman suggested that the proposals could undermine the relationship between solicitors and their clients. I do not accept that. I recognise the importance of solicitors' principles and that client confidentiality and legal professional privilege are important. However, as the Law Society admitted to the Northern Ireland Assembly, if there is any question of furthering criminal intent, that would not be covered by privilege or confidentiality. The right safeguards have been built into the proposals to ensure that clients can continue to trust their solicitors to preserve confidentiality. The obligation on solicitors to report to the police or NCIS any suspicious transactions as defined by our current money laundering offences has effectively weakened the duty of confidentiality that solicitors owe to their clients. Therefore, there has already been an acceptance in law of the need to tackle organised crime. That has been accepted by the Law Society, which is obliged to recognise that we are all affected by criminality. That should have primacy in our consideration of the order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question of fraud against the public purse—benefit fraud for example. I agree that we need to tackle such fraud, and the RUC recently undertook a survey of criminality against the public purse. The social security system is now devolved, and it no longer falls to the Secretary of State or me to take on his suggestion about the need for centralised records. I am sure that he will make his views on that known to the Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Some parts of the system have been centralised to Newcastle and other parts to elsewhere, so it is not a question of it all being devolved to Northern Ireland. Certain things for the whole of the United Kingdom are centralised in Great Britain.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ingram</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. I do not claim to be an expert on all aspects of social security, but I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security has introduced specific measures to tackle benefit fraud. Everyone is aware of its extent, and we need more sophisticated systems and tracking approaches. That will not come overnight. It needs careful consideration and resources, but the Government's intention is clear: we are determined to stamp out fraud. I know that the hon. Gentleman would agree about the important role played by the RUC to date in conducting the survey into criminality in the public sector in Northern Ireland, which will
<span class="label imageref" title="SC2000-2001V005P0I0215">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
help all agencies—not only in Northern Ireland, but in a wider net. Initiatives that are taken in Northern Ireland might help the UK in general; equally, matters developed elsewhere in the UK might assist us in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have had a useful, albeit short, debate. I welcome the hon. Gentleman's acceptance of the order on behalf of his party. He is right that we wish those with responsibility for taking forward the
