	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Before I call Lord Dubs to make his statement on a regional strategic framework for Northern Ireland, I should explain how I propose to conduct this morning's proceedings. When the Minister has finished, I shall endeavour to call all hon. Members who rise to ask a question. There is no time limit on the statement or on discussion of it, but I must bear in mind that there will be a debate on the same subject immediately afterwards, which has to finish by one o'clock. If hon. Members co-operate by asking short questions, I might be able to call them more than once, but my ability to do that is in their hands.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.31 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Lord Dubs)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Committee for giving me the opportunity to make a statement. I should like to speak about the work of my Department in developing a regional strategy for Northern Ireland. I should welcome views on key topics that the Committee considers should feature in the regional development strategy, and I shall refer to its place in the Good Friday Agreement. I shall of course, take questions at the end of the statement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Let me start with the origins of the project. During an inquiry into land-use planning in 1996, the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs considered that there was a need for a regional plan along the lines of the regional planning guidance statements that are produced for England and Wales. In their response, the Government of the day accepted that recommendation, and the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland began to consider how it might be delivered,.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As we investigated the best way to approach the task, it became evident that regional planning guidance in the United Kingdom and, indeed, in Europe was about more than land-use planning. Notably, sustainable development had become an increasingly significant consideration in the development of policies. Hon. Members will be familiar with the Bruntland definition of sustainable development, which was offered in 1987. It states that sustainable development is
	<br><blockquote><p>"development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".</p></blockquote>
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
The Earth summit in Rio in 1992 brought that concept to the world state. Slowly but surely it has become more and more influential in policy development right across the spectrum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The change of Government in May 1997 presented an opportunity to give further impetus to the development of a regional strategy for Northern Ireland. It is fair to say that the preparation of a regional strategic framework for the future development of Northern Ireland has become an extremely exciting challenge. It represents a unique opportunity to help create a region that will fulfil a bold long-term vision. For the first time, we have begun to tackle, on a cross-Departmental basis, the inter-relationships between where people live, work, socialise and spend their leisure time. The framework offers a unique opportunity. The Government's comprehensive approach to looking ahead to the next 25 years is unique, and I can find no other example of such an ambitious and exciting project.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In announcing the beginning of work on the development of the regional strategy in June 1997, the Secretary of State said:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Our task is to devise a coherent, integrated strategy for the development of the region well into the next century; a strategy that effectively addresses the region's critical economic, social, environmental and community problems."</p></blockquote>
It was evident then there was strong support for an approach that would go beyond conventional land-use planning principles to consider strategic issues relating to agriculture, education, the economy, health, the environment and the matter of a divided society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Our approach is to develop a long-term vision for the region, setting clear goals, rather than simply accepting current trends. We are at the leading edge in the UK and Europe in developing a long-term strategy to take us to 2025.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The strategy will become the overarching framework in which policies and programmes can be co-ordinated and integrated. It will also provide a framework for the subsequent preparation of more detailed local plans. The Government aspire to have a strong economy, a sustainable environment and an inclusive society. It is right that the people of Northern Ireland should enjoy those qualities in their region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I should like to refer to four initiatives that are important in themselves, but which will also feed into the regional strategic framework and will in turn, be informed by the work that we heave done and are still doing on it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The first is sustainable development, which the Government have put to the forefront of our national policies. We want to raise standards of living and quality of life through economic development, but in a way that protects and enhances the environment. We must try to ensure that the benefits of vibrant economy and of healthy environment are enjoyed by all sectors of society and by future generations as well as our own. That also applies to Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0702">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
The second initiative concerns integrated transport policy. The Government are working on the development of such a policy, which is especially important in Northern Ireland. Compared to those of other regions, Northern Ireland's regional transportation system is underdeveloped and requires considerable investment. Following the publication of the Governments White Paper on transport policy, I shall publish a complementary policy statement about transport in Northern Ireland. It will enable me to highlight the specific ways in which transport in Northern Ireland is different, and to deal with the reflection of those differences in policy development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third main initiative is the waste management strategy. The Government recognise the relationship between health and the environment, so in Northern Ireland we have begun the task of developing a waste management strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However the development of a regional strategy also seeks to take account of other policy initiatives. For example, in the Government's White Paper, "Partnership for Equality" in March 1998, the Secretary of State wrote:
	<br><blockquote><p>"We all have an interest in a stable, secure society. To be that, it has also to be a fair society, whether government is by Direct Rule, as now, or by agreed new arrangements."</p></blockquote>
The fourth initiative concerns economic development strategy. We have decided to prepare such a strategy for Northern Ireland. While it will focus on detailed aspects of economic development, there are important relationships between spatial and economic matters. For that reason, the two strategies are being taken forward in parallel, with close liaison between the two Departments responsible: the Department of Economic Development and the Department of the Environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are all aware that each policy impacts on many others and is interdependent with them. The links between the quality of our environment and people's health and well being are interconnected. They have a bearing on how well the local economy performs, which means that we must strive for social equity and equality of opportunity.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Equality of opportunity and equity of treatment are implicit principles that feature throughout the Government's policies, whether they relate to strengthening the economy, education, agriculture, health and social services or the environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The regional strategic framework offers a chance to set the direction for the region by linking the policies in a way that is appropriate for its specific needs and aspirations. It will guide future development of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
For that reason the Government are committed to a regional approach where it will ensure that our policies are introduced in the most appropriate way. In the light of recent political development, that is especially relevant in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
In many ways, the preparatory work already done locally on transportation and on beginning the development of a regional strategic framework, waste management, sustainable development and the review of the economic strategy, is likely to be helpful to the New Assembly, but I shall say more about the New Assembly's relationship with regional strategy later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall now turn to the most important part of the process so far. Long-term planning for the region is a complex task. Reaching agreement about the most appropriate regional strategic framework involves difficult choices and decisions affecting the whole community. Therefore, every effort has been made fully to engage all sections of the community in the important process of preparing an agreed final version of the strategy. That has meant a lively and vibrant debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Having made the initial announcement in June about the development of the regional strategy, I responded to concerns that it would be more sensible to reach decisions on the future development of the Belfast city region, an exercise that began in January 1996, within the context of an overall strategy for Northern Ireland. In September 1997, when I announced the decision to merge the two exercises, I said that I wanted to have them settled together by the end of 1998. To give effect to the merging of the projects a major conference was held in Belfast on 27 November 1997. To coincide with that conference, the Department published a discussion paper, "Shaping our Future", and invited everyone with an interest to submit comments by the end of March 1998. Hon. Members will have seen in the discussion paper the merging thinking that has been formulated through extensive consultations with those in the Belfast city region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We were acutely aware of the desire of the citizens of the region to take ownership of their destiny; and the wish to develop a sense of civic pride and responsibility should be nurtured and cultivated rather than stifled. It will come as no surprise to some members of the Committee that we received more than 200 replies to the "Shaping our Future" discussion paper. We distributed almost 20,000 copies and the document was also accessible on a dedicated web site.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the conference, officials from my Department had meetings with each of the 26 district councils, all of whom have now presented their views to us, and staff had meetings with more than 100 interest groups, either individually or through a series of seminars that were organised to aid consideration of the discussion paper. Significantly, we arranged for a university-led consortium to help groups from the voluntary and community sectors to engage in the debate. That consortium organised regional conferences and workshops across the region, which were attended by representatives of more than 350 groups. The rural community in Northern Ireland has also taken up the challenge and has advanced strong arguments as to why we must respect their role in the region.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0703">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
The Secretary of State attended two youth conferences last month in Belfast and in Derry at which 17 to 25-year-olds outlined the sort of future that they hoped for. They were very clear about what they wanted. We owe it to those young people of the region to give them the best possible legacy. They and the community at large know the importance of strengthening the economy, protecting the environment, caring for the vulnerable sections of our community, tackling disadvantage and providing the basis for sustainable communities. We need to reassure them that we are determined to plan for the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The views of everyone, especially those of young people and of people in the voluntary and community sectors, including the rural community, have been a major influence on our thinking. The degree of public debate and the responses that we have received will give members of the Committee an idea of people's desire to be part of the process. It has never been more evident that Northern Ireland stands on the edge of a whole new world and that the people have a strong desire to move forward. I am therefore reassured that our approach has been directed towards securing consensus.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not think that I shall be breaching any confidences if I now give the Committee a flavour of the reaction to the discussion paper. The issues that concern people include the integration of public services, with measurable targets and adequate resources based on a partnership approach; social cohesion, valuing people and the role of women; good public transport; achieving the right balances within the region and equitable distribution of growth between rural and urban areas; the reuse of urban land; the revival of towns and sustaining rural communities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have also been conscious of the need to ensure that there is enough land for house building in the years ahead. The projections suggest that as many as 200,000 new households may be required in the next 25 years. We cannot extend into green-field sites as we have done in the past. Since 1951 we have urbanised about 100,000 acres—that is, 160 square miles—of land that has been permanently lost as countryside. Most of that is in the river valleys, where the best agricultural land is located, and we have a lower percentage of good agricultural land than does England. We are not as land rich as we might think. We must therefore conserve this diminishing resource for future generations, which means that house builders must make greater reuse of urban sites. That will help to renew our towns, but we must not build on every site there either. We must retain the best of our built heritage and open spaces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Many members of the Committee will have noticed that the regional strategy was among the issues that featured in the rights, safeguards and equality of opportunity section of the Good Friday agreement. That agreement also reinforces the commitment to
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
partnership and equality. The Good Friday agreement suggested that the regional strategy was a matter for consideration in due course by an assembly. The outcome of the referendum on 22 May means that that is now possible. I suspect that the assembly will want to make it one of its priorities, although we will need to consider when it might best be done. There is, however, no doubt that the regional strategy offers an early opportunity to get involved in serious decision making about the things that matter to people—they matter all the more in a peaceful and stable environment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The project team has been working flat out in the past few weeks to convert all the informed opinion into a draft strategy, which we hope to publish either later this month or in early July. That will be followed by a further period of consultation—eight weeks in all. In that respect, today's Grand Committee is timely. Views that are expressed today can be fed immediately into the preparation of the draft strategy. We will subject the draft to public examination in the autumn. The independent membership of the panel has been established.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Following the public examination, the final strategy, which will be put in front of the New Assembly, will be available for consideration in early 1999. I look forward to the Committee's comments and questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In order to maintain conventions and courtesies, right hon. and hon. Members may remove their jackets if they wish. I should have said that at the beginning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Once again, I appeal to Committee members to keep questions brief. That way, I hope that we shall be able to take as many questions as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When I hear of a 25-year strategy, I immediately think back to the long-term strategy on the new city of Craigavon and the disaster that it eventually turned into, not least because it was not carried through from one form of Northern Ireland government to another. What guarantee can the Minister give that a strategy of this length will be carried through and assiduously pursued to a successful conclusion?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult for any Government to give a firm guarantee that certain things will happen as far ahead as 25 years from now. The Government are beginning a process to which we are committed, and I hope that the New Assembly will be equally committed to taking it forward. Assuming that the New Assembly will be in the driving seat from some time early next year, it will be up to it and local politicians to work out how best to take the strategy forward in the future.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister assume that considerable modification will be possible over the 25 years?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0704">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This is a framework. It is not and was not intended to be, a detailed planning document. It would be ill advised to suggest that a framework devised in 1998 will be embedded in concrete over a long period. We must be flexible. This framework will provide the broad context in which Northern Ireland can move forward. People in Northern Ireland, whether district councillors, voluntary groups or others, were enthusiastic and committed to the strategy. It will work if that high level of commitment among the people is maintained, and I am reasonably optimistic that that will be the case.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hull, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My noble Friend is to be congratulated on the concept of having a rolling programme for a regional strategy. That is of the utmost importance; people see how matters are developing and fresh ideas can be continuously fed in as situations change. However, he should be aware that part of the strategy—certainly as regards the area west of the Bann—is viewed with great suspicion. There is a feeling in many towns and councils on the border that the rural areas have been neglected. That opinion is reflected in all political parties and all shades of public opinion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Is my noble Friend aware that the proposals for transport to the west are still very poor indeed? I hope that we shall return to that matter in the debate. It is a subject of great concern to people in the west and in Northern Ireland's second city who feel that their interests do not receive the Government's full attention. They believe that there has been too much concentration on the eastern seaboard. The decision is surprising in view of the increasing population to the west of the Bann, in contrast to what is happening in other, similar countries.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly conscious of the views expressed by councils and by people west of the Bann about the difference in emphasis between the area west of the Bann and the eastern part of Northern Ireland, and the balance that must be struck. Indeed, several district councils to the west of the Bann made representations to the Government about correcting that balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Shaping our Future" is a discussion paper; it was intended to provoke debate and argument and to highlight the issues. In so far as people are responding, even if they are critical about the original balance in the discussion paper, it is a sign that the process is working. We are taking note of the views and comments about getting the balance right between the eastern and western parts of Northern Ireland. I hope that those concerns will be well reflected and expressed when the later documents are published.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: In what has been called the age of the spirit, the Committee will understand why I welcome young men who dream dreams and old men who see visions. I also welcome the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Let us consider the practical detail. Reference was made to adequate resources. Has anyone done any costing? What may be adequate resources for some, may be inadequate for others. It is important, as Parliament has to grant supply, that we should know what is involved.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An issue that makes me anxious about the regional strategy, especially with the appearance of the Atlantic arc on the map, is that there seems to be no link from west to east across England. The northern part of the nation and Northern Ireland might use proper transport facilities to get into the northern European markets with greater ease, rather than sending all the traffic to the southern ports.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Minister share my concern about integrated transport? I declare an interest: as a student I worked for three years in the office of a passenger manager with the old Ulster transport authority. One of my anxieties then, and now, is that road transport people will be in charge of the integrated transport policy, to the detriment of rail. I shall return to that subject later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My final question might be worth considering when we discuss integrated transport. Has any consideration been given to a bridge or a chunnel across the English channel linking Northern Ireland and Scotland? It would improve the entire transport facility, and thus our exports.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman raises three issues. First, on resources, the strategy is intended to influence priorities and spending plans over a long period. At this state, it would be unrealistic to link the strategy to resources. Clearly, as matters are worked out in the future, there may be resource implications, or it may be a matter of reordering resources from the present spending patterns to meet the wishes of local people, as may happen when "Shaping our Future" moves into the next stage.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman's second point was about the integration of road and rail transport. As everyone knows, there is a limited rail network in Northern Ireland, but one or two proposals are being considered—the Antrim-Bleach Green connection, for example. The Enterprise service between Belfast and Dublin is one of the most successful railway services in the world, and it is attracting increasing numbers of passengers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not want to say that the emphasis is on road transport alone, as I hope that the Government will encourage people to use public transport more. However, in many parts of Northern Ireland people who have to use public transport depend on an efficient bus service. Our transport policies must therefore be based on maintaining the railway network and achieving some improvements to it, and on improving bus services. Indeed, some time ago the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the provision of additional money for rural public transport. We are considering how that money can best be used in the more far-flung rural areas of Northern Ireland.

	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
The hon. Gentleman's third point concerned possible plans for a bridge or tunnel between Northern Ireland and Scotland. I must tell him that I know no more than what I have read in the newspapers.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I also have a question about public transport, in which I know that the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) is interested too. The Select Committee on Transport carried out a study on regional airports. We found that the air link was one of the most significant forms of transport out of Northern Ireland. However, we need regular slots into Heathrow and Gatwick because people who fly from Belfast to London must be able to change to long-haul, international flights. That air link with cities and towns around the world is essential for the extension of Northern Ireland's economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If the Minister is able to influence the strategy developed under the transport review, I hope that he will try to ensure that provision is made for links from Northern Ireland's regional airports to the hub airports of south-east England. The Select Committee report on regional airports will emphasise the need for such air links from Belfast, which will contribute to the quality of life in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am certainly sympathetic to that point, but the question of links to other parts of the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe are essentially commercial decisions for the airlines using airports in Belfast and elsewhere in Northern Ireland. I note that, in the past two or three days, Sabena has opened a direct flight from Belfast to Brussels. That will be helpful. The Government clearly wish to encourage airlines to increase the number and frequency of services to a greater range of destinations, but the commercial operators must make the final decision about each route.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I certainly welcome the development of a planning and transport strategy for Northern Ireland. We have hoped for that for a number of years.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
However, will the Minister say what will be done to rectify the bad planning decisions that have been taken already? Such decisions include the siting of industries on valuable agricultural ground in the countryside. The roads to those industrial sites make life difficult for farmers trying to farm in those areas. The other example is that of putting waste disposal areas in residential areas of villages. Unfortunately, those decisions have already been taken. What attention will be paid to rectifying them? When will the new funding that we have been promised for the A26, the Toome bypass, the Larne line and the Westlink be made available? The different parts of the Department of the Environment will be anxious to know.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman asks about bad planning decisions in the past, but the Government have no statutory powers to deal with them. All that I
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
can say is that there should be persuasive reminders to us to pay more attention to planning decisions in the future than has been done in the past. Sometimes, I have looked at an appalling building in Northern Ireland and said, "Goodness gracious me, who allowed that one to go up?" It was usually put up before the time of the officials with me, so everything is lost in history. Bad planning decisions have been made, and we can wander round Northern Ireland and see the results. All that we can do is learn the lesson from bad planning decisions and do better in the future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the new roads schemes that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has announced in the past few weeks. My Department is busily working on them. Some require land acquisition, which takes a little time, unfortunately. We also have to put out the contracts. We have to go through a process, but we are trying to determine which schemes can be implemented most quickly so that we lose no time in moving forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I noted the reference to the Toome bypass, and I am well aware of the concern about it. I have been actively engaged in getting something done about it for a long time, so I particularly welcome my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's announcement that money will be available for it. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are doing everything possible to get on with the schemes as quickly as we can.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Ms Sandra Osborne 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Ayr)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the minister agree that an economic development strategy has to be coupled with a social strategy? That means that resources need to be targeted to the areas of greatest need. How does he envisage that happening in Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Government's overall policy puts particular emphasis on the areas of greatest social need. That thread runs through not only our economic policies, but our housing policies and many other of our policies. Some of those are directly my responsibility and some are the responsibility of my ministerial colleagues. The answer to my hon. Friend's question is yes, we are targeting areas of social need. Clearly, it is a challenge to be effective. There are difficulties in the more disadvantaged areas, and a range of policies needs to be applied to deal with them. We can try to direct inward investment from, say, the United States, towards areas with the highest unemployment, but we cannot insist that it goes to them. Jobs are jobs, and any increase in inward investment is helpful. We try to steer investment in the direction of areas where it can most help to deal with unemployment.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that, as part of the planning strategy, the Government have identified four main towns as having high development potential. Listed among them is Lisburn, which is the main town in my constituency. One of the key objectives in developing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0706">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
those main towns is the provision of additional housing. That conflicts with the recently published Lisburn area plan, which Lisburn borough council has rejected because it does not make adequate provision for housing in the Lisburn borough. I wonder to what extent there is a conflict between the ongoing area plans that are currently being drawn up and the regional strategy. The one identified Lisburn as a major development area, while in my opinion and in the opinion of Lisburn borough council, the other proposes a substantial under-provision of housing development in the area for the next five to 10 years. The Minister and his Department will need to address that apparent conflict between the Lisburn area plan and the regional strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Secondly, it appears that the proposals and the way in which the document identifies high, medium and low growth areas have significant implications for the delivery of local government services in Northern Ireland. To what extent have the Minster and his Department considered the impact on the organisation and structure of local government in Northern Ireland of pursuing the regional strategy objectives? Does his Department have any plans to restructure local government in Northern Ireland?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I understand that the Lisburn area plan will be subject to a public inquiry later this year, so there will be adequate opportunity for all local people to say what they think was the matter with the plan as originally published.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree that there may be difficulties in the relationship between an individual area plan and the broad scheme outlined in "Shaping our Future" the assessments of the development potential of Northern Ireland's various towns and cities look 25 years ahead. Clearly, the area plan will reflect the greater detail and will thus give local people the opportunity to be specific about how they see their area moving forward. It is difficult for me to be more precise at this stage because neither the regional strategy nor the area plan is the final version; both are part of an ongoing process. In an ideal world, the area plan should be informed by the broad thrust of "Shaping our Future". There ought to be a link-though not a rigid one-between the two, and each should inform the other. I hope that that is how it will work out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We have said all along that any changes in the powers and possibly the structure of local government must be a matter for the new administration, which will take over next year. It is important that the Government do not seek to pre-empt that process. I can honestly say that we have no proposals. Obviously, I hold personal views, but it is not appropriate to express them at this stage. It is up to local politicians to work out how local government in Northern Ireland might best move forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is absolutely clear is that district councils will
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
have an important contribution to make to the process, whatever changes take place in their structure and powers. Even with their current structure and powers they have an important part to play, which is why we went out of our way to ensure that we tapped their views and experience. That goes for the future of local government as a whole. It is up to the New Assembly to decide how important it is to consider local government and how quickly it can make any changes that it wants to.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister emphasised, as does the document, the identified need for more than 200,000 new households over the next 20 years. Does he agree that it is most likely that the private sector will fund the vast majority of those new homes? Is he aware that the restricted release of land for housing development is creating considerable competition between developers? Ultimately young couples buying their first homes are having to pay outrageous prices. I know of sites making between £35,000 and £50,000 before a brick has been laid. Would not an earlier release of land help to bring prices down to more reasonable levels?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an additional impact on the farming community. Those who realise exorbitant sums for housing development land reinvest that money in land, forcing up the price for agricultural land. As a result, smaller farmers find it very difficult to enlarge their holdings and maintain viability. I direct the Minister's attention to the Carrickfergus area, where industrial development is inhibited by the delay to improvements to the A2 to Belfast. The failure to provide the proper infrastructure in that area is affecting housing development and needs urgent attention.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes several points. I agree that the present trend is that new house building will be done more by the private sector than the public sector. However, although the hon. Gentleman is right in what he says, the public sector has an important role in providing additional housing, through the Housing Executive and the housing associations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that there is a land shortage. My Department has examined the problem and sought to identify possible sites for development. We stick by our opinion that it is important to look for as many brownfield sites as possible, as we do not want to encroach on the countryside and make more mistakes that will be subject of future criticism. The task is difficult and one way to resolve it is to involve people in Northern Ireland in helping to identify where developments should take place. We must get public opinion to realise the difficulty of finding enough land for housing, and we need a sensible process for finding appropriate land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If a lot of land were available, prices would not have gone up as much as they have. The hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) talked about releasing
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0707">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
land. The Government have considered all the assets that we own, and we intend to dispose of what we do not need. However, the Government do not have enormous chunks of land to release in the way that the hon. Gentleman described. This is a commercial activity, and the housebuilding industry has to look for sites. We want to be helpful, subject to sensible planning constraints, but the industry has to look for land.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that there is a difficulty for farmers—there are many, but that is not the subject of this debate. I am well aware that farmers in Northern Ireland are going through a difficult time, and that is compounded by high prices and the problems encountered in acquiring more land to expand farms. Again, these are commercial decisions: they are not ones in which Government can sensibly or obviously intervene.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I begin by welcoming Lord Dubs to the Committee, and I hope to see him on many future occasions. I also welcome the document "Shaping our Future", which we have not had the opportunity before to discuss in Committee. It is well written and it covers most of the salient features. I cannot claim any input to its composition, but I did contribute to some of the earlier documents that I am pleased to see that it incorporates.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Given that the programme requires a draft regional strategy framework to be published this month, would not it have been better to hold this debate a little earlier? That would have give us more time to make an input to the final draft. Will the draft regional framework be published this month, as envisaged in "Shaping our Future"?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise several small points. The regional plan also gives a framework for the area plans. One of the problems in Northern Ireland over a number of years has been that the constraints on manpower in The Planning Service have caused area plans to fall behind. It has been suggested that future area plans should be formulated on a regional basis, rather than by district council, by amalgamating some district councils. Has any further thought been given to that? It would be a more effective way of utilising The Planning Service's resources.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the Treasury's announcement about the new road schemes. However, has it not jumped the gun somewhat? We are debating a new regional transport structure for Northern Ireland, but the Government have already decided which key roads should be built using the new money that has become available. Other priorities for investment in new roads may arise from the consultation process with the community and with district councils. The Government have announced three new road projects in advance of the findings of that consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document envisages the creation of 200,000 new households over a period of 20 years. There is some dispute as to the accuracy of that figure. Will the
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
Minister tell us if any additional thinking has gone into determining whether the figure is in the realms of probability or an extrapolation that has been dreamt up by a Queen's university boffin? The number of household creations is key to the allocation of housing to specific regions. The document contains a chapter, which is illuminated by a map, about major development towns and towns that are regarded as having less potential for growth. Will each of those major and medium growth centres be given an allocation of housing under the regional framework in the context of the area plan? Will regional allocation occur on the basis of the high, medium and low-growth centre designations?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
An important concept that was being developed by The Planning Service just before I left was that of improving the design of housing estates. That sprang from concerns about the quality of some of the estates that have been built in recent years. Certain parts of Belfast were singled out for particular criticism. The service developed a method of setting the standards that builders should achieve in the design and layout of housing estates. That is mentioned briefly in the document, but I should like to see it covered more extensively in future documents. Will the Minister update us on the progress that has been made in improving the design and quality of housing?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document refers to those towns that are seen as having potential for large-scale or medium-scale strategic development. The town of Ballyclare is marked on the map as a medium-scale development point, but it is relegated in the text to the lower-scale division. Is that a printing error on the map, or has Ballyclare's status changed in the interim?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister mentioned the Antrim to Bleach Green railway line. Will he tell when that important project is likely to be completed? The line provides a link, through Ballyclare, to Antrim. Antrim is designated as a major growth point and Ballyclare as medium growth point. That was a sensible decision. The Antrim-Bleach Green railway line, with new stations, should provide a corridor for substantial new development, especially for people who wish to commute into Belfast by rail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman has asked many questions. I thank him for his remarks about the document, and for starting a process that I was very happy to take over and to push forward as fast as possible. He deserves credit for responding to the Select Committee report and for initiating the process under discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
He asked a number of specific questions, to which I shall try to do justice. Regarding further publications in relation to the regional strategic framework, the Government will allow enough time to assess today's contributions. We are not likely to publish until next month, which should give us enough time to take the debate into account. No hon. member should feel that time is not being spent to best advantage, or that the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0708">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
debate will not influence the way in which we more forward.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am aware that the area plans have been falling behind due to lack of resources in The Planning Service. When the regional strategic framework discussions end, some staff working on the process will be released, and will go back to working on area plans. We are continually reviewing those plans to see how we can keep them as up to date as possible. I am aware that many local councils are concerned about working with plans that are sometimes not up to date.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Usually, councils like to have their own plans. In relation to at least one proposal, however, we are developing a plan for two councils together. We would be very interested in views about the possibility of moving towards sub-regional plans rather than specific area plans linked to individual local authorities. Our task would be made simpler, or at least more straightforward, and we could move on. The development of so many individual plans takes a great deal of time, especially as some require lengthy consultation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Regarding the road proposals, most of the schemes announced by the Chancellor do not concern new roads, but improvements to existing roads, bypasses, roundabouts, dualling and so on. They are carried out partly to deal with blockages, and partly on road safety grounds. None of our decisions pre-empt the shape of our future process. We are responding to a lot of pressure and concern in many parts of Northern Ireland about the road schemes, which are long overdue. I hope that we can introduce them as soon as possible.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Minister is not able to give way during answers to questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We have been working on a number of well-known road priorities. The Belfast to Dublin route has long been an issue. The road from Belfast to Derry city through Toome is another priority, as are the roads from Belfast to Larne and to Ballymena. Some schemes concerning specific roads have long been understood to be priorities. We are not contradicting the outcome by announcing the decisions. The people of Northern Ireland would take rather harshly any suggestion that we should delay moving ahead with those schemes. The pressure is in the other direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Mention was made of the 200,000 new households likely to be needed by 2025. That is a planning estimate: it is not set in stone. We need a figure to work with so that we and the building industry can seek land. A context and planning assumption is needed to move forward. Further consultation will be necessary to decide broadly how the planning estimates can be allocated to each area. That still has to
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
be decided as part of a consultation process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Newer houses built by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive seem to me to be well designed. I speak as a lay person, but I think that the quality of the design is good. Houses built earlier may have been complained about. The Government have placed much emphasis on improving the quality of design of all housing that is built in Northern Ireland. We are discussing with developers how to raise standards. Others, such as architects, are also anxious to raise standards, and I recently presented awards for good-quality designs. Such projects alert everyone in the industry—designers, architects, planners and so on—to the need for improved designs, and I am well aware of that need.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The growth potential in Ballyclare was mentioned. The scale of growth still has be decided. The document in question is a preliminary paper; we shall reflect on it and take note of what the hon. Gentleman said.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>	<i>rose</i>—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. We are approaching the time when we should be moving to the main debate. Two hon. Members who have not yet asked questions have told me that they wish to do so, and an hon. Member wishes to ask a supplementary question. I sense that the Committee welcomes the presence of the Minister, and I propose to allow questions to continue. Once they have been asked, I shall move to the main debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Norman A. Godman 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I apologise for my late arrival in the Committee, which was due to reasons outwith my control.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister spoke about the need to improve housing standards. I take it that he was talking not just about the design of houses. Chapter 4, page 7 of the document—entitled "Public Voices"—discusses the role played by the voluntary sector. I point out that several representatives of voluntary organisations have complained to me about the failure of the Minister's Department to release funds for the domestic energy efficiency programme, despite Ministers' promises some time ago. I was told by voluntary organisations' representatives that the money has been held up in the Northern Ireland Office. Will the Minister please sort out the problem and write to me, if he cannot reply now?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. I shall look into the matter and reply to him in writing. I am not on top of the details, but I know that there was some difficulty about the matter. I shall look into it and reply to the hon. Gentleman in writing if he is happy with that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Like other Members, I welcome the document. It is difficult to predict what will happen in 25 years, but it is good to have thought about the issue, to have anticipated the

	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
problems and to have made plans for infrastructure. For those reasons, it is a good document, which can be adapted to suit changing contingencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I represent one of the areas that has been awarded funds for infrastructure. I welcome the announcement that £87 million will be spent on roads, especially the road in my constituency from Ballygawley to Londonderry. Many of the schemes have been in the pipeline for some time and many will not be undertaken for some time because of the nature of the design. Can the Minister assure me that priority will be given to the Ballygawley to Londonderry road? Can he assure me, too, that the money that has been promised is additional money that will not be lost in subsequent years? We in the west have been deprived because of changing circumstances: agencies are centralising, boards are contracting, jobs are being centralised and staff are being taken away from the west. That is a big problem for the west of the Province, especially my constituency. Will the Minister take what I have described into consideration when the plan is implemented?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Certainly, I want my Department to get on with all the road schemes that have been announced as quickly as possible. But as I said earlier, some will take longer because of land acquisition and other details, which are understood. It may be the most sensible thing to give priority to those schemes on the list which can be done first because there are fewer problems. I cannot give the hon. Gentleman an undertaking about the priority; obviously, all the schemes announced by the Chancellor are important and I want them to progress. However, I want to make progress on behalf of all Northern Ireland, so I will move ahead with a scheme almost immediately when possible. We will work on the others at the same time. Yes, all the money in the Chancellor's announcement was additional money.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am well aware of concerns about the movement to concentrate employment in the west, rather than the east. I do not want that to be the future pattern. The Government want to ensure that there is even economic development and that our services and Departments are spread across Northern Ireland, not all moved to Belfast. There are difficulties. If we can save a lot of taxpayer's money by concentrating a service, we cannot easily neglect the need to make such savings. On the other hand, I am well aware of the difficult employment situation, and the Government want to improve it. I hope that the "Shaping our Future" process will reflect the concerns that the hon. Gentleman expressed.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister consider two issues that impact on local government? He mentioned waste management strategy, and he knows that it will be one of the hot potatoes over the next 25 years. How much waste—particularly domestic waste—will we burn, recycle and bury? As he knows, we are running out of holes in the ground. We all know that there is no
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
easy answer, but some people behave as if there were.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue concerns the voluntary and community sectors, on which the Minister dwelt to some extent. My experience of those sectors is that, although they are usually enthusiastic and perform valuable functions, they tend to focus narrowly on particular issues and small areas. Local government—the elected bodies—have to take a much broader view of the needs of the whole community.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
How will the Minister balance the two sectors? Would not it be better for local government to do much of the work that the voluntary and community sector currently does because they can take the broader view and have the expertise and staff to carry projects into effect? I am not convinced that the transfer of spending from local government to the voluntary sector has been entirely wise or that all the money has been well spent.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Lord Dubs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Those are two difficult and important questions. I hope shortly to publish for consultation a waste strategy for Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentlemen's question is a key one, which the document will seek to answer. Rather than anticipate what the document will contain, it would be better to wait until it is published. We shall then have a chance to discuss and consider it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the point that we do not want to resort to landfill unless we have to. There is a hierachy of options for the disposal of waste, including producing less waste, and recycling. The document will deal with all those options. It will impose significant additional responsibilities on business and households. We hope to have their co-operation so that we can have a more effective waste strategy that is more sensitive to local concerns about landfill sites. That does not mean that we can stop using all landfill sites; it does mean that we want to reduce the amount of waste that goes into them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I feel that I have been dealing with the hon. Gentleman's second point about the balance between the voluntary sector and local government for the past 25 years. Not all voluntary organisations have a narrow focus, although some do because they are set up to have one. Some, however, have a wide focus. What is encouraging about Northern Ireland is that there is a vibrant voluntary and community sector—dare I say that it is more vibrant than in some other parts of the UK? Voluntary and community organisations and local government have their part to play. I would prefer there to be no conflict between the two, and that each should take account of the other's responsibilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local councils are elected and there is a different process of accountability for an elected councillor and a voluntary organisation. That is at the heart of the hon. Gentleman's question. I should not like to stifle one sector or the other. I should like to do everything I can to encourage them to co-operate. Indeed, one sees signs of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0710">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
such co-operation in some of the local, positive partnerships between elected councillors, the voluntary and community sector, employers and trade unions. Of course, the peace and reconciliation money has boosted the process. In conclusion, I want those two sectors to co-operate positively rather than to see themselves in competition.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On behalf of the Committee, I thank the Minister for making a statement and answering questions this morning. It is not unheard of for a Minister from another place to attend a Commons Committee, but it is unusual and I know that Committee members are grateful to him for so doing.

Before I call the Minister of State to move the motion for a regional strategic framework for Northern Ireland, I again remind right hon. and hon. Members that the debate can continue only until one o'clock. While I have no power to impose time limits on speeches, it is abundantly plain that I will be able to call as many speakers as possible if speeches are kept commendably brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.36 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of a regional strategic framework for Northern Ireland, as set out in the discussion paper 	<i>Shaping our Future.</i></p></blockquote>
Bearing in mind your points about brevity, Mr. Gale, and the fact that my noble Friend opened the debate with a comprehensive statement, I shall, with the permission of Committee members, confine my remarks to a closing speech in which I can respond to the various points that they may raise.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.37 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was the most commendably brief opening statement I have ever heard. Would that the Minister were always so brief, but that is unlikely.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The document is an important part of the on-going debate on how Northern Ireland should develop over the next few years. The further into that we get, the hazier the more obscure the outcome becomes. I listened with great interest to the noble Lord's speech and the questions that were put to him. There is a lot of food for thought in what has been said hitherto. I want to raise three issues: transport strategy—particularly with regard to roads—housing development and environmental protection. I shall deal with them in reverse order.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The term "environmental protection" covers a multitude of sins and problems. The problem that concerns most of us is the level of pollution. Fortunately, Northern Ireland has much less pollution than many other parts of the United Kingdom. That is a good place from which to start, because at least we
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
do not have to overcome the massive problems that exist elsewhere. However, we must ensure not only that the existing problem does not grow, but that it is reduced.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As the Minister knows, much of our pollution problem stems from the activities of the Department of the Environment and its failure over many years to provide proper sewage treatment throughout Northern Ireland, not least along its coast. Of course, that impinges directly on the tourist industry, which requires clean beaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is an enormous problem. The previous Administration hoped to deal with it through the private finance initiative, but that seems to have come to a shuddering halt. I was never much enamoured of it anyway, because I did not think that the Government should be paying on the never-never. I am not sure that the PFI, despite its apparent immediate attractions, is a runner where many of these matters are concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What strategy do the Government have for dealing with the sewage problem, especially on the north coast? How will they reduce the discharge of, in some cases, raw or minimally treated sewage into the sea? Where is the money to come from? What time scale and cost are we looking at before the problem is eliminated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second problem is farm pollution. Nowadays, that consists mainly of silage effluents and the enormous amount of pig and cattle slurry that has to be disposed of. I hope that the Minister will pay keen attention to the constant and major problem of pollution leakage from farms. The leakage of silage into rivers every summer has disastrous consequences for fish. In addition, the pesticides and organophosphate dips used in farming cause problems that must be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have often wondered why half a dozen PhD students could not be funded in an attempt to find an easy way to deal with the problem of silage effluent. It is the most serious farm pollution problem and it must be resolved. Many tourists come to Northern Ireland because of its fresh, clean image, but the tourist industry is not helped by the stench of sewage on our beaches.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I hope that something will be done to protect the natural beauty of Northern Ireland's environment, and that the planning service will be reviewed. I get a lot of mail about windfarms, for example, as people question the efficiency of those structures in producing electricity. Is not it time to take a hard and critical look at the that method of providing sustainable, renewable energy? More energy than is produced by windfarms might be saved by building energy-efficient dwellings, and greater use could be made of the admittedly limited possibilities offered by solar energy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We face enormous difficulties with housing. The Minister is aware that building 200,000 houses will raise the total number by roughly one third. People
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0711">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
demand higher standards of space and efficiency in their housing and living conditions. As many of the new houses will have to cater for smaller household units, will smaller, more high-density housing be appropriate?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Perhaps we should examine the concept of how people want to live, especially in urban settings. The lifestyle of the working population is more mobile in every respect than formerly. We must give serious consideration to improving the design of the houses to be built as well as to where they will be sited.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We must also examine the possibility of extending the natural gas pipeline as far and as fast as we can to the west. The Ballymena-Ballymoney-Coleraine-Limavady line to Londonderry covers a very important area. There is great potential for expansion if the pipeline is taken that way.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some efforts have been made to deal with the problem of housing in the countryside and I commend the previous Government for that. However, we have not come to the end of that tale: all sorts of difficulties remain that must be subject to careful examination. A large proportion of our population wants to live in the countryside, but when people get there—especially those from an urban setting—they find that it is not as pleasant or simple as they imagined. In fact, many do not want to live in the countryside, but at the seaside. As a result, there has been an amazing expansion of seaside towns. I draw the Minister's attention especially to places such as Portstewart and Portrush, and to the small village of Portballintrae, where perhaps at least a third or a half of dwellings are holiday homes or second homes. The village is like a ghost town for much of the year. That is astonishing and unacceptable, and it is ruinous to local residents and to the fabric of the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am not sure how that problem can be combated, or whether it can be combated in any reasonable way, but I hope that hon. Members will consider it carefully. The sheer numbers of people moving into Portballintrae and into other such areas in my constituency ruin that which draws them there in the first place. It is hard to get that problem across to people, but it is a fact of life. I hope that the Minister will carefully consider plans for the long-term future of those seaside villages as well as for inland areas with similar problems. The Government should also consider housing in the rural community and how that should be dealt with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The main point that troubles me is transport—I shall stick to two items on today's agenda—and the development of the transport infrastructure. We are trying to achieve the movement of goods on the one hand and of people on the other. Whether we like it or not, most goods moved out of, into and across Northern Ireland are moved by road. People will simply not depart from the door-to-door facility of roads.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The expansion of rail traffic has been very small,
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
totally unlike that in Great Britain as a whole. Opportunities for expansion on this side of the Irish sea are much greater. I hope that much more heavy, long-distance traffic will transfer to rail. That will not be cheap or easy, but I think that it can be done, although not to the same extent as in the rest of Britain. While that point can easily be accepted, the transportation of people is much more difficult, especially on public transport. Much can be done in the large conurbation of Belfast and in its environs within a 20-mile radius. Beyond that area, however, people will try to use their cars whenever possible. Car travel is much more flexible, takes people from A to B more easily and is more convenient for everyone concerned.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Where mass public transport can be introduced, it will apply to people who commute to work, and who go straight in and straight out. Such travel should be facilitated when possible. It is feasible in Antrim, Lisburn and across to the Ards peninsula. Beyond that, however, with the possible exception of larger towns in the north-west triangle, such as Ballymena, Coleraine and Londonderry, public transport as a means of regularly moving people is a non-starter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That leaves the problem of people in rural areas who do not have access to a car and who need a means of getting to town. I am thinking especially of women who wish to go shopping and so on. That is a horrendous problem, for which there is no cheap solution. I hope that the Government understand that. The problem is not confined to Northern Ireland, but we should keep it in mind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that the Department of the Environment should consider the vast areas that have been acquired across Northern Ireland for major roundabouts, and which are simply used for ongoing maintenance? Parts of such areas could be used as safe, secure places for people to park cars. That might encourage more multiple use and reduce the number of cars on our roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting statement. Some of them seem to be used as parking sites on a small scale at the moment, so perhaps an expansion of that would be welcome. In rural areas cars are Hobson's choice—one uses a car or one does not go. The view of my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) may come into play in that respect.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The map on page 78 of the document shows the major routes. I shall deal with the north and west of the Province because that is the area I know best. The Belfast to Londonderry route going north does not show Ballymoney or Limavady, but they are important towns on that route. Further west, the important north-south route via the Castledawson roundabout to Dungannon is not shown. The important hub town of Cookstown is not shown either. The roads are not bad in that area, but there is considerable scope for improvement. I hope that the Minister will carefully examine that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0712">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
Most astonishingly of all, Portrush and Portstewart are not shown on the Coleraine triangle area of the map. They are part of that increasingly urbanised area which needs major improvements to its roads and a rail link. The triangle needs not only better roads to Belfast, but also a better road connection straight through into Larne. The need to improve that stretch of road is paramount. It is the last major stretch of bad road on the road from the Coleraine triangle to Belfast and to the port of Larne. The Ballymena-Larne route also needs much improvement. The Minister should begin to prioritise the road requirements of the area. He should have a full discussion about the matter with the area's elected representatives on the council and in the House of Commons to decide what can be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Further to the west are the Limavady and Dungiven bypasses, which are both bottlenecks. Dungiven will become an even greater bottleneck when the Toome bypass is finished. The Toome bypass differs in reality from the proposals that were put forward a year or two ago—a complety new road is being built. My hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) and I should like to know exactly what that road will provide.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Chancellor's speech on 12 May provided money for four major schemes, including the West link improvement. Does that mean that a private finance initiative is no longer to be used for that improvement? Is it now to be undertaken using public money? I note that the Minister indicates his assent. The PFI concept has failed in that respect. Money is also to be provided for the Belfast-Larne road, the Toome bypass and the Antrim-Ballymena road that leads out to the north and west of the Province into the Coleraine triangle, Ballymoney and Limavady. That money is all welcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All that is being done is to extend the road network out of Belfast. Will the Minister indicate what he sees beyond those immediate road schemes? Is he going to improve matters for those who live further west? I have already mentioned the need for improvements on the north-south route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister provide time scales for the completion of the Limavady bypass, which is a priority in my constituency, the Dungiven bypass and the other projects that I have mentioned? Will he also ensure that improvements are made to the roads to Aldergrove airport? A rail link would also be helpful. It is Northern Ireland's main airport, and I believe that it will remain so no matter what happens elsewhere.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are the matters that I wished to raise. I hope that the Minister considers them carefully, because road infrastructure will be the key to the industrial development that we need. That applies not least to Coleraine, where it would impact on a university campus that is already a magnet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>11.55 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Hull, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to be brief so that colleagues can take part in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) wondered about the access of Northern Irish goods lorries to northern Europe. I could point out that the M62 is the key artery which ends up in the port of Hull, from where there are regular sailings to the low countries, the Baltic and north Germany. Perhaps we could talk later about what the hon. Gentleman can do to help us develop that facility in the better interests of Northern Ireland and the port of Hull. He will know that I led a delegation from Hull to Belfast and other areas pointing out the advantages of that route. There would, of course, be an additional advantage for the hon. Gentleman in the knowledge that every lorry travelling from Northern Ireland to Hull would be blessed by passing under the shadow of the finest equestrian statue anywhere in these islands of our late sovereign William III. That is something to commend the route.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My noble Friend spoke about the paucity of rail transport in Northern Ireland. The question of coordination between road and rail traffic arose throughout the discussions that I and my colleagues on committee C of the economic and social committee of the inter-parliamentary body had in Northern Ireland over the past two days. It was particularly pleasing to know that since the bus and rail services came under one board of directors, they seem to be far more efficient. Some 3,200 regular rail and bus timetables are now being met every week in Northern Ireland, which is a considerable achievement of bus and train co-ordination. Questions arise, but that is to be welcomed as an example to the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Such co-ordination would be completely ruined if there were any question of privatising road transport—bus services in particular—on the scale that we saw in the rest of the United Kingdom. There would almost automatically be a reduction in services and no possibility of cross-subsidisation between services, which would be to the detriment of people in Northern Ireland, particularly those in areas that are not served by railways. Although Northern Ireland prides itself on this issue, it is important to realise that many parts, particularly in the west, are not adequately served by bus services, even today. Some of the remoter villages have only one bus in a week. As the hon. Member for East Londonderry pointed out, that leads to greater reliance on the car, which brings me to the problem of Northern Ireland's road network. The problem is more acute in the west, where there is considerable population growth.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It has been suggested that, on the grounds of traffic volume, perhaps the west does not qualify for the amount of money that has been spent on roads in the east. However, the areas that arise most frequently on indices of poverty, deprivation and lack of opportunity
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0713">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>25</span>
are those which are not on the motorways or good dual carriageways. People in the west attach the utmost importance to communications maintaining their communities and building them into thriving and important areas.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A paragraph on page 86 of the discussion document is entitled "Consultation with the Rural Community" and states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The preparation of the regional strategic framework will facilitate an in-depth consideration of the strategic rural issues across Northern Ireland. The next phase of consultation will involve extensive participation of the rural community to consider the rural agenda at a regional level."</p></blockquote>
That statement is welcome, but the Government have a considerable amount of ground to regain in the consultation period. The consultation paper is supported by all shades of political opinion, from deepest orange to the most emerald green, with a bit of red thrown in between. However, I have before me a critique of the document prepared by the west rural region district councils of Cookstown, Dungannon, Fermanagh, Omagh and Strabane. Those councils share a common disappointment at the document and its presentation of the discussion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The council's critique has a measured tone. It states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The publication of the Discussion Paper has caused widespread dismay and anger among rural interests and people, not least those in the West rural Region comprising the Counties of Fermangh and Tyrone. Indeed it is as if the document had been prepared some thirty years ago, being more in keeping with the Matthew Plan than today's approach to regional planning and development."</p></blockquote>
The depth of feeling is illustrated when local authorities, with their civil servants and chief executives, talk about "widespread dismay and anger".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The critique also states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"The poverty of ideas about the future of rural areas is in marked contrast to the consideration given to urban areas".</p></blockquote>
A real sense of disappointment about the proposals is evident in people living west of the Bann. They are disappointed also about the roads programme proposals. Obviously, everyone welcomes what my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said, in his statement following the Good Friday agreement, about the money to be allocated to improve roads and infrastructure. That is spoken of as new money, as it is, in one sense, but the people of Northern Ireland will pay for those roads by passing money from one pocket to another. That money will come from the sale of the harbour commission and of associated land and harbour facilities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although we welcome the fact that the money did not go into the general Treasury coffers but was earmarked for Northern Ireland, nevertheless Northern Ireland money is to be used to pay for roads in Northern Ireland. It is a transfer of money from an asset sale. I do not want to take an historical analogy too far, but at the time of the famine Ireland had to finance its own relief measures, even though Northern Ireland was part of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
So much for being a United Kingdom and sharing all the responsibilities. Nevertheless, that asset is being sold to facilitate something else—the money is not really new. The privatisation of the harbour commission is being done against the wishes of the majority of people. When we were in Opposition, there was a three-line Whip and we voted against the privatisation of Belfast harbour. There we are—new Labour, new policies, but not really new money. I want to make two further points about the road system.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman will recall that all parties in Northern Ireland and the then Opposition voted against a change in the ownership of the trust port of Belfast. If there now are plans to change it, would not it be better for the decision to be left to the New Assembly?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. McNamara</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes. It has always been my belief that many of the issues that are decided for Northern Ireland would be better decided in a power-sharing assembly. In terms of the assets that are being sold off, it would have been better for money to come from general taxation as a demonstration of happiness with the situation rather than for an asset to be sold off.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make two further points. First, there is considerable unhappiness about the failure of successive Governments to raise the standards of the north-south Derry to Dublin road and the east-west Belfast to Derry road. People are unhappy because the weight of traffic is enormous for the roads. It is generated in the west of Ireland in Donegal and comes in through Enniskillen. It goes down to Dublin or across to Belfast. There needs to be adequate road surfaces.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
That brings me to my second point. When committee C made inquiries of Ministers and civil servants, the most surprising fact to be discovered was that not only the document before us but other documents and decisions relating to Northern Ireland and the Republic had been produced on an ad hoc basis. Whether we have an assembly or regional bodies, there are positive reasons for having regular, formalised, institutionalised discussions between Ministers of the two jurisdictions. I hope that they will come from the Dail Eireann and the New Assembly. Such discussions need to take place and to be seen to take place. It is important that decisions are not made about roads in Northern Ireland or the Republic without Ministers considering their impact. It is also important for there to be a Derry-Galway-Limerick-Tralee axis with a little spur off to Ballina to counterbalance the Belfast-Dublin axis.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Those are important issues for the wealth and happiness of the people not only of Northern Ireland but of Ireland as a whole. Everything is being integrated. The establishment of a regular body and thus proper consultation, which we lack at present, is of the utmost importance. I hope that that will be established in the New Assembly. If, lamentably, it fails, it should be the Government's priority to ensure
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0714">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>27</span>
that there are regular meetings in an institutionalised forum to discuss the matter. We must remember that those roads are European roads, earmarked by the European Community, going from the west of Ireland, taking goods through Belfast or Dublin across to Britain and down to the channel ports. Like the hon. Member for Belfast, South, I hope that more commercial traffic will come across to the Humber ports and to Hull.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The paper lacks a fundamental ingredient: LSD. We may have good intentions and the most noble plans, but without the financial resources to carry them out, they will fall by the wayside. There are indications that there will be cuts in the primary services of the Department of the Environment to provide moneys for this farsighted plan. I hope that after the general expenditure review more money will be available for its implementation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Of particular importance is the objective 1 status of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland for regional development in the European Community. That status will be lost, and the matter is likely to be spun out over the next six years. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said that special appeals should be made to the European Community for objective 1 status to last for much longer. The taoiseach expressed similar views in respect of the border counties. That will take some arguing with the Commission, given the pressures for money as a result of the enlargement of the European Community. This is of the utmost importance for one reason: the other regions that received extra money could take full advantage of it. In Northern Ireland and the border counties, however, internal unrest prevented the economy from being properly developed, especially in those communities along the border in Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo in the Republic and south Armagh, south Down, Tyrone, Fermanagh and parts of Derry. The lack of economic development has been due to the threat of terrorism from paramilitaries on both sides and because the economic hinterland in many places was cut off by road closures and the destruction of bridges. There was thus no economic interplay between communities on either side of the border to enable them to reap the benefit of the money, so opportunities were lost. That must be borne in mind when we argue for the extension of objective 1 status and its accompanying money in Northern Ireland and the border counties of the Republic.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thank the Minister and his Department for the excellent arrangements they made for the visit of committee C of the inter-parliamentary body to Northern Ireland, and ask them to convey to the representatives of the cross-border organisations, the councils and the public and private interests, our thanks for their courtesy and help to the Committee. I hope that we will publish a report expressing some of
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
the opinions expressed to us, especially the sense felt by those who live west of the Bann that a great opportunity has been lost in this document.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.15 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the opportunity to follow the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) and contribute to the debate. The hon. Gentleman agrees with me that adequate resources must be made available. Too often, we talk in generalities. We are in danger of moving into an age in which the principle of Robin Hood has been turned on its head. Instead of robbing the rich to look after the poor, in the modern world we tend to rob the poor to increase the riches of the rich.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have been worried about that for a long time, especially in regard to hospital management, where the number of low-paid workers is often reduced so that the salaries of well-paid managers can be increased. Before we embark on a particular strategy, we must ensure that we have counted the cost, so that people's aspirations are not built up only to be dashed.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To return to transport: I recognise the importance of the Belfast-Dublin line. As successive Ministers, including Lord Dubs who addressed the Committee today, will testify, for 14 years I have badgered them about the section of the line running through south Belfast. From my acquaintance with transport and the area, I know that humble people have had their homes and peace disturbed because those in authority did not understand that that line needed proper work rather than the patchwork quilt of repairs that has been the solution for so long.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Although completion of the line has been put back to the end of 1998, I welcome the fact that it will be completed. One of the busiest commuter lines, especially in the morning and evening, is that from Larne into Belfast. Every time an atrocity has destroyed carriages on the line through Portadown into Dublin, the commuters on the Larne line have suffered most. When that has been drawn to the attention of the rail authorities, they have sent the lovely answer to mothers worried about their children in overcrowded carriages that if they are not satisfied, their children should not travel at peak hours. Where is the sensibility in such replies from officials to those mothers? They are worried about their children, who have to travel to school in the rush hour. If terrorism has destroyed an aspect of life, one of our first priorities must be to restore that aspect, rather than penalise law-abiding citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In addition, sustainable development should have room for cycle paths, so that people can go back to using bicycles. The Department has been dilatory in that regard, partly because it is claimed that people are not interested. However, people are not interested in bicycles because they cannot be used with any degree of safety. That aspect has to be raised again and drawn to the Minister's attention.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0715">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
What is the definition of "accessibility". The discussion document refers to
	<br><blockquote><p>"improving accessibility for all the people in the Region to a full range of services, including education and health".</p></blockquote>
Admittedly, the document provides a qualification, which is visible on careful reading. It states that that improvement will occur "within the resources available", and refers to "employment opportunities".
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Are the Government aware that the Department of Health has recognised that the average patient is not as concerned about accessibility as about the provision of good facilities to enable people to obtain health care when they need it? When the concept of accessibility is used, a harsh reality must be faced. People in south Tyrone recognise that they will not have the access to local hospitals that they once had. When we speak of accessibility, we must face the fact that some people in the Down area no longer believe that they will have access to the services that they require. The presentation of Northern Ireland's strategic future should be clear, and should draw attention to the fact that the six golden hospitals are the accessible ones, no matter how far they are from people who believe that the distance is too great to travel.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Page 16 of the discussion document deals with the "perceived peripherality" of the region. I am happy that that concept is recognised. Frankly, we tend to minimise our possibilities. Regarding air traffic, I was reminded of a visit that I made many years ago with my hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim to Taiwan and Hong Kong. People there asked why they should invest in Northern Ireland. We reminded them that if they came, they would be as close to the west coast markets of the United States as they were in Hong Kong, and that they would also be closer to Europe and to Africa.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to emphasise the bonus points. The transport suggestions that have again arisen should be followed through. I accept the Minister's point about commercial viability—commercial guidance can often be given more emphasis than hitherto when people are prodded in our direction.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
People who come into the field of air transport in Northern Ireland have done very well. One of the main British service providers, British Airways, which was once a national airline, now seems to be an international airline, and keeps withdrawing slots from Northern Ireland. The point made ably by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) should be followed through, and a way forward must be found.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
To speak about the inevitability of a dysfunctional community would in the context in which I am speaking relate to a unionist and nationalist partnership not working properly. The tragedy is that dysfunctional communities have developed because the authorities have not dealt with people who impose their will on communities. I am thinking of part of my own constituency, where, over the years, people living
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
around the markets area have sought to move out because elements have been imposing their will, at times with some support from Government sources. I welcome some of the good work that has been done by voluntary and community groups and through partnership schemes, but the harsh reality is that much of the money that has been poured in has not been spent on sustainable development. As a result of the recent press, partnership schemes have begun to recognise that when the money ceases to come in, they will be left with nothing. They are now beginning to look forward to sustainable development.

Finally, following what my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) said, will the developments for the provision of energy from waste products in Belfast again be put on the long finger while further discussion on waste disposal takes place, or will we shortly be able to proceed with the erection of an energy plant in the dock area, which will allow us to provide energy from waste for the benefit of our people?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order.

<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is always a pleasure to listen to and follow the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth). He made passing reference to his frequent visits to Asia and other places; I remind the Committee that the hon. Gentleman is also an occasional visitor to Scotland, where he is highly regarded by some sections of the community. He is certainly highly respected in my constituency.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am grateful to my noble Friend the Minister from the other place for his courteous offer to write to me about concerns on the slowness of the distribution of the money promised from the domestic energy efficiency programme. The Minister of State, my hon. Friend. the member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram), made a statement eight or 10 weeks ago about that programme being given £5 million. As I said, I have heard allegations that the money was being held up in the Northern Ireland Office. I shall be interested to receive a written reply on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also thank my noble friend for the warm tribute that he paid to the voluntary sector and community organisations in Northern Ireland for their vital role in bringing people together. I am associated with the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary authorities, which I assure the Committee plays an important role.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Dare I remind my noble Friend of his invitation to
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0716">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
me to meet him to discuss concerns about the targeting of social needs policy? The promised meeting might be overtaken by the setting up of the New Assembly but who knows—it might happen.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
If I can catch his ear—someone seems to be rabbiting on to him—I have a couple of questions for the Minister who is on duty today. Pages 47 to 49 deal with ports and the report rightly says that Belfast and Lame have important passenger services, some of which are with Scottish ports. I am only sorry that those services do not go to Gourock, Greenock or even further up the Clyde, but stay down in Stranraer and Cairnryan. They are important and, as the document says on page 47, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of passengers travelling to Belfast from Scotland and elsewhere. That expansion will continue, particularly where Scotland and tourism are concerned. There is much tourist traffic between Scotland and Northern Ireland, and I would put money on its expanding. I hope that the Minister is confident that the facilities in Larne and Belfast will be able to cope with that projected increase.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister will not be able to answer today my next point about the Ballycastle-Campbeltown ferry service. What is the Department's position on it? A couple of Opposition Members fought like hell to get it established. I was recently in Campbeltown, but did not have the opportunity to hop on the ferry. It is an important link for tourist traffic. I wanted Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the service, but the then Secretary of State for Scotland, the delightful Mr. Michael Forsyth, chose another option. It is an important service that will increase in popularity. Perhaps the Minister can write to me about the number of passengers that service has carried since it started.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I promised to be brief and, unlike some, I try to stick to my promises. I want, therefore, to ask just a couple of questions about Northern Ireland fishing ports, which get sparse mention in the document. There is mention of the fishing ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie. Although the fishing industry is small, it is important to the fishing communities. We know in Scotland that those communities can provide a focus for tourism. My hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Ms Osborne) and I had the rare—some would say doubtful—privilege of being honorary presidents of the Clyde Fishermens Association. In some respects, it is closely akin to the associations in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give an assurance that, despite the requirements of the European Union's multi-annual guidance programme, the fishermen of Northern Ireland will be given every assistance to renew their fishing vessels? It is right and proper that we reduce the size of the European Union fishing fleet. I have said for 30 years or more that too many fishermen are chasing too few fish. I want the Spanish banned from our grounds, but that is me being ethocentric. It is
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
important for our small fishing communities that vessel owners are given every encouragement to renew their aging vessels. The same holds for Northern Ireland as for Scotland. Vessels, especially on the west coast, are becoming old. We need to replenish the small fleets. Will the Minister comment on the multi-annual guidance programme and its implications for fishing vessel owners? The European Union MAGP must be implemented in a way that allows for the replenishment of the small fleet.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.35 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, shall be brief, so that the Minister will have plenty of time to respond. It is the Opposition's job to oppose, but on this occasion, as a previous gamekeeper, I am finding it difficult to turn poacher, because I was involved in much of what has gone into the excellent document before the Committee today.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wish to raise a couple of points. I was aware that new road schemes, if not new roads, were being proposed in the programme. I do not question the choice of those schemes, as I know that they, and one or two others, have long been priority cases. However, we have not yet received the results of consultation on this document and on the draft regional framework that will follow. So to choose the schemes now seems to pre-empt the input from the community and district councils.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I believe that the road schemes chosen are eminently sensible. Certainly, I had Westlink in the private finance initiative programme. In the frame too were the A8 and the A26 to Ballymena. The Toomebridge bypass also featured highly. However, given the political circumstances in Northern Ireland and the move to an assembly, one cannot but wonder why it was decided to invest money in the roads programme now. Those more sceptical than I may consider that the decision had something to do with the agreement that has recently been approved in the referendum. I go no further than to say that it is somewhat strange that such big decisions were not left a little longer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister say what progress is being made on Goosegreen? What completion date does he consider likely?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman ask the Minister about the unadopted roads in the Province? Supposedly, a report on such roads has been completed, but we have not been able to read it.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will have heard that question, so there is no need for me to repeat it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 6 of the document deals with strategic regional challenges. I have already alluded to one of those challenges—the building of 200,000 additional households over the next 25 years. That is an important figure, as much of the associated regional planning—the numbers of houses needed and where
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0717">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
they should be built—is predicated on its accuracy. I recognise that we need a figure to work with, but I should like it to be more definitive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Chapter 6 also deals with the difficult problem of the settlement pattern in Northern Ireland. A late chapter addresses the rural planning strategy, and quotes from "The Planning Strategy for Rural Northern Ireland", published by the Department of the Environment in 1993. That document acknowledged that opposing pressures had to be accommodated in rural development. On page 34, "Shaping our Future" quotes it as follows:
	<br><blockquote><p>"the continued development of a dispersed settlement pattern is at odds with the need to reduce costs of providing services to the community and reliance on the car. These opposing pressures have to be balanced. It is apparent that, at present, there is a very strong desire within rural communities to support a dispersed settlement pattern and the Department's Strategy acknowledges this desire within normal planning constraints".</p></blockquote>
I am pleased that that passage has been reprinted from the 1993 document, and I hope that it is retained at the heart of future development in Northern Ireland when decisions are made about where the houses are to go. The settlement pattern in Northern Ireland is different from that in the rest of the United Kingdom, especially in England and Wales, with an emphasis on towns and villages; Northern Ireland has a dispersed settlement pattern. When I was a Minister one of the difficulties that The Planning Service had to deal with was the number of applications for single dwellings in the countryside. There is a much more relaxed approach to the matter in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the fact that the issue will be dealt with in the New Assembly as and when it is established. In future, local politicians will have to decide whether they will further relax the planning requirements for building in the countryside given the economic constraints of providing services to the dispersed settlements. When, for the first time, the local politicians in the New Assembly consider the issues I hope that they will face up to these difficult problems.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a passing reference on page 50 to a rail link to Belfast international airport. It is a vital issue and I hope that future documents will stress the importance of that rail link, as well as emphasising the upgrading of the road.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A whole chapter is devoted to sustainable development. The quality of water supply and sewerage schemes are among the matters discussed. It is not possible for 200,000 new houses to be build in Northern Ireland without massive pressure being put on both those services. Given the substantial cost of future schemes and the capital cost of the current programme, it is time for the people of Northern Ireland to ask where the money will come from for these expensive capital programmes. Hitherto, the money has come from public expenditure, but the programme is falling behind and the quality of the water in some of the key
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
bathing beaches in Northern Ireland needs to be tackled.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is time that the people of Northern Ireland considered water privatisation. Whatever one's political views on the matter, at the end of the day it is a major source of private capital with which to build major schemes. Such matters should be the subject of future documents, so that they can be discussed by politicians and by individuals in Northern Ireland who contribute to the consultation process.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.43 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to you, Mr Gale, and to members of the Committee for a useful and interesting debate on the future development of Northern Ireland in the next 25 years. The statement by my noble Friend Lord Dubs set out how people's quality of life in Northern Ireland will be deeply affected by the way in which they react to the report.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The report is an excellent springboard for policies that the New Assembly will deal with when it is elected in a few weeks' time. It is rooted in the Belfast city regional project; the Select Committee, valuably and wisely, recommend that it should be extended to whole of Northern Ireland. There has been significant consultation but I take note of hon. Members on both sides of the Committee who said that more and deeper consultation is needed among local authorities, voluntary groups, businesses, trade unions and other organisations in Northern Ireland that have an interest in the reports recommendations.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am responsible for financial matters, not for the environment, so whoever succeeds me next year in the New Assembly as Northern Ireland's Minister with responsibility for finance will have a tough time in deciding on the priorities that are highlighted by the document. One example of that is the urgent need for improvements to the transport system. We have heard much in the debate, and in the statement that preceded it, about the roads in different parts of Northern Ireland. Those transport needs will have to be balanced by future Ministers in the New Assembly against the demand for hospitals and schools and for all the other services that are provided by the £7 billion or £8 billion that is currently spent in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Members for East Londonderry and for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) referred to pollution. There are inadequacies to be addressed in Northern Ireland's water service and in the infrastructure of it sewerage system. That means that a great deal of money will have to be spent over the next quarter of a century. My noble Friend will shortly be involved in the publication of a paper on various ways of funding water and sewerage services. The decisions about that may soon be out of his and my hands, but we view the situation very seriously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was asked about further investment in transport. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred specifically to various road schemes. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0718">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire spoke about prioritising. Some of Northern Ireland's political parties, large councils and other bodies have noted that the selected schemes concentrate on the key strategic routes in Northern Ireland—Belfast to Larne, Belfast to Newry, Belfast to Ballymena, Belfast to Londonderry and Londonderry to Ballygawley. All those roads are strategically important. Other roads, such as those referred to by the hon. Member for East Londonderry and the unadopted roads that were mentioned by the hon. Member for East Antrim, are significant in terms of the development of communities, both rural and urban. My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North referred specifically to the west of Northern Ireland, which is in particular need of transport funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with the hon. Member for East Londonderry's comments about wind farms. Problems in that respect have caused concern in my constituency, which is mountainous, for some years. I also agree with him about types of housing. We need to look carefully in the next quarter of a century at house sizes as well as where houses are built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North was right to comment on the important links between the great city of Hull and Northern Ireland. His specific point related to the western part of Northern Ireland which, because of its geographical remoteness from the rest of Northern Ireland and its large population centres, has suffered from communication problems. That has given rise to a range of social and economic difficulties. The local authorities that cover Dungannon. Cookstown, Fermanagh, Omagh and Strabane have individually and collectively made representations to my noble Friend, and they are soon to have meetings with him.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Next week, officials will have a preparatory meeting with members and officers from the authorities to which my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North referred. The authorities have expressed initial disappointment with some of the points that are made in the document. However, my hon. Friend and other members of the Committee will recognise that the significant and structured process of consultation and discussion on these matters is to take place between now and the end of the year, before the final version of the document is produced for our consideration. I am sure that the point, which the hon. Gentleman, local authorities and hon. Members who represent relevant constituencies have rightly raised, will be considered in a much more detailed and structured way than in the past. The Government accept his point.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North also referred to the financial aspect of development. The wish lists in the documents will cost money. I referred to the fact that my successor as Minister with responsibility for finance will have a tough time:
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
solutions do not always depend on money. Sometimes a problem, if considered carefully and wisely, can be resolved through the diversion of existing resources. A careful management exercise will sometimes deal with a problem. Initiatives such as large road schemes are, of course, a matter of financial prioritisation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend Member for Hull, North referred to bus transport. All hon. Members will echo his comments. The hon. Member for East Londonderry also spoke about the issue. In places that are not well served schemes must be imaginative, not just expensive. Such places generally, although not exclusively, contain rural communities. Other schemes such as those involving post buses and mini-buses, and all sorts of initiatives currently being examined, would cost less in serving those areas than a traditional large bus service. I hope that best practice in Britain and in other countries in the European Union and beyond will show the direction in which we should go. Unless those areas get proper public transport, the quality of life will be affected and people will feel isolated and remote. Of course, we must try to avoid that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The final decisions on the sale of Belfast harbour will be made after responsibility passes to a local administration. I understand that the commissioners are currently working out detailed proposals for the Government's consideration. They are required to consult widely in framing those proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I also take the point by my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North about cross-border consultation on transport issues, which is a significant aspect of development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
His comment was timely in relation to the agreement. Part of the talks concentrated precisely on that and on how best decent transport links throughout Ireland could be provided, especially where they help the local economies of counties, north and south, which straddle the border. We shall take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South made some interesting comments, some of which I have addressed. I agree that definitions of accessibility and the appalling word peripherality must be considered during the next six months of consultation, so that their meaning can be established. I accept that people must take care not to make out that things are more peripheral than they are. I represent a constituency in Wales that suffers from the same types of definition and one has to be very careful to ensure that young people are not using them. People wrongly speak of peripherality, but it is well known that places in Wales, Northern Ireland and elsewhere in Britain have advantages from being on the edge, which, I assume, is what peripherality means.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South referred to sustainable development, which is especially significant. Part of my Ministerial responsibility for Northern Ireland in Europe is to visit the district partnerships. The hon. Gentleman paid tribute to them,
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0719">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>37</span>
as I do. The message that we are giving them, especially now that we are coming to the end of the peace and reconciliation funds, is that the schemes should be capable of carrying on when funding is complete. Schemes must be sustainable, certainly in the medium term. From a constituency and city point of view, the hon. Gentleman referred specifically to waste disposal in Belfast. The Government are awaiting the outcome of a public inquiry into a proposed waste incinerator and a decision will be made later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde (Dr. Godman), rightly referred, as always, to targeting social need. I assure him that that is always in our minds when making policy because it is especially important. He referred to links with Scotland in relation to tourism and to the ports. I am sure that my noble Friend the Minister will have taken note of my hon. Friend's comments on the Ballycastle and Campbeltown ferry service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to make special reference to the concept of a council of the isles. Part of the agreement deals with the relationships between Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. My hon. Friend touched on the important links of tourism and transport infrastructure, which are vital to the joint developments of those countries. It is important that people understand that the council of the isles will deal with meaningful aspects of government and the way in which people lead their lives. I shall ensure that we write to my hon Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde on his detailed points on fishing policies.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Dr. Godman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am exceedingly grateful to my hon. Friend for his comments on the proposed council of the isles. It will have an important role to play, particularly in terms of transport and fishing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Despite my great respect for the Minister, I am deeply sorry that he rejected my suggestion that The New Assembly should be housed in a new building, designed by the winner of an international architecture competition. The people of Northern Ireland should be given parity of esteem with those of Wales and Scotland. We in Scotland are to have a new Parliment. Six years ago, when I suggested that it should be housed in a new building, my fellow Scottish Labour Members ridiculed me, but at this very moment, a competition to design such a building is taking place. I urge the Minister to think again about a new building for the Northern Ireland New Assembly.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The rejection stands only until the first meeting of the New Assembly. After that, I am delighted to say that the issue is for the assembly itself to decide. It will be in shadow form as opposed to Scotland and Wales, where there will be no shadow assemblies. If members of the Northern Ireland Assembly want to hold a competition among architects for a new building, that will be a matter for them. I merely say, in my capacity as the Minister with responsibility for finance, that they will have to find the money for it.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>38</span>
The New Assembly will come to deal with all the matters including planning and transport, with which we have dealt today. The document is not simply about land use but about economics, social structure and Northern Ireland's links with Europe.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to debate the quality of the electoral register in Northern Ireland and the means of identifying voters. It is right to pay tribute to the professionalism and dedication of the chief electoral officer and his staff.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Some of the perceived failings in the system stem from faulty legislation. They have been exacerbated by a too-rigid interpretation of the legislation, which meant that genuine voters who appeared with incomplete documents or documents that were not current were turned away. Others who attended polling stations with documents which, although they clearly identified them, were not those listed in the legislation were likewise turned away. Some returned with proper documentation but others did not. We asked for the number of those who were rejected to be recorded, but that request has been consistently refused on the specious grounds that they will come back. I am aware of people who have since refused even to have their names on the register. I vividly recollect a gentleman in his nineties with an old medical card who was rejected. He was not stealing someone else's vote, but, tragically, the state did not allow him his franchise.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In general, I concur with the assessment of Dr. Amy McGrath, an Australian, who is an expert and author on electoral reform. According to a report in one of the papers, she was lavish in her praise of Mr. Pat Bradley and his system to deter electoral fraud. At the same time, I want to improve on weaknesses in the system, and I refute claims by those who say that it cannot be bettered. I am old fashioned and believe that the biggest room in the world is the room for improvement. In my early days as an assistant minister, my senior rebuked the convenor of the general assembly for using the words, "It was the best I could do." He said, "Your best is not good enough." We have to be careful not to rest on our laurels, thinking that we have done our best.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Before the referendum, my office faced constituents who were unable to vote for various reasons. I discovered that that situation was replicated elsewhere.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0720">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>39</span>
Few stations in the referendum were manned by polling agents. I cannot speak of impersonation or fraud at the stations, but with such a high turnout in some constituencies it would be difficult to claim that there was none. That is especially so in the light of previous evidence produced by the Committee in the Northern Ireland forum and the Select Committee in the House of Commons.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When issues are raised with officers responsibility is placed on the shoulders of the elector, who should have checked the draft register in December at the local post office. The majority of electors do not check it, and I doubt whether they do in Great Britain.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
One instance that has been drawn to my attention concerns a family in my constituency, who have lived in the same house—No. 6—for 29 years. Members of the family filled in the necessary form and left it with their neighbour to return because they would be on holiday when the agent from the electoral office called. The neighbours appear on the register and I understand from my investigation that they returned the two forms. The electoral office claimed that it had no form for No. 6. Bearing in mind that the register is compiled from the forms, it is surprising that the office was able to put two other names down for No. 6 in place of those of my three constituents. The two people whose names appeared at No. 6 lived in another house in the same street and were down in the register for that house. We have been told of the possibility of cross-checking duplicates by computer, but I was told that there was no apparent reason to cross-check and that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the two addresses are quite far apart on the Register".</p></blockquote>
If numbers directly across from each other in the same street cause difficulty, how can we be assured that multiple claims are not still being made, as was manifest in earlier investigations? How many people have been charged with falsifying claims?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other cases that have been drawn to my attention may be more excusable but reflect carelessness on the part not only of the householder but also, in my judgment, of the agent employed to verify and collect the forms. One Roman Catholic woman who gave the form to the agent advised that her son was entitled to vote. The son's name was added, but that of her husband, who was temporarily absent on business, was omitted. I am assured that the lady signed the form, so is culpable, but also that she said that her husband lived at that address. I have not been able to verify whether the agent added her name to the register, but the father's name was omitted although his son's was included.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The names of two people living at 43 Carmel street were removed from the register. Although their house had a "For Sale" sign outside it throughout August and September, they did not take up their new accommodation until December 1997. Therefore, they
	<span class='label label-info column'>40</span>
should have appeared on the new register at their previous address.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A Mr. Hugh Close of 6 Beech park was on the permanent voters' list. He returned his form to say that he was still at that address but did not get a postal vote in the referendum. A chemist in Finagh wrongly attested the two forms of Paul and D.C. Macmillan because they were on holiday. The electoral office turned down both of them because people are only supposed to sign for one proxy vote. The Macmillans are husband and wife, but the electoral office did not have even the wisdom of Solomon: it did not divide them, but merely decided that neither should have a vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other colleagues have had similar problems. For example, in east Antrim a man previously not registered as a member of the security services filled in his form, which was collected from the address at which he had lived for nine years. He got no vote, but a polling card arrived for his son, who had served in the Royal Air Force for at least 10 years. No doubt, the electoral officers were hard pressed, but there is no excuse for people not getting postal votes.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The telephones seemed to be very busy in the Belfast offices. People's queries were not answered and applications went astray. My hon. Friend the Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) has written to the chief electoral officer about that and other errors. One lady received two poll cards. One was for her previous residence, which she left in September 1996 and the other was for her current address, where she took up residence in the same month.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the debate of 23 April, my hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) raised the issue of electoral fraud. He pressed for steps to be taken to identify people, and referred to an agency in Northern Ireland that has photographs of some 900,000 citizens and information about them that would enable proper IDs to be printed in a week. Why, in the face of such pressure, have no steps yet been taken to produce proper IDs? They should be the same for every citizen and provide identification by picture, by name and address and by national insurance number. That would make it impossible for people any longer to get away with fraud.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The tragedy is that, in the panic following the alleged mass theft of votes in Northern Ireland, the House introduced a form of protection. Some of the suggestions were unbelievable, such as that a rent book would provide sufficient identification. I told the House then that some people in west Belfast would give their rent books to anyone [	<i>Laughter.</i>] Social security books were also suggested, but they do not identify people. They only carry the name of the person making a claim: no other identification is made.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other documents, such as British and Irish passports and the Northern Ireland driving licence, do identify the holder. They are listed as legal documents, and I empathise with the chief electoral officer, who has to see that the law is upheld. The fault lies with the
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0721">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>41</span>
legislation passed in this House and I hope that it can be rectified speedily. Social security books do not identify the holder: they say only that the name and address are the same as on the register. Only documents with pictures, a name and address offer proper identification. The chief electoral officer has instructed his staff to implement the use of the documents rigorously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am sure that the Minister will remember the debate on the New Northern Ireland Assembly (Elections) Order 1998 on 14 May. I urged the Minister to give guidance to the chief electoral officer that the law should be implemented with a degree of discretion. I was assured that he would. I understand that that guidance has not been changed. Thus, for example, an old social security book that contained no payment slip would not be an acceptable ID as it would not be current. Some people, of course, have no other form of ID because they do not have a passport or driving licence.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Matters can get even more absurd. A person with a passport expiring on 21 May who did not send it away for renewal in time for the referendum would find that it was turned down for not being a current document, even though it contained the person's name and picture. The Northern Ireland driving licence is a rather cumbersome thing in a plastic folder. Many people carry only the little section bearing the photograph, name and address of the holder. It also states which categories of vehicle the holder can drive and when the licence expires. [	<i>Interruption.</i>]
My hon. Friend the Member for East Londonderry is very helpful and has given me his driving licence so that I can show you the section to which I refer. On its own, the section does not count as a current driving licence. I cannot understand why not, as the document is still current.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I contend, and the Minister agreed with me in the 14 May debate, that we must encourage people to use the franchise. There is something wrong when the rules are interpreted so that people with genuine identity documents do not get the vote, but others with forged documents, such as fake medical cards, do—as was attested to the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs and in the forum.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The problem was that, under electoral law, even the presiding officer can challenge an identification without the support of a polling agent. Although police officers could identify people who go regularly to the polling station, apparently to vote, they could do nothing because they had no remit during the election other that to protect the security of the station and those going in and out. We must look hard and fast at the problem, which affects not only Northern Ireland. There is growing evidence of confusion over the names and identity of people voting in Great Britain. We should have a proper system of identification for all citizens.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I trust that the Minister will use his best endeavours to improve the system so that people who are entitled to vote can do so according to the rules. That will, in
	<span class='label label-info column'>42</span>
turn, increase the numbers of people registered to vote. We had to fight for the people of Northern Ireland to get a postal vote when they were on holiday because some in the electoral office in Northern Ireland argued that that should not happen. To support our argument in the discussions we asked what would happen if, on the beach in Barcelona, a person from Belfast got into conversation with a person from Bradford who said, "I got my postal vote away," and the person from Belfast replied, "What do you mean, you got your postal vote away? We do not have postal votes in Belfast."
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We fought for postal votes because we want students who are away from home, people who are on holiday, and people who are away on business to have the right to a postal vote. That right must not be hampered by the system. At the same time, we want electoral registers to be improved and the position on identification documents to be made clear.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: This interesting debate arises from a matter that was raised by the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) some weeks ago. Presumably, it is a consequence of examples from the referendum, such as those that the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) quoted.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Politicians face nightmare situations at election time, one of which is when we offer someone transport to a polling station and he comes out and tells us that he has not voted for us. Another nightmare quoted by the hon. Member for Belfast, South is that some people, especially older people, may come a long way and take a great deal of trouble only to find when they get to the polling station that they cannot vote. I sympathise with them; we fought a long time for the franchise in this country and older people especially are conscious of that. We must balance the need to ensure that everyone's right to a vote is sovereign against the difficulties that are created by fraudulent activities, especially in Northern Ireland, and we must keep trying to strike the right balance.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I assume the hon. Member for Belfast, South that we will pass on the cases that he raised in Committee to the chief electoral officer so that he can answer each one individually. The hon. Gentleman knows that the issue of identity has caused great concern to Members from Northern Ireland, and to the Government, for some time. The hon. Gentleman was right to show the Committee how we could tackle the matter. As he knows, the forum and the Select Committee on Northern Ireland held separate investigations into electoral mailpractice. Both bodies, helpfully, passed their findings to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who will deal with matter soon. Both bodies made a case for a single identification document but there are various practical problems whatever is chosen. We are seriously considering all suggestions and hope to overcome some of the problems that the hon. Gentleman has raised. Of course, we must not rush the matter because if we make the wrong
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0722">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>43</span>
decision we might have to spend much money and time putting it right. However, we shall carefully consider this important matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I take the hon. Gentleman's point about discretion. The chief electoral officer is not a creature of the Government, but an Officer of the House. He is answerable to the courts. Clearly, the identification that a voter must present at a polling station must be valid. Although it may seem especially obvious to the hon. Gentleman and me that it is sensible to do this or that, a challenge would apply to the electoral officer because of the people for whom he is responsible, and would cause enormous difficulties. The answer is to ensure that there is a proper identification document, which everybody knows has to be up to date and which can be taken to the polling station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
With regard to notification, I am assured that every household in Northern Ireland was sent a reminder about the documents, to ensure that people brought valid documentation to the polling station.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, South also referred to the accuracy and compilation of the register itself. As I said, it is a huge frustration for a voter when he finds that his name is not on the register at the polling station. That can happen to voters, often through no fault of their own. I believe, however, that Northern Ireland arrangements are better than those of England and Wales. As the hon. Gentleman knows, a postal canvas occurs. It does not operate in the same way in my constituency. Northern Ireland has two opportunities. A lot of work must be done to ensure that the register is accurate as possible, bearing in mind that the accuracy of the Northern Ireland register is, on balance, very good. Work must still be done, and will be considered in the review carried out by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The chief electoral officer, for example, has referred to a suggestion that an investigation squad should be established to investigate claims of fraud all year round, to follow up on suspicions and entries and to check the validity of applications. The idea of two registers a year has also been proposed, to be compiled in November and April, with a public notice put up before the second date advising people to check whether they were on the November register. We could consider other aspects. The Home Office is considering how to improve the comprehensiveness and validity of the register. All such issues are important. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the
	<span class='label label-info column'>44</span>
Secretary of State will take into account the points that the Home Office makes in its review.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall not burden the Committee with further details. I assure the hon. Member for Belfast, South that the individual cases will be investigated. The fact that this is the second debate on the issue in weeks shows that the matter is of huge concern to the people of Northern Ireland. As I have said, we must balance the absolute right of people to cast their votes—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has told the Committee that something will happen soon, and we are grateful for that assurance. He has also expressed the Government's concerns about the whole matter being carried through with due care so that no mistakes are made. Will he tell us what steps the Secretary of State intends to take in order to facilitate the process, and to ensure that consultation results at least in preliminary decisions about what must be done? All the constitutional political parties, as I would call them, are deeply concerned about the matter. We want everything to be done absolutely right, and we are always available to give more advice and to engage in further discussion.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. Strictly speaking, interventions are not in order during an Adjournment debate, but if the Minister wishes to respond he may do so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am delighted to respond to the hon. Member for East Londonderry and to say that, as he knows, a substantial consultation exercise has been done, involving all the political parties in Northern Ireland and others with an interest in the matter. They have put their points of view forward. For example, members of the forum made a case for changing significant aspects, as did the Select Committee on Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I are more than happy to discuss, in consultation, a number of issues with parties in Northern Ireland during coming weeks and months. The hon. Member for East Londonderry was right to say that we have to get it right. Elections to Europe will occur next year, and we must ensure that Northern Ireland gets the best possible system, bearing in mind the important balance to which I have referred.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
