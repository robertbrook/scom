<p>[MR. BARRY JONES <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We begin with oral questions and I remind the Committee that this item of business must end at 11 o'clock.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman A. Godman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Jones. We have 30 minutes for oral questions and I think that the same applies to the Welsh Grand Committee. As a Scottish Member I think I am right in saying that, according to the Standing Order No. 94, the Scottish Grand Committee has an oral question period of 45 minutes. What is good for us Scots should be good for Northern Ireland Members. That may be outwith your jurisdiction as a Committee Chairman, Mr. Jones, but I think that an extra 15 minutes should be given to this Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Committee follows the Standing Orders correctly. it is for the hon. Gentleman to draw his views and perhaps those of others to the attention of the appropriate House authorities.</span></p>

Abortion Law</div> <!-- title -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p>1. <span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If she will make a statement on abortion law in Northern Ireland.(24144)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We have no plans to extend the Abortion Act 1967 to Northern Ireland. However, legal experts, including High Court judges, have criticised the current state of law in Northern Ireland as unclear. It is important, especially for doctors and women, that the present uncertainty over the law in Northern Ireland is dispelled. As everyone knows, this is a controversial and sensitive issue and Ministers will wish to take a considered view before any decision on future action is taken.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Barnes</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister will be aware that in the past five years 9,000 or more women from Northern Ireland have had to come to Great Britain for abortions. Surveys in Northern Ireland show that in some respects there is majority support in the Catholic and Protestant communities for abortions in cases where women are suffering from mental and physical problems that are confirmed by doctors. In those circumstances would not it be appropriate to adopt the stance of the previous Government who said that if a Northern Ireland Member presented legislation similar to the 1967 Great Britain measure it would be given fair weather in the House. Could that be extended so that if any hon. Member with an interest in Northern Ireland introduced such a measure that it would also be given fair weather?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As I have said, we have no agenda to extend the Abortion Act 1967 to Northern Ireland. As my hon. Friend will know, such measures have traditionally been framed in private Member's Bills and regarded not as party issues but as matters for individual consciences. If there is to be change, the preferable way for it to happen is in a devolved administration in Northern Ireland or, alternatively, by way of a private Member's Bill from a Northern Ireland Member. Beyond that I would not want to go.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's response. It has been said that the same legislation should apply throughout the United Kingdom. Does he accept that scores of Bills and Acts differentiate between Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England? Does he agree that one of the issues that we must bear in mind in framing social legislation is the concern of the majority of people in any community?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate that there is great concern on this issue. A Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights report in 1993 or 1994 said that Northern Ireland law would not stand up to international standards. When High Court judges, obstetricians and health boards draw out attention to faults in the law we must take them into account and decide whether any action needs to be taken. This is a matter on which no decisions have been taken.</span></p>

Public Order Arrests</div> <!-- title -->
<p>2. <span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How many persons were arrested, charged, and convicted under Articles 7(1), 9(1), 18(1), 19(1), 20(1) and 22(1) of the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 in 1989; and how many of those persons were taking part in legal parades.<br><br>
(24145)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Statistics relating to arrests and charges under the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 during 1989 were not collated by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. However, during 1989, 2,566 persons were proceeded against in the courts and 2,267 persons were found guilty of offences under the articles that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. They relate to all offences as it is not possible to identify those that specifically relate to parades.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister insist that the RUC takes special note of and records the arrests, charges and convictions under these articles so that we can get clear figures, which will illustrate that there are few public order charges in relation to parades.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were a little puzzled by the hon. Gentleman's specific interest in 1989. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill which creates new offences is going through the House. The RUC and those who compile the statistics will want to take into account the impact of that legislation upon their statistics collecting mechanisms. I shall certainly forward the hon. Gentleman's comments to the RUC and to others who collect statistics.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Shona Mclsaac</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Do the Government accept that the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Bill is not

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
directed against parades? Will the Minister tell the Committee about the Bill's progress and whether it will be in place before this year's marching season?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her question as it gives me the opportunity to endorse the fact that, as the North report said, this issue is about competing rights. One of the rights is the ability to peaceful assembly. It is written into the Bill that one of the major criteria to be taken into account is the fact that there are traditional parades in the area. The Bill seeks to regulate and promote parades under peaceful circumstances so that there are proper safeguards for all the parties who are involved.</span></p>

Housing Executive</div> <!-- title -->
<p>3. <span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What steps she takes to monitor the religious affiliations of those employed by the Housing Executive. (24146)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State does not monitor the religious affiliation of staff working for any employer, including the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. The monitoring of the religious composition of work forces of organisations with 10 or more staff is carried out by the Fair Employment Commission. According to its figures for the year to the end of 1996, the composition of the Housing Executive was 51 per cent. Protestant, 46 per cent. Roman Catholic and 3 per cent. not known. Those figures are published in the commission's report "A Profile of the Northern Ireland Workforce: Summary of the Monitoring Returns" a copy of which is available in the Library.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not apparent from those figures that there is a gross employment imbalance against the Protestant population in the Housing Executive? Is it not a fact that the crude figures that we are given by the Fair Employment Commission do not really tell us what is happening at the various levels? Whenever that body investigates any employer of that nature it looks at employment at every level and makes criticisms when it finds imbalances against Roman Catholics. Is he also aware that, in relation to recruits to the Housing Executive, there is an imbalance of 80 per cent. Roman Catholic to 20 per cent. Protestant? Will he examine those figures and see what can be done to remove the chill factor within that organisation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not accept what the hon. Gentleman says. Over the past few years, there has been a slight increase in the number of Catholics employed in the Housing Executive, but that is mainly the result of older people leaving the executive and not being replaced. At some levels, the service has shrunk and that has had the effect of increasing the percentage of Catholics in the work force. As recently as 1997, the Fair Employment Commission monitored the Housing Executive's arrangements and came to an agreement with it. That will ensure that the feelings of hon. Members such as the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) can be taken into account and
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
that the employment practices of every public agency in Northern Ireland are fair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McGrady</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What progress has been made regarding the recent SACHR report on fair employment and the general review of the 1987 legislation? When will the report be published?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A considerable amount of time over the past seven or eight months has been spent going through the 163 recommendations in the SACHR report. We have now done that and within the next two to three months we will be able to make some recommendations.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that the composition of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights in Northern Ireland has caused considerable anxiety among the majority community? We do not regard its composition or membership as a fair or balanced reflection of views in Northern Ireland. The Minister would do well to examine the composition of that commission when he assesses its findings. He should be aware that the majority community has no confidence in it.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hear what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said, but we have taken precautions to ensure that such bodies are balanced. Moreover, there has recently been a reconstitution of SACHR. We want to ensure a balanced view reflecting the Northern Ireland community so that the SACHR's findings can be seen to be above board—and I believe that they are.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Osborne</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell the Committee whether there has been any independent assessment of the employment practices and composition of the Housing Executive work force?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I can. All employers of more than 10 employees in Northern Ireland are subject to the provisions of the Fair Employment Commission, which ensures through agreement with employers that appropriate action will be taken when there are genuine grounds for concern. I have every confidence in the commission' independence.</span></p>

Northern Ireland Assembly</div> <!-- title -->
<p>4. <span class='member'>Mr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What recent discussions she has had with party political representatives concerning matters relating to the creation of a Northern Ireland Assembly based upon proportional representation.<br><br>
(24147)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It will not surprise my hon. Friend to know that we have had a large number of discussions about the return and form of future institutions of government in Northern Ireland, in strand one of the multi-party talks.<br><br>
The two Governments' "Propositions on Heads of Agreement" paper, which was produced in the light of those discussions and debated on 12 January, envisaged democratically elected institutions in Northern Ireland, to include a Northern Ireland assembly elected by a system of proportional representation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Godman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: With my customary politeness, may I point out to my hon. Friend that there can be no setting

up of an assembly without concomitant radical constitutional change elsewhere—for example, along a north-south or east-west axis? If a legislature is to be created in Northern Ireland it should be more akin to the model of a Scottish Parliament that is currently being considered than to a Welsh assembly.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The proposals in the heads of agreement paper emerged from talks among most of the political parties. The only party that has not spoken about an assembly with proportional representation is Sinn Fein. It is important for all those involved to get to grips with the talks and work out what is best for Northern Ireland rather than be encouraged to opt for a model elsewhere. There may be merit in some models elsewhere but we are seeking a Northern Ireland solution.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In so far as the hon. Member for Greenock and Inverclyde is calling for majority rule in Northern Ireland, we welcome his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is difficult to detect the interrogative in that statement, but I understand what the hon. Gentleman says. I can only repeat that what matters now, after the sense of progress created over the past two or three weeks by the welcome for the heads of agreement statement, is that those involved get to grips with the issues and make further solid progress. That is how we will find a solution.</span></p>

Planning Service</div> <!-- title -->
<p>5. <span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If she will explain the difference in planning terms between (a) a condition voluntarily agreed between an applicant and the planning service and (b) a condition imposed by the planning service when a planning application is approved. (24148)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Conditions are not voluntarily agreed between an applicant and the planning service; there is no difference in planning terms whether or not an applicant consents to a condition.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his interesting answer. Is he aware that a voluntary agreement was entered into by the planning service and a building concern in my constituency? Is he now saying that that voluntary agreement does not exist or that it carries all the power of the law? If the planning service, having agreed a voluntary condition, removes it at the stroke of a pen, what are the implications under the law? Is there not an element of malpractice there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman found my answer interesting. I said in effect that there was no such thing as a voluntary agreement. It is irrelevant whether an applicant for planning permission finds the conditions imposed by the planning body agreeable. What matters is that planning conditions are imposed. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman is talking about Cottonmount and I suggest that he awaits the outcome of his talks with my noble Friend Lord Dubs. I would not want to go any further on the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Planning matters should be considered at all levels, from the bottom to the top. It is
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
the planning applicant's merit that should be considered when deciding whether it should be accepted. A straightsforward agreement can be interpreted as a private agreement if there is no contradiction of the regulations. Planning in Northern Ireland needs to be considered in total. A satisfactory conclusion to the talks would give impetus to consideration of the Northern Ireland planning regulations and laws and perhaps open up some local planning issues. The is an important and significant factor in the talks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome my hon. Friend's contribution. Planning will be one of the prizes if we can make a success of the talks. The way in which planning matters are decided within Northern Ireland at the moment is not satisfactory. The system is less than ideal, as members of the Committee will agree. As I have said, if in the next few weeks we can bring the talks to a satisfactory conclusion, the matter can be considered by a devolved administration.</span></p>

Surgical Waiting Lists</div> <!-- title -->
<p>6. <span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What progress has been made in reducing waiting lists for elective surgery.<br><br>
(24149)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The growth in waiting lists is directly attributable to the previous Administration's decision to make a 3 per cent. cut in Northern Ireland's health and personal social services budget in 1996–97. That had a devastating effect on waiting lists because it was the controllable part of the budget.<br><br>
The Government are committed to reversing the spiralling growth in waiting lists which we have inherited. I have taken immediate action to increase the number of operations in the current year. The Government have made available additional money amounting to£33 million in 1997–98 to tackle a range of services including emergency admissions, community care and waiting lists themselves. I am pleased to report that boards have been able to use this extra funding to contract for about 10,000 operations already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's answer and the fact that more money has been made available. Does he agree that there is still an imbalance, especially in elective surgery, when people wait an unduly long time for cardiac and hip operations? Those with cancer face a long wait, too. Can the Minister assure us that a continuing review of finance will replace some of the shortfall in the budget of the Eastern board, which caters for so many people in Northern Ireland and for specialist services in the region, so that finances might be better balanced?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Gentleman knows, I accepted the findings of the capitation review which showed that there was an underspend according to need in the Eastern board. I expect that in future years the Eastern board will benefit.<br><br>
Waiting lists are more complicated than they sound because they are affected by a multitude of factors. I have an internal team in the Department of Health and Social Services working to identify where management
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0653">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
is not as effective as it might be in reducing waiting lists. We shall add external advisers to that team to increase the drive to reduce waiting lists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Department of Health and Social Services still require the boards and trusts to make efficiency savings? What will be the level of those savings? In his answer, will the Minister refer to his opening statement that the previous Government made a 3 per cent. cut in 1996–97?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have abolished the sort of fiction that a Minister in the previous Government related when he spoke about the efficiency savings that were deemed to have occurred although boards and trusts had mounting deficits each year. We were left with an absurd inheritance. Efficiency savings were deemed to have been made, but trusts and boards were in debt. The mathematical logic of that is beyond me.</span></p>

Friend yesterday met senior representatives of Bombardier and Shorts and has agreed to meet the trade unions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister agree that, when large amounts of public funds are invested in a private company, clear announcements should be made when redundancy decisions are taken by the company? If the trade unions had been convinced that the current spate of redundancies arose because of a change in the cycle of employment and not because of a threat by Bombardier Aerospace Shorts to move altogether and to relocate to its parent company, that would have avoided anxiety among those who will inevitably lose their jobs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that more will come out in the meetings that the Minister of State is holding with senior management and the trade unions. However, Shorts has assured us that its strategy is to remain an integrated design-and-manufacturing operation, and that is fully endorsed by Bombardier. The fears that have been expressed by the hon. Gentleman and others that the operation in Northern Ireland will simply become an assembly operation are contradicted by the information that we are receiving from Shorts. I do not want to say more until the meetings between the Minister of State and the trade unions and management have taken place.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister comment on the overall economic, employment and investment climate in Northern Ireland? Will he also pay particular regard to the port of Belfast? An important feature in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
development of Northern Ireland's economy would be the development of the port of Belfast. The airports are reasonably developed, but if we could generate more trade through the port and keep it in the public sector, that would benefit Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall certainly ensure that my hon. Friend the Minister of State is made aware of my hon. Friend's comments on the port of Belfast.<br><br>
There is much that is positive about the Northern Ireland economy. Over the past year, long-term unemployment has fallen by more than 30 per cent. It is a long time since people heard such good news. There are good signs for exports. Northern Ireland manufacturing exports continue to grow and the continuation of that trend is vital to the economy. Those on the Opposition benches will also know the amount of inward investment that major British and international firms have made in the retail sector. Those are but three signs of the progress being made. We shall seek to continue in that view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the agreement signed by the previous Government permit Bombardier to transfer sections of the business back to Canada without any restrictions? Did the agreement include a provision that Bombardier would have to retain the name of Shorts? It was reported at the weekend that Bombardier might drop that name, which has a considerable lineage in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall ensure that those concerns are conveyed to the Minister of State and I shall ask him to get in touch with the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>

Punishment Beatings</div> <!-- title -->
<p>8. <span class='member'>Mr. Robathan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What investigations she is conducting to identify the perpetrators of recent punishment beatings. (24151)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: This is primarily a matter for the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The police investigate all assaults reported to them, but there are many difficulties associated in making those responsible amenable, principally the reluctance of victims to assist the investigation process and the absence of evidence.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robathan</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is not a satisfactory answer, and I doubt that many people in Northern Ireland would think that it was satisfactory. Does the Minister agree that the Northern Ireland Office has tremendous resources at its disposal, through the Army and the police? Does he also agree that, apart from the Northern Ireland Office, everyone in Northern Ireland knows who is behind the punishment beatings? Any man, or woman, on the street in Northern Ireland will say that the hand of the IRA and Sinn Fein is to be found behind the punishment beatings in Catholic areas. Sinn Fein has not signed up to the Mitchell principles. When will the Government admit that? They have quite rightly admitted it in the case of the Ulster Democratic party.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not possible to prosectute the hand of the IRA or Sinn Fein. It is possible to prosecute only people against whom there is evidence. The

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
Government think that the proper process of law should be followed—I am sure that Opposition Members agree with that. The major difficulty in such prosecutions is in obtaining evidence. The main way out of that difficulty is to make a success of the peace talks and to establish a proper civil society in Northern Ireland. Then we will not have that problem.<br><br>
In the meantime, I encourage everyone—whether at the talks or outside them—who has influence on the people who are conducting punishment beatings, to use that influence to improve the climate in Northern Ireland and to put a stop to the beatings. I also encourage people to use the confidential information lines, because punishment beatings are against everyone's interest.</span></p>

Rate Relief</div> <!-- title -->
<p>9. <span class='member'>Mr. Trimble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If she will make a statement on rate relief for general shops and community facilities in rural areas. (24152)</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Government have decided to bring forward a Rates (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order which will make various changes in Northern Ireland's rating and valuation legislation. A draft of the order will be published for consultation purposes around the end of April and this will contain proposals relating to rate relief for general stores and post offices in rural settlements in Northern Ireland. It is hoped the legislation can be in place by 1 April next year.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trimble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister's reply belatedly implements undertakings given by the previous
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
Government after equivalent legislation was enacted for Scotland, Wales and England.<br><br>
I note that the Minister referred to shops and post offices. Is not it the case that current legislation in Great Britain also relates to other properties that have a general community use, such as village halls? Will there be similar provisions in the Northern Ireland order? Will the order also take account of the different occupational patterns in the Northern Ireland countryside? We do not have closely defined villages such as those in Great Britain. Will our more dispersed community facilities be included in the legislation?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The question sounds innocent, but with one slip of my tongue I could spend millions of pounds. I shall not do that. The draft order will be produced. There will be genuine consultations and the complications of discretionary relief can be examined and debated. The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that to say yes to one criterion of community purpose would open other doors. The matter needs careful deliberation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trimble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: On a point of Order, Mr. Jones. I am sorry to delay the Minister, and emulate the behaviour of his hon. Friend. However, notwithstanding one's amazement at the Minister's versatility in answering questions, is not it possible to ensure that in future the Secretary of State and the Ministers responsible will be present to answer the questions that are directed to them?</span></p>

Education Priorities in Northern Ireland</div> <!-- title -->
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Committee that the debate can continue until 1 o'clock. While I have no power to impose a time limit on speeches, it would assist me in calling as many hon. Members as possible if contributions are kept reasonably brief.</span></p>
<p>11.6 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>"That the Chairman do now report to the House that the Committee has considered the matter of priorities in education in Northern Ireland."</p></blockquote>
Welcome to the Chair, Mr. Jones. I am sure that your Welsh charm will work even with the hon. Members who are assembled here.<br><br>
I welcome the debate for the opportunity that it provides to outline some of the things that we have been doing and many of those that we shall do in the coming months and years. The Government recognise that learning is the key to the future that that lifelong learning is essential to economic prosperity. Education is at the heart of our policy agenda. We are strongly committed to promoting higher standards of achievement and maximising opportunities for learning.<br><br>
We have already begun substantially to fulfil the manifesto commitment that education spending will rise over the five years of this Parliament. That is reflected in the allocations for 1998–99, in which the Government's priorities are clearly demonstrated by the fact that, within the fixed overall control totals, additional provision is found for schools and further and higher education.<br><br>
Since I assumed responsibility for education in Northern Ireland I have been repeatedly impressed by many features of the education system, particularly the high degree of commitment by teachers generally to providing the best education possible. That teaching force is envied by many. However, a great deal more can be done to raise education standards in Northern Ireland. We need to pay more attention, not to England, as has been traditional in Northern Ireland, but to European and world attainment standards. We should model ourselves on the best. We have much to build on—all the ingredients for the best education system in Northern Ireland. We should set our sights no lower than that.<br><br>
My aim is to raise standards for all pupils, not just low-attaining ones. There is a tendency to think that we must concentrate on under-achievers. We must raise standards all round if Northern Ireland is to have the service that it needs and deserves for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Minister's statement, and appreciate its emphasis. Previously I felt that an attempt was being made to bring the standard of education in Northern Ireland down to the level in England, whereas traditionally we have looked more towards Scotland. Does the Minister accept that perhaps we place too much emphasis on academic attainment as opposed to vocational training, which is needed to raise the standard of the underachievers?</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A great deal can be said about that. One of the failings of the British education system is that it has taken so long to establish a credible system of vocational qualifications. If the hon. Gentleman has read some of my views expressed in Northern Ireland, he will know that if I have emphasised any one matter, it has been further education. That has been neglected, within a framework—stronger in Northern Ireland than anywhere else—that has stressed academic attainment, and undersold the further education sector. That state of affairs is a challenge throughout the United Kingdom, but it is more difficult to put it right in Northern Ireland because of the impact of the rest of the system on further education.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Norman A. Godman <span class='memberconstituency'>(Greenock and Inverclyde)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I remind the Minister that the second report of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs, which is entitled "Underachievement in Northern Ireland Secondary Schools", and was published on 19 February 1997, concluded:
<br><blockquote><p>"There is considerable work to be done, especially in monitoring the use of money allocated to overcome underchievement associated with social deprivation."</p></blockquote>
Is that monitoring exercise taking place?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ask my hon. Friend to be patient. I cannot deal with all matters at the beginning of my speech. I shall tackle that point later. However, my next point is relevant to my hon. Friend's question.<br><br>
Next month, I shall announce a school improvement programme that will challenge and support, in equal measure, all schools to help them raise their standards. The programme will focus on the most fundamental building blocks of success in any school. Discipline creates and maintains an orderly working environment in which every child can learn and every teacher can teach effectively. Literacy and numeracy are the most basic skills that open the door to all other learning. The quality of principals and headteachers determines whether a school can improve and the extent of that improvement.<br><br>
The programme will offer more intensive support to the weakest schools, to help them to tackle their weaknesses and to move forward. As my hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Inverclyde would point out, if we provide extra resources for schools, we must know how they are being used and make schools accountable for expenditure.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will that package have a ring-fenced budget?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes.<br><br>
I shall start at the beginning of education, and outline our pre-school education plans. If we are to raise standards significantly, the key starting point is the development of good quality pre-school education. In Northern Ireland, there has been underprovision. Matters have been complicated by the fact that most children start school at the age of four in Northern Ireland rather than five, the age at which children start school in the rest of the United Kingdom. A costed, planned expansion programme for pre-school education starts this year.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0656">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
That expansion will be targeted on those children who will benefit most, especially children from socially disadvantaged circumstances and the oldest pre-school four-year-olds. For 1998–99, resources of£2·6 million will be available and the target will be to secure 2,200 additional places within the plans, which will be drawn up by pre-school education advisory groups, which will include health and voluntary sector representatives to ensure a co-ordinated provision under the supervision of the education and library boards. In one year, there will be an increase of more than 20 per cent. in preschool provision. The medium-term aim of the expansion programme is to provide up to 7,000 extra places.<br><br>
It is essential to use resources where they are most needed.<br><br>
We have devoted a lot of time to considering that. Again, that emphasises the point of my hon. Friend the Minister for Greenock and Inverclyde. I am committed to achieving commonality of funding for schools. An education system for 1.6 million people has seven ways of funding schools. There are five education and library boards, voluntary grammar schools and integrated schools, which are all funded to a different pattern. I am committed to a single system of funding schools and we have taken steps to achieve that. We made an interim move this year. Part of it involves the need to consider how we can better target social needs funds at the most needy schools. We need to hold those schools to account.<br><br>
We are also proposing in a draft order which is now out for consultation to transfer responsibility for the administration of funding for schools from the Department of Education to the education and library boards. We will make modest savings by doing that and it helps us to move to commonality.<br><br>
When we came into office we had a strange situation. The teaching costs of preparatory departments of grammar schools are funded with £1.5 million of public money to reduce the fees of those schools. Those schools charge pupils a fee. We presented a consultation document on that matter and it caused considerable reaction in terms of the number of letters that have been sent to the Department and to me. We have been considering the matter in great depth.<br><br>
Clearly if one closes the preparatory departments, the cost to the Department will be much greater. It would not be a saving but a cost. We must bear in mind that making a cut in provision would be more expensive. We also have to make sure that alternative places are available. That point was made by the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney) and the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) when they brought a delegation to see me.<br><br>
I have therefore decided that the proposed reduction from 40 to 20 per cent. cannot be certain to be prudent. I propose instead to reduce the subsidy to 30 per cent. of teaching costs. On average, that would result in an increase of about 8 per cent. on existing of parental contributions should schools decide to pass on to all parents by way of increased fees the full amount of the subsidy reduction.<br><br>
Many parents have said that they make financial sacrifices to send their children to those schools. Others
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
have said that they have two or three children at them. Could I point out forcefully to the schools that it is a grant to the schools? One of the factors that is most difficult to accept about the present preparatory schools situation is that we discontinued the assisted places scheme in Great Britain although it at least had an element of testing of means to pay about it. This is a straight grant to the schools which the schools simply distribute across the board. It is totally open to the schools to decide, if there are hard cases, that those cases receive extra assistance. They have not chosen to do that. It has been quite extraordinary to receive hundreds of letters from areas that I had never considered deprived making the point about hardship.<br><br>
We can make a saving of about £230,000 by reducing the subsidy to preparatory schools. That is very valuable. It would enable me to create about 230 extra nursery places and to use the money according to Labour's priorities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister suggesting that the schools should carry out a means test of parents? Does he accept that that could lead to great administrative difficulties and, in some cases, allegations of discrimination? Does he accept that fundamental point?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. and learned Gentleman accept the fundamental point that a flat rate subsidy goes to schools where the only entrance criterion is the ability to pay and that the assistance to those preparatory departments is given across the board without any attempt to take into account the parents' ability to pay?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that these changes were largely generated by a report of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights which indicated that, because preparatory schools were associated with state or Protestant schools, the grant to such schools was subsidising the Protestant middle class? Does he further accept that that sort of suggestion by SACHR and the fact that it has been acted upon to some degree by the Department of Education is the sort of matter that engenders the greatest amount of hostility and community division in Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman seems obsessed with the SACHR report. The proposals have nothing to do with it. In last year's report on under-achievement by the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs attention was drawn to the existence of the preparatory departments. Their existence has been repeatedly drawn to the attention of hon. Members and it is my belief that my proposal to cut the subsidy to them from 40 per cent. of teaching cost to 30 per cent. is fair and enables more resources to be used in other areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The consultation paper suggested an initial reduction to 20 per cent., ultimately reaching zero. In his announcement today, the Minister spoke of a reduction to 30 per cent. but did not say what would happen thereafter. Is that 30 per cent. reduction set for ever? Will he look at the impact it will have on the preparatory schools? Would
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0657">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
he consider putting the subsidy up again if he recognises, as we believe will be the case, that the reduction will impose a greater expense on the education budget as parents will not be able to keep their children at those schools subject to the additional costs?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: When the previous Government reduced the subsidy from 50 per cent. to 40 per cent. there was little sign of any reduction in pupil numbers. We have taken into account the reception that that reduction received and we will monitor the situation again. I can give no assurances either benign or otherwise about the future—no Government would do that. No Government would tie their hands on future actions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe (South Antrim)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Yes, but for the last time.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</span><span class='membercontribution'>: How would the Minister answer my constituent who asked me about the logic of taking funds away from the preparatory school that his children attend and providing money for the integrated sector? We were talking about parental choice. He told me that his choice was to send his children to the preparatory school, which he said was interdenominational and an excellent school. He asked how it was that the preparatory schools would lose out while the intergrated schools, which have the same aims, would receive money. What answer can I give that gentleman?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The only people who choose preparatory schools are those who can afford the fees. I have received many letters from those choosing preparatory schools telling me how grateful I should be to them for saving the state money. When they made their choice of school, I doubt whether that was their primary motive and that they said, "This gives the Mininster responsible for education the opportunity to save money." We should move money on from considering 3,000 of the population of Northern Ireland to considering the education of the majority of children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate the Minister's point, but I am confused about what is happening in Northern Ireland when compared with what takes place in England. Some of my constituents see the changes in education legislation as an attempt to improve education—and I am sure that they achieve that. Does the same apply in Northern Ireland? We want to ensure that the best education is available to all the people of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Will my hon. Friend also enlighten me about those organisations registering as charities? The matter was discussed many years ago, and it was felt that people receiving that type of public funding should register as charities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: To help the Minister make progress, he knows that he may be able to reply to the debate.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to deal with my hon. Friend's point later.<br><br>
We seek to improve education standards for all the population of Northern Ireland. One area in which we shall make great progress over the next few years is in bringing much more technology into the classrooms. The Prime Minister gave the commitment that, by the time of the next election, all United Kingdom schools would be linked to the internet. Appropriately trained teachers will be in place and it will be carried out at a price that every school can afford.<br><br>
Northern Ireland has enormous opportunities to lead the way. Much interest has been shown by the private sector. Because of the computerised local administrative system for schools, schools in Northern Ireland are in some respects ahead of the game. We want to press on with that.<br><br>
On integrated education, we shall respect the wishes of parents who prefer education provision that is different from that offered by controlled and maintained schools. However, a balance must be struck between their demands and those of other parents and the limits imposed by affordability. I will approve grant-aided status for new schools when there is clear evidence that their viability and their ability to provide effective education do not require unreasonable public expenditure.<br><br>
Both the Irish-medium education and the integrated education sectors have expanded in recent years. Both have asked me to reduce the viability threshold for new schools. The building of new schools, however, is not the only way of expanding the integrated sector. The transformation of existing schools will be the most cost effective and appropriate form of expansion. In the past year alone, there have been nine applications for transformation, of which seven have been successful. In Irish-medium education, the creation of free-standing schools is not the only option. A satellite arrangement with an Irish-medium school or a unit attached to an English-medium school can also be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Trimble <span class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister has spoken about the special provision made for education in the Irish language. There are few native speakers of Irish in Northern Ireland, but there are substantially larger numbers of Chinese speakers. There is considerable evidence of disadvantage suffered by Chinese people who lack knowledge of, and fluency in, English. Indeed, they are the only section of the community that is disadvantaged in that respect. Are any measures being taken to alleviate that disadvantage?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We were pleased that the previous Government brought in the community relations legislation—about 25 years after the rest of the United Kingdom. The relevant body has been set up and we are developing close links with that organisation to ensure that we have a fully inclusive society within Northern Ireland. I take note of the right hon. Gentleman's point.<br><br>
As for further and higher education, a centre piece of Government policy throughout the life of this Parliament will be to promote the development of lifelong learning. There are still far too many people
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0658">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
entering the work force who lack qualifications or whose qualifications are inadequate. I praised the Northern Ireland education system earlier, but in that respect it is not adequate. Among the unemployed in Northern Ireland, one third has no formal qualification, which is worse than elsewhere, and of the employed, one fifth has no qualification of any kind. We must put that right by increasing resources and focusing on lifelong learning.<br><br>
We must give a warm welcome in Northern Ireland to the development of the university for industry, which uses technology to bring top-quality training wherever people are.<br><br>
As the first Minister with joint responsibility for the Department of Education and for the Training and Employment Agency, I am in a strong position to ensure that our policy on life-long learning is implemented. We decided immediately that it was absurd that education and training should be separated, with different agencies responsible for them. We are now working together to improve matters.<br><br>
The Training and Employment Agency, in conjunction with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland as elsewhere, is developing the welfare to work, new deal proposals with great enthusiasm and bringing on board many of the major private employers in Northern Ireland. For example, we recently held talks with Hilton Hotels, which is building a new hotel in the centre of Belfast. I am delighted that the company has agreed to be part of the new deal, as have all the major firms in Northern Ireland, as far as I am aware. We shall also work with the voluntary sector and with the public agencies to make a success of the new deal.<br><br>
A problem that was hanging around when the Government came into power was that although in 1992–93, colleges in England and Wales and in Scotland had been put under different control and become free-standing colleges, the Northern Ireland colleges had to cope with uncertainty about their future for five years. The Government ended that uncertainty and Northern Ireland colleges will be free-standing from 1 April. However, there will not be the same emphasis on competition and on taking a cut-throat approach as there was in England and Wales: the colleges in Northern Ireland will be incorporated within a framework of co-operation. They will work with the growing voluntary and community sectors in education, developing a clear-cut role for further education which emphasises the approach which was referred to earlier.<br><br>
We considered the Dearing report on higher education and realised that his recommendations for a tertiary sector fitted Northern Ireland perfectly. The three universities—the Open university, Queen's and the University of Ulster—and the 17 colleges and 10 regional training centres under the Training and Education Agency creates a sector of a size in which institutions can work together well. We are currently considering the Dearing recommendations about how the sector should be administered and led in the future. I am confident that improvements will be made.<br><br>
We have made progress in other areas of my responsibility. One of the most shaming facts that I discovered when I inherited the previous Government's
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
budget was that funding for libraries had been cut by 50 per cent. That demonstrates inappropriate priorities. This year we have managed to find an extra £500,000 for books and next year we intend to put an extra £1.3 million into the library service.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Öpik</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for his magnanimity.

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Obviously, the situation is being monitored. Various discussions about the implementation of the Dearing report are taking place at ministerial level: I cannot give any further detail at the moment, but I shall respond as soon as I can.<br><br>

Now that we know it will be based in Sheffield, our priority is to ensure that some satellite centres, which will be major additions to fostering quality sport in various parts of the United Kingdom, will be placed in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
We have managed to safeguard the budget of the Arts Council this year. I have already had some preliminary discussions with its chairman about identifying priorities for development in the coming months. After a long time, we have also managed to implement the findings of the Wilson report on museums. Three museums—the Ulster Folk and Transport museum, the Ulster museum and the Ulster-American Folk park—are being brought together and I am pleased to announce that a director for the merged museum has been appointed. I look forward to museums having a higher profile in future.<br><br>
I have mentioned only some of the areas of development with which I have been involved over the past few months. I look forward to hearing hon. Members' responses to the enormous programme that I have announced.</span></p>
<p>11.39 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not intend to take up much of the Committee's time, but, I want to focus on one of the key priorities of the Minister's Department. He went part of the way this morning to address that issue—I refer, of course, to the funding of preparatory schools.<br><br>
The Minister has changed some of his earlier proposals, which the Committee should welcome. I certainly welcome the fact that he has moved part of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0659">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 19</span>
way, but I must tell him that his current proposals will not work. He needs to revisit the issue because his anticipated savings will probably not materialise. He could find that taking action to make a saving will land the Department of Education with additional costs. I shall explain that more fully in a moment.<br><br>
The circular sent out to preparatory departments spoke of approximately 3,400 preparatory school pupils. The Minister alluded to the fact that there did not appear to be significant reductions in preparatory school pupil numbers as a result of the previous Government's reduction of subsidy. However, that is not borne out by the evidence from some preparatory schools. For example, Campbell college reported a 25 per cent. reduction in pupil numbers, largely as a result of the reduced subsidy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman mentions Campbell college. Is he asserting that enrolment fell because of a£100 cut in the subsidy for fees? Might it not be associated more with the fact that it costs, on average, about£2,600 to send a pupil there?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: There are obviously several factors to be taken into account. I am simply using the evidence provided by its headmaster, who witnessed a 25 per cent. reduction in pupil numbers and attributed it to increased costs to parents. I am simply passing on information and evidence that the Minister should have taken into account.<br><br>
As the Minister confirmed earlier, the total cost to public funds of preparatory departments is a little less than1.5 million. My figures are based on his previous proposals, so his different set of figures rather threw me. Nevertheless, I have managed to compute the new scenario in reasonable time. He is proposing to reduce the level of subsidy from 40 to 30 per cent. of teaching costs, thereby reducing the £1.5 million subsidy by about £375,000. The total subsidy to preparatory schools will be reduced from £1.5 million to £1,125,000. If £3,400 pupils remain at prep school, the average subsidy per pupil is approximately £330.<br><br>
Let us compare that with the cost to the Minister's Department of a child attending a state primary school. Savings could be made if there were a marginal cost to taking an extra child into a primary school—but there is not. Under local management of schools, each additional child to a primary school commands the necessary funding, which I estimate to be £1,400 per pupil. When an additional child enters a primary school, the school's head and its governing body will insist, under local management of schools, on receiving the additional £1,400. Hence when a child moves from a prep to a state primary school there is that much additional cost to the Minister's Department.<br><br>
The Minister must have examined the figures. He has reduced the subsidy from 40 to 30 per cent.—far greater than his original proposal, which was to wipe it out entirely. He is looking for a threshold, an amount of subsidy at which parents currently paying for their children to attend prep schools will continue to pay. That is a gamble, a high-risk strategy. If the Minister gets it wrong, he not only disrupts the education of
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
hundreds of children; he may cost his Department money. He may make no savings at all.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman assumes that places for pupils are available, but the headmasters and headmistresses whom I brought along to see the Minister reported that only one place in their area was available for any pupils. The Minister will thus face the additional cost of providing new teachers, new classrooms and schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman makes a good point and I was about to come to it. The letter from the Department of Education in Northern Ireland to the preparatory departments states:
<br><blockquote><p>"Given that, in most areas where preparatory departments currently exist, there are adequate places available in existing controlled and maintained primary schools."</p></blockquote>
In east and south Belfast there are no vacancies in the state sector. As the hon. member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson) has said, the Minister may either increase capital costs for additional buildings, the recruitment of additional teachers and the creation of additional places, or he will have to bus children for longer distances and his transport costs will rise. In either case, he faces additional costs in that area alone. I thank the hon. Gentlemen for raising that point as it has enabled me to develop that argument.<br><br>
If the parents of 350 of those 3,400 pupils—that is about 10 per cent.—in private education opt to return their children to the state sector because they are no longer able to make an additional sacrifice, that would wipe out the Minister's£375,000 saving. The Minister is gambling that there will be no transfers because of the levels of support that he has set. I disagree with that. It is not just the extra£100 or so per pupil that would have to be paid by parents; some families have two or more children at preparatory school. There would be an additional burden on those families who wish their children to go to the same school.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that the hon. Gentlemen agrees that if that 10 per cent. of children leave the schools, the schools still have to maintain their staff, outgoings, buildings and so on. The costs must, therefore, be divided among a smaller number of pupils. Costs per pupil would increase and that would cause more to leave, increasing the costs again until eventually the system would collapse.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is another excellent point. If there is pressure on preparatory schools to increase their fees, a downward spiral could develop. Parents would be discouraged from sending their children to those schools and there would be even more transfers to the state sector, not just the 10 per cent. of children who might be transferred because of the current costs. If the Minister does not change his mind, we shall return to this matter time and again to point out that he had plenty of evidence and an ample opportunity to make the right decision.<br><br>
The Minister's officials are giving him bad advice, and it states: it stems from a bald statement on page 8 of the SACHR report.
<br><blockquote><p>"Debate on educational funding is often stifled by warnings of scarce resources. In this context DENI's funding of just under£1.5 million for preparatory schools should cease."</p></blockquote>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0660">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
The context for that statement is that resources were scarce and there was pressure on school budgets. Earlier, the Minister lauded from the rooftops the extra money that his Government have put into education. Why, then, is he following the SACHR recommendations and cutting the subsidy to these schools?<br><br>
The priorities that we are discussing are not related only to the money that is available: over the next few weeks, or months, parents must decide on applications for their children to attend various preparatory schools. They are holding back on those applications because they are uncertain about the future. A present, that is causing administrative chaos in the preparatory schools, but if, as a result of the Minister's decisions, more parents opt for the state sector, there will be a knock-on effect on planning in state primary schools.<br><br>
A few weeks ago at Northern Ireland Questions, I told the Minister that he had got his sums wrong. He will not make any savings. It is economic madness. It is all very well to say that he wants to spend money on pre-school education. That is a laudable aim, but he will not have £300,000-plus to divert from the preparatory school sector.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's point. In the light of the fact that a Conservative Government introduced a policy of including disabled children in mainstream education, how many disabled children will be admitted under the scheme that he has been propounding? Does the relevant head teacher's letter contain numbers relating to mainstream attendance in accordance with the Tory Administration's proposals?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is trying to make a political point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not a political point. I am asking about disabled children.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman is making a political point, which might, when it appears in <i>Hansard</i>, be read as a slur on the governing bodies of preparatory schools in Northern Ireland, with respect to their admissions practice.<br><br>
I do not know how many disabled pupils are at preparatory schools in Northern Ireland. I believe that any child who met the entry requirements would be admitted whatever his or her disability. The hon. Gentleman should refer to the <i>Hansard</i> report of the debate and think carefully about the implications that could be read into his question.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I empathise with the point made by the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien), but is not the obtaining of statements for children who need special education still a slow process? Is the hon. Gentleman aware of concern about the fact that in the integrated—supposedly completely integrated—sector, children are unlikely to be accepted at Lagan college, even though they qualify on other grounds?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That question would be better addressed to the Minister. I know only that huge delays in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
statementing of children occur in my education authority, in the state sector. I cannot believe that Northern Ireland is any better placed in that respect than are local education authorities in England and Wales.<br><br>
I urge the Minister to rethink the matter. He has gone part of the way, but not far enough to be sure of avoiding potential future costs. When the figures are produced, it will be evident that adhering to the option that he presented today will result in such additional costs.</span></p>
<p>11.53 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eddie McGrady <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Down)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In his speech, the Minister ranged over a variety of subjects. The constraints of time enable me to touch only on one or two of those. There is a tendency in Northern Ireland to think that our education system is better, in all quarters, than any elsewhere. The facts do not support that.<br><br>
This month the adult literacy survey conducted for the Department of Education and the Training and Employment Agency published some quite shocking results. Of our adults, 24 per cent. are at the lowest level of achievement, while 30 per cent. are at the second lowest level. Those are daunting statistics and when it is considered that those levels are below those of Great Britain, and that Northern Ireland does not have multilingual problems or the social conditions of many parts of Great Britain, our situation appears worse.<br><br>
Against that backcloth, why does the Minister still intend to cut discretionary awards by 50 per cent., reducing the relevant figure to £4 million? It is estimated that that will leave 1,000 students in Northern Ireland without the funds to pursue further and higher education.<br><br>
The code of practice for special needs education was introduced in Great Britain 24 months ago. It has not yet been published or introduced in Northern Ireland. I wonder why. No strategy seems to have been established in that respect and no funding appears to have been allocated yet.<br><br>
The Minister referred in his speech to nursery education. The Save the Children Fund survey published recently suggested that child poverty in Northern Ireland was the highest in Europe. It is anticipated that 2,200 new nursery places will be provided: the requirement is 16,000 new places. What will happen to the other 13,000 or 14,000 children? When will their problems be tackled?<br><br>
The Minister said that Northern Ireland's teaching force was the envy of much of the rest of the United Kingdom and, indeed, Europe. I fully concur, but that evaluation is not reflected in their salary scales. If we esteem the teachers as much as we say, their reward for their difficult professional endeavours compares badly with that in any other profession. Theirs is one of the only professions—nursing is, I think, the other—with an awarding body whose advice or diktat is not necessarily accepted by Government, but is discretionary.<br><br>
I accept the argument of parental choice and parental demands to which the Minister alluded in his remarks about integrated education. What bothers people in Northern Ireland about integrated education is not its
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0661">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
existence or its promotion by Government, but its privilege. People cannot understand why a new system, which replaces existing systems and buildings, should have ring-fenced, copper-fastened funding; or why it receive preferential treatment for building and equipment provision and teacher-pupil ratios.<br><br>
The Minister said that education should encompass training and employment, and that he was glad it now did so. He said that the Training and Employment Agency was an important factor in youth and adult training. One of the primary agencies for implementing that training has been action for community employment. ACE was consistently cut by the previous Government and it looks as though it will be cut again by the present Government. I find that difficult to accept, because the scheme is innovative. It produces new ideas and practices, and it has a high success rate in getting unskilled people back into the work force, and in job creation. The current uncertainty about the future of the entire ACE scheme has caused an enormous drop in its morale and in its driving force. If the Minister would lay that uncertainty to rest, that would be important. I know that the Government commissioned an evaluation of the ACE programme, to be completed by October 1997, but I do not think that it is complete. If it is, it has not come to my attention.<br><br>
The student funding proposals will have a dramatic effect on the number of students. It will particularly affect the ability of those from socially deprived and poorer backgrounds, to take up the tertiary and further education that is their right. I know that the figures are slightly out of date, but, in 1991, 35 per cent. of Northern Ireland's further education students were from socially and economically deprived backgrounds. They represent an important sector. I hope that the Minister will reconsider the introduction of higher tuition fees. A moratorium to consider the issue further would be desirable.<br><br>
From 1 April next, colleges of further education—what we used to call technical colleges—will be incorporated. I am not sure whether the experience in my area reflects that in the entire Six Counties, but that step will have a detrimental effect on the provision of technical and vocational education. Ironically, East Down institute of further education will be incorporated on 1 April 1998, but it already has a deficit. In company law—I am sure that the hon. and learned Member for North Down will correct me if I am wrong—it is illegal to trade at a deficit. How will the directors of the institute be able to face the registrar of companies when it has a deficit and will knowingly and willingly continue to operate with one when it has no justification in law for doing so?<br><br>
That was an intriguing aside, but the important point is to provide enhanced technical and vocational training for young people. Incorporation will tend to place restrictions on it.<br><br>
Will the Minister consider education in the rural communities, which make up much of Northern Ireland? Schools in the maintained and voluntary sectors have closed. If that fact is contrasted with the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
Government's policy of seeking to sustain rural communities, we find a contradiction.<br><br>
The pivot and focal point of a rural community is its school. It may not enrol many children, but—this is the irony—high educational performances result. Education is not about how many pupils are in the school, but whether they receive a good education. Perhaps it is because of the pupil-teacher ratio that such schools achieve excellent results, yet they are being closed for the sake of a few thousand pounds.<br><br>
When the education boards' proposals for the voluntary and maintained sectors reach the Minister's desk, will he consider carefully a school's provision of education and the Government's policy on rural communities when deciding whether a school should be closed? There is no point in throwing departmental money at other measures to sustain rural communities when their heart is being pulled out.<br><br>
I would like to deal with many other issues but time will not alow me to do so. I may be able to take them up with the Minister on another occasion.</span></p>
<p>12.4 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome you, Mr. Jones, to the Committee.<br><br>
I also welcome the Minister's commitment to raising educational standards in Northern Ireland and his repeated commitment to lifelong learning. It is pleasing to note that, since the Northern Ireland Grand Committee last met in December, the Minister has announced plans to expand pre-school education in the Province. The announcement was welcome. All Northern Ireland Members have received representations over many years from young mothers and fathers who have experienced difficulties in finding nursery places even when they live within 200 yds of a nursery school.<br><br>
I am pleased that the extra £2 million will provide about 2,000 new nursery places in September 1998. Although it is significant increased provision, it builds on a low base. However welcome the additional places are, it is disappointing that they will be targeted on children from socially disadvantaged areas and at the oldest four-year-olds. That is understandable, but Northern Ireland is receiving rationed nursery provision.<br><br>
What would the total demand for nursery school provision be if all parents applied for places for their children? Over what time scale does the Minister aim to provide funding to enable children, whose parents so desire, to benefit from good pre-school education? Provision in Northern Ireland is 60 per cent. of the provision made in Wales and 75 per cent. of that in England. We received no money last year from the voucher scheme; it went to Great Britain.<br><br>
What consideration has the Minister's Department made of the future required expenditure on nursery education that may arise from the allocation of funds from district partnerships to schools to provide new nursery provision? Should not all the district partnerships be required to enter into discussions with area boards and the Department of Education in Northern Ireland before deciding to allocate the funds?<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0662">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
Does the Minister accept that, although the decision to set up pre-school education advisory groups in each education and library board area to plan for pre-school education is a good idea, he may have been ill-advised by his officials on the composition of the groups? Why have elected representatives been denied any direct representation, and why is there no provision for transfer representatives to be appointed to the body? The advisory groups will make recommendations to boards that will involve spending considerable sums. It is disgraceful that there has been positive discrimination against any group. Will the Minister further consider the membership of the groups and what can be done at an early stage to provide additional places?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Shona MeIsaac <span class='memberconstituency'>(Cleethorpes)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note that you said that you were not involved in discussions on pre-school education in Northern Ireland. However, a consultation document on the subject was issued, so you had an opportunity to participate in that. That is how you could have taken up any concerns, but I am glad that you welcome the increased provision. If you read the document, you will see that it states that a 20 per cent. increase is the initial part of the programme. Increased expansion will take place over the years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The Committee will be aware that all hon. Members address the Chair and should address other hon. Members indirectly through the Chair.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although others in Northern Ireland allege that the Unionist community is made up of bigots, it has always tried to treat all sections of the community fairly. That is the reason for my point about pre-school advisory groups. Two significant elements have not been included in he composition of those groups. I do not want to delay their recommendations, but all sections of the community should be properly represented. A deliberate policy exists to deny the right of influence to elected representatives. We represent the most quango-iced area of the United Kingdom. Sometimes we have little opportunity to represent.<br><br>
The Minister should provide additional funding for our colleges and universities to ensure that, as well as the increased provision for nursery school places—I hope that that will be on-going—provision will be made for training. That will ensure that trained teachers and qualified nursery assistants maximise the benefit to the children who obtain nursery places.<br><br>
In the interests of fairness, justice and principle, I must return to the subject of preparatory schools. Parents of preparatory school pupils have already contributed through income tax to the cost of their children's education. They currently pay 60 per cent. of teacher costs. Further reduction of support by the Department of Education will lead to a fall in demand for places, and higher costs, which will drive people elsewhere and may lead to the closure of schools. There is no evidence to show that parents of children who lose their preparatory school places, or are forced to move away, will be able to choose their nearest controlled school, integrated school or maintained school.<br><br>
Preparatory schools have always been truly integrated across the community. I ask those who
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
contributed to the cut in resources whether the parents of preparatory school children should have rights that are at least equal to those of parents who choose alternative schooling on religious, cultural or integration grounds. The majority of elected Members from Northern Ireland believe that there should be no further cut in funding for preparatory schools.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I note the hon. Gentleman's point about funding. We must accept that only a certain amount of money is available for education. The remit of the motion for the debate is so wide that we can discuss any subject that is relevant to education. Therefore, does the hon. Gentleman accept that the hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) made an important point about statemented children? Would not it be better to use money for education to help children who have special educational needs? If so, we should press the Minister to take more money from preparatory schools to help children with special needs. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that is sensible?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Special needs education in Northern Ireland requires significant additional funding. However, we get such a good bargain in contributing only£400 per preparatory school pupil that we should hold on to it. Why should we create a situation in which we may have to pay £1,400 per pupil elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about special education?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Special education is a serious matter, and expenditure on it in Northern Ireland has gone up significantly. It has nearly doubled over the past six or seven years. Now with the introduction of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order and parents' rights to demand statements, the pressure on the education and library boards to satisfy the identified needs will increase the cost of providing for children with special needs.<br><br>
I have always said, and I repeat, that the sooner we identify the individual needs of a child, the sooner we can maximise help to redress its disadvantage. We cannot delay additional funding specifically to meet the extra costs that have arisen from changes brought about by the children order and the demand that now arises because of children's special needs.<br><br>
I welcome the announcement that every school and college will have an opportunity to be linked to the information superhighway, but the problem of the past is still there. Under their local management of budgets, schools are left to pick up the costs. Just as the children order was introduced and there was no announcement by the previous Government of any additional funding to help increased costs, we have had the announcement—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Ms Margaret Moran <span class='memberconstituency'>(Luton, South)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hope that the hon. Gentleman will join me in welcoming the initiative to introduce information technology to the classroom. Is he aware that in many areas, and I am sure that Northern Ireland is no exception, cable companies such as NTL Cabletel, which operates in Northern Ireland as it does in my constituency, have installed cabling in schools? They have offered inexpensive deals to enable them to use information technology in an extremely productive way that suits the whole school curriculum. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0663">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
am taking advantage of that in my constituency and I hope that other hon. Members will do the same in theirs.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention. There is no doubt that opportunities will be taken up in Northern Ireland. We look forward to the low-cost rates that are being offered. This is a new development. There will be additional costs. Additional funding must be made available to the boards for redirection to LMS budgets so that school governors and principals are comfortable maximising and managing the new arrangement.<br><br>
Major investment is needed for new equipment in all areas of information technology in our schools and for the administration of education services. Much of our equipment is obsolete and will have to be replaced. We have to plan for that and it should be done now. I was pleased to attend with some of my hon. Friends the inaugural meeting between the Sports Council for Northern Ireland and Members of Parliament. I noted that in his foreword to the "Strategy for the Development of Sport in Northern Ireland 1997–2005" the Minister said:
<br><blockquote><p>"We now need the key players, whether they be statutory or voluntary to unite to put the strategy into practice."</p></blockquote>
Will he take the lead on that? He has intimated that we are to get a new specialist provision in Northern Ireland as we have been missing out on facilities for national competitions. Northern Ireland has no budget for that of which I am aware. England, Scotland and Wales have nine national sports centres of excellence in addition to national stadiums and a growing stock of indoor arenas, but they still budget to press ahead. If we have to depend on 2.8 per cent. lottery funding to provide facilities in Northern Ireland we will never have them.<br><br>
My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, South questioned the Scottish Office Minister for Education and Industry about the funding of Northern Ireland students on four-year courses at Scottish universities. We would all like an assurance from the Minister that if Northern Ireland students are accepted on a four-year course their tuition fees for that time will be met by the Department of Education in Northern Ireland in the same way as resident Scottish students are funded.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Ross <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Londonderry)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can tell my hon. Friend that some courses last four and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can ask only for parity. The announcement concerned four-year tuition fees. If we get that it will be progress. There is also the problem of the added costs of students in medical and veterinary courses. They have no opportunity to work part time or to raise any funds to meet their costs. Some allowance should be made for them.</span></p>
<p>12.22 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Following the comments of the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs), I should like to raise the issue of sport in Northern Ireland, which is one of the Minister's responsibilities at the Department of Education. Representatives of the Sports Council for Northern
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
Ireland met hon. Members in the House this week. One of the issues that they raised which disturbed us all was that although at one stage the Council had been allocated about£4 million a year towards capital funding in sport, the Department of Education had intimated that when the lottery came along it would be additional. Now it gets about £100,000 a year from the Department and the lottery is asked to provide the rest.<br><br>
Effectively the Government have robbed the people of Northern Ireland of capital funding for sport and asked the lottery to take up the slack. While the lottery in Northern Ireland is worth about £7 million to8 million, because of the requirements to allocate funding to UK schemes, there is only about –3.5 million available for capital schemes in Northern Ireland. The small amount that trickles out of the Department of Education and the money that is available from the lottery add up to less than the amount over the past 10 years from the Department for sport in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
In our part of the United Kingdom sport has been an important factor in improving community relations. People from both sides of our community have been comfortable coming together to engage in various sports. Regrettably, some sports in Northern Ireland seek to exclude people, but by and large sport in Northern Ireland has been an inclusive means of bringing people from the two communities together.<br><br>
It is rather sad that in a part of the United Kingdom that has a lower level of provision, there is no national facility. There is no 50m swimming pool in Northern Ireland, but many parts of the United Kingdom have such a facility. Northern Ireland is sadly behind in that respect because a 50m pool would cost about8 million to £10 million, which is an excessive amount in relation to the available funds.<br><br>
A full-size pool would take the three years' lottery funding that is available to the Province and would require the Minister to act. I understand that he has been approached by the Sports Council in relation to a proposal to take a top slice of lottery funding from each of the home countries, which would go into the United Kingdom's Sports Council allocation. The allocation would be on a United Kingdom-wide basis, but it could assist Northern Ireland as the overall pot would be so much greater. I hope that the Minister will take that on board and press his hon. Friends in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to take steps to assist Northern Ireland in that respect.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman emphasise that the need is so great that approximately £140 million is needed to provide Northern Ireland with facilities that are comparable to those elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I suppose that I should have declared a slight interest as a member of the Sports Council for Northern Ireland, but as it is an unpaid position I did not bother. However, the Minister is aware of it.<br><br>
Our demands are much more modest than £140 million. It is reckoned that about £24.3 million will be required in the next few years for what the Sports Council considers to be a major priority. About 9 million could come from other sources, thus all that we require from the Minister is £15 million. He has a smile

on his face, which suggests that he will take that on board.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about funding for prep schools?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robinson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Since the Minister encourages me to speak about prep schools I shall do so.<br><br>
Aid is to be cut by a quarter, from 40 per cent. to 30 per cent. That is better than reducing it to 20 per cent., as was suggested; it might even allow one or two prep schools to remain open. But the cut is not an economically sensible decision. Some might suggest that the Minister should go back to school and do his sums again; it is clear that he will have to take note of several matters in the next 12 months.<br><br>
The facts are as follows: the Minister provides about £400 for each pupil who goes to a preparatory school. It goes to the Department, not directly to the pupils, but the effect is the same. I understand that the Minister wrote today to preparatory school head teachers stating that the proposal would save £250,000, and taking account of the fact that some people will drop off the preparatory school lists as a result of the cut. My calculation, which is similar to that quoted earlier, is that the cut from 40 per cent. to 30 per cent. is likely to save £375,000. The Minister has acknowledged that more than 100 pupils will be affected by his decision.<br><br>
I suggest that the Minister has miscalculated. Although some schools have high fees—the Minister mentioned Cabin Hill, which is the preparatory department of Campbell college—the burden on parents is such that it takes only a little more expense to persuade parents' not to continue to send their children to preparatory schools. That applies especially if they have several children at prep schools. The Minister will recall a delegation led by my hon. Friend and me, in which there was a low to middle-ranking civil servant who had several children at preparatory schools. If the fees went up by £50 or £100, he simply could not afford that.<br><br>
Many people will be in that position. The cut will cause hardship to some, but for others it will be the straw that breaks the camel's back. If that happens to a significant extent, the scenario presented by the hon. and learned Member for North Down is likely to occur: the schools' costs which remain constant, will have to be shared by a smaller number of pupils and the fees paid by parents will have to increase to such an extent that more pupils will fall out of the system. It will therefore not be long before the sector collapses. If that takes place, on the basis of the Minister's calculations it will require only 220 more pupils to move out of the preparatory departments for the Minister to lose money.<br><br>
The Minister's proposal is a false economy and he should reconsider it. The impact of his decision on preparatory schools should be closely monitored in the next 12 months and if the effect is as we predict, and there are fewer schools with preparatory departments, at the end of that period, he should be prepared to reverse his decision.<br><br>
It was said earlier that there had been a 25 per cent. reduction in the number of pupils attending Campbell college. Many other preparatory schools have also suffered because of the Conservative Government'
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
decision to reduce aid to 40 per cent. Those whose numbers did not decrease were cursed, too: they were expecting an increase because they had extended their preparatory departments. Bloomfield Collegiate school, for example, said that it was ready to deal with an expansion in preparatory education but because of the reduction in aid to 40 per cent. that sector remained constant and did not expand as expected. The previous cuts had an effect and so will this one.<br><br>
I accept the comments on intregrated education, although the Minister did not. What was said applies equally to the Roman Catholic education system. The Department does not say, "People who want their children to be educated in schools with a special ethos should be given 30 per cent. of the funding." The Minister is content to allow 100 per cent. funding in Roman Catholic schools and for integrated education when parents decide that that is what they want. It is their right to choose—indeed I encourage it. None of my children went through the normal educational system and they have all been a burden to my pocket in that respect. I choose not to drink Bushmills and smoke Gallaher's Blues but to spend the money on education, as is the right of any parent. The Minister should not take away my right to choose simply because I am prepared to pay a bit extra to ensure that my children are educated within the ethos that I choose.<br><br>
The Minister should not assume that people are not entitled to choice because they are prepared to pay for it. That is a ludicrous argument. If there is to be no reduction in aid to those in integrated and Roman Catholic education, the Minister should also allow those perks to people who want their children to be educated in a special type of school with a particular ethos. Those parents should have the same rights as those of other pupils, because they pay twice for their children's education—first as taxpayers and then as feepayers. What the Minister is proposing is morally wrong.<br><br>
The proposal is wrong-headed; it will not work. The Minister should have grasped the nettle. When he came into Parliament he thought that there was a cause to be fought by those with a socialist background, but that is not the case. He does nothing for the socialist cause by hammering preparatory schools. The issue should not be considered in that way. The Minister's proposal will cost the Department about £3 million, instead of saving £250,000. The rest of the education sector will not thank him for that because he will have to find that money from elsewhere in his budget.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony McWalter <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hemel Hempstead)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to speak about integrated education—as hon. Members might expect—which has had rather a hard time in our debate this morning. The subject is something of a minefield.<br><br>
I accept that there has been substantial under-investment in the plant and buildings of many schools in Northern Ireland. The Government must show all the people of Northern Ireland that they understand that, and that they want to make appropriate and extensive provision for improving the schools to which parents choose to send their children. We should not overlook the huge amount of work in education for mutual

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
understanding. Many schools and organisations such as Co-operative North are promoting that and are trying to ensure that there is real understanding of other communities and other cultural traditions.<br><br>
The current arrangements for integrated education are unsatisfactory because they create too great a barrier to an effective system. We should remember that increasingly there are many parents who want their children not only to learn about other cultures, but also to mix more regularly with people from those cultures. That social dimension is a crucial ingredient in the educational agenda. On 24 August last year <i>The Sunday Times</i> published an article entitled, "Out of the mouths of babes". Declan, from the Falls road, was reported as saying,
<br><blockquote><p>"I wanted to go to this new school"—</p></blockquote>
the Malone college, in south Belfast—
<br><blockquote><p>"because I would like to learn more about different religions and see what people are really like. At a Catholic school in my own area I wouldn't get to know new people and not many people round here like Protestants. Round here they throw bricks at the police."</p></blockquote>
Heather, who lives in the Shankill, said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Here a lot of people call Catholics names and say bad things about them. I want to mix with people at school, not just stick to my own religion and know nothing about anyone else."</p></blockquote>
The school system is not only about learning from teachers, parents and local communities; it is also about learning from other students and from those from other communities. Many people would be hard put to say that the facilities for that are as extensive as they should be in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
In 1981, Lagan college began with 28 pupils. If the current criteria governing acceptability for any new initiatives were in place, Lagan college would not have had a chance—we have already heard that access for disabled people is difficult. It is now one of the most successful schools in the United Kingdom and there is great interest in its activities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate that Lagan college has been built up under favoured conditions? It has free travel, even within the three-mile limit. It cannot now take pupils with special educational needs, which is contrary to its agenda.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McWalter</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that. There are many defects in the integrated sector, not least that about 85 per cent. of it is located in portakabins. That makes it difficult for those schools to provide conventional facilities for their students.<br><br>
I also accept that there has been major differential funding because of the political impetus behind the integrated education movement. It is still small, however, with fewer than 9,000 pupils. Many people within the sector, and others who want it to grow and flourish—perhaps through transformation or through the adoption of new schools—will feel disappointed by the Minister's fleeting remarks today. For instance, the most recent report of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education states that the Labour Administration, with its previously stated concern about Department of Education accountability and the changes of minimalist transformation criteria, has created new expectations.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
Those minimalist transformation criteria refer to the fact that a school can be regarded as integrated if no more than 10 per cent. of the pupils are from an opposing tradition. Such a school would be dominated by one tradition. The Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education had every right to expect that that would change; not necessarily by a return to the imposition of the 30 per cent. criteria, but perhaps by looking favourably on attempts to make do with fewer than 100 pupils in the first instance. I hope that the Minister will recognise that the 100 pupil criterion is a considerable barrier to new initiatives and that perhaps the 10 per cent. criterion is too low to provide pupils with the integrated education that their parents want to see.<br><br>
I hope that the remarks of Declan and Heather will remind us that children have a right to an educational agenda that goes beyond our cultural background as parents. There is still too little emphasis on that form of educational provision.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Cecil Walker <span class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the Government's proposals for the expansion of further and higher education in Northern Ireland. The Minister mentioned the Dearing report. I look forward to its implementation with regard to the amalgamation of further and higher education in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I supported the idea, suggested by the University of Ulster, of a university campus at Springvale, but I understand that the university has abandoned it. There is now a joint proposal by the University of Ulster and the Belfast Institute of Further and Higher Education for educational provision on that site. I support that because it facilitates the seamless progression from further to higher education. I agree that many benefits to my constituents and the people of Belfast would result from the university and BIFHE working together.<br><br>
In considering the sort of provision that is envisaged for the site, I support a BIFHE community education centre, which would serve the area where the site is based, and would act as headquarters for community education in Belfast. I also support a University of Ulster research centre. Those two centres would be ideal for the site. I hope that the Government will instil some confidence into the area by putting bricks and mortar there. Building such centres on the site would provide a marvellous opportunity for the people of Belfast.<br><br>
Millfield college has contributed so much throughout our troubles to providing education in Belfast. Its central location wold be ideal for joint University of Ulster and BIFHE teaching provision for further and higher education. I have written to the Minister about that, and I would welcome an opportunity to discuss it further.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I should like to talk about integrated education, to which the hon.

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mr. McWalter) referred. I support the concept of integrated education when its objective is to bring people together, share different ideas and create mutual understanding. However, I have reservations about the motivation behind much of what is described as integrated education.<br><br>
Lagan college was established not because those who inspired its creation were particularly motivated by bridging the community divide, but because they believed that their children had much in common socially. It was set up by middle-class parents who had not succeeded in the transfer scheme and preferred their little Catholic Declan to go to school with little Protestant Heather in a suitable social environment. They were not primarily interested in bridging communal differences. They were brought together by what they had in common, which was not the resolution of communal differences, but the affirmation of social status. Such attitudes are endemic in the thrust for integrated education, which has been supported by the Conservative Government and the Labour Government on the basis that it constitutes a form of social engineering that will solve all our problems. That is far from being the case.<br><br>
I was approached by the headteacher of a Catholic school in my constituency. Forty-five per cent. of her pupils were Protestant; many of them were the children of members of the security forces. It was a perfect example of organic integration. The school opposed a proposal for a new orthodox integrated school in Strangford simply because the funds for capital school buildings, teaching and transport to the new integrated school would have destroyed not only its funding, but that of many others in North Down. The then Minister rejected the proposal and the rejection has continued under this Government. The Minister's attitude to integrated education has been responsible. He has placed the right emphasis on transformation rather than the creation of de novo schools. That attitude should be encouraged.<br><br>
There are approximately 22,000 non-Scottish students at Scottish universities, of whom 25 per cent.—more than 5,000—are from Northern Ireland. Many students from Northern Ireland go to those universities because of their location and their ambience. However, many go there because 12,000 university places are missing in Northern Ireland. In Wales, 5,000 places are missing. Having failed to provide sufficient places in Northern Ireland, it is discriminatory and unfair for students to have to complete a four-year course, the system which is de rigueur in Scotland, and to require them to pay for the fourth year. Funding will be available for non-Scottish students for only three years. I hope that the Minister will consider that problem carefully.</span></p>
<p>12.52 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It has been an interesting debate, and I welcome that.<br><br>
On the hon. and learned Gentleman's final point, I recognise that Northern Ireland students go to universities elsewhere in the United Kingdom because
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
of the shortage of places in Northern Ireland. The Government shall make that issue a priority.<br><br>
I am sure that hon. Members from Great Britain will have been amazed by the amount of time that has been taken up debating preparatory departments. That is interesting. The only children in Northern Ireland in whom the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire is interested are the 3,000 who go to preparatory departments. He said nothing else about education.<br><br>
The remarks of hon. Member for Belfast, East contained a contradiction. When we met the delegation, the hon. Gentleman the the hon. and learned Member for North Down pressed for an early decision. We have taken that early decision as promised. Today, the hon. Gentleman asked me to reconsider and to keep the issue open. However, a decision has been made, and the uncertainty has ended. That is the position.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Down, like other hon. Members, referred to the expansion of nursery provision. Of course we want to go further, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider the logistics of expanding by more than 20 per cent. in a eight-to-nine month period, which is what we are doing. It is a considerable step forward, but one of our manifesto commitments is to go further.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Down also referred to ACE schemes and commitment to adults. I point out that we are putting £114 million of welfare-to-work money to deal with the issue of 18 to 24-year-olds. That is a substantial commitment, and our priority is to that age group. However, we recognise the need to deal with, and we are moving on, the issue of unemployed over 25-year-olds. Proposals will come forward shortly. The hon. Gentleman referred to the success of the ACE scheme. Some people would say that it has been successful, and in some cases that is true. It is a mixed scheme, however, and it does not have universal approval. It needs to be looked at, and that is what we are doing.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman also mentioned education in rural communities, and I take his point. We are thinking about commonality of funding and trying to establish appropriate criteria and the yardsticks by which schools are funded. A rural school will incur greater costs than an urban one, particularly in terms of size—one of the most important criteria for funding schools. Rural schools should benefit.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs) raised many points. I cannot deal with all of them now but I shall write to all members of the Committee whose questions have not been answered. Regarding the information super-highway, I invite the hon. Gentleman to meet Mr. Topping, the chief executive of the North-Eastern education and library board, who has led the way in Northern Ireland in linking schools to the information technology highway.<br><br>
We provided extra money in this year's budget for equipment and our strategy of liaison with major companies will largely solve the problem of obsolete equipment. More money is coming from the national lottery to fund the training of teachers and librarians. I repeat my request for the hon. Gentleman to meet Mr. Topping and discuss his report.</span></p>

<p><span class='member'>Mr. Worthington</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will not give way because I have only four minutes left.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Belfast, East mentioned sports. We recognise the problem associated with the national lottery and the 2.8 per cent. funding. However, the hon. Gentleman must recognise that colleagues in Great Britain may need to be persuaded that it is occasionally appropriate for Northern Ireland to have more than it pro rata share. We are certainly adopting that policy for satellite centres. The lottery does not often yield major capital projects, which is why we have to deal with the problem. I am fully apprised of the issue.<br><br>
I have met the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker) and would be delighted to meet him again to discuss Springvale. I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead that there is sympathy within our party for integrated education. However, I ask him to bear in mind the conflict between the two parts of his statement. First, he pointed out the substantial capital underinvestment in the Northern Ireland system. Secondly, he asked me to provide more capital for brand new schools, which is a substantial problem.<br><br>
I have to be fair to the professed wishes of the whole population. One section of the population cannot be given precedence in statute over others. Parental wishes are important. I am analysing what criteria are appropriate for the setting up of integrated schools. Any parent's criteria for any school would be the same everywhere. I must continue to be as fair as I can on that matter.<br><br>
We have had an interesting debate, although we may not have spent as much time as we should on capital expenditure. We have to address a substantial problem on that front. Some private finance initiatives should be proposed soon. I should like to express my gratitude to right hon. and learned members of the Committee. I hope that we have another debate shortly.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
Ireland after just a week. As he will recall, my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) raised many of the relevant matters on 21 January. Our decision to return to the subject is a reflection of people's deep concern about the running of prisons and the accountability of the people who manage them, both to the people of Northern Ireland and the House.<br><br>
The prisons in question have a long history of problems. There is no question about that. Hon. Members will recall the fierce contest of will over the demands of the hunger strikers and those who engaged in the dirty protests. I need not go into the details of those demands, though I remember them clearly. The convicted prisoners who took part in those affairs did so to gain certain privileges. If we compare conditions in the prisons now with those prevailing at the time, it is clear that much of—in some ways more than—what they demanded has been granted. There has been a steady retreat from the standards set at he time by Mrs. Thatcher's Government, which were defended, literally to the death, by prison officers, 29 of whom died. That ground has largely been surrendered.<br><br>
The prisoners made their demands because they wanted prisoner of war status. They were trying to avoid facing the true nature of their crimes. If they are allowed to behave differently from other people in prison, they can justify to themselves their murders, their bombs, the intimidation, arson, and all the other hideous crimes that they have committed. If they were not allowed special treatment they would eventually have to face the fact that in a country where everyone has the right to vote there is no excuse for such violence aimed at political and constitutional change, and that they are not soldiers but thugs and murderers, as the rest of society recognises them to be.<br><br>
The IRA above all others is unwilling to make that psychological leap. It is only by forcing people to confront the nature of their crimes and the falseness of the reasoning on which they based them, that we shall begin to gain control of the situation in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I recognise the serious dangers to prison officers. They are dealing with dangerous, fanatical men and women and the Prison Service has paid a high price for that fact, because of the demands of the terrorist organisations. A clear consequence of the prisoners' behaviour is the provision of the resources—men and money—necessary to ensure the creation and maintenance of normal prison regimes in Northern Ireland. That means that the cost of a prisoner in Northern Ireland is sky high compared to that elsewhere. It is an inevitable consequence of a terrorist war.<br><br>
Prison officers are not convinced that sufficient resources have been deployed, or that those that have been expended have always been used to the best advantage. As the Minister knows, 400 prison officer jobs have disappeared in recent years. I appreciate that the number of prisoners has declined as well, but the number of dangersous prisoners has not declined by that much. Prison officers felt that if a choice had to be made between keeping prison officers in position or providing prisoners with perks, officers' jobs would go. That is
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0668">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
one of the reasons why the watchtower was not manned on the day that William Wright was murdered.<br><br>
If the watchtower had been manned, it would have been a push-button job, one the murderers had appeared on the roof, to warn the people bringing Wright out. The watchtower was not manned, the alarm was not given and Wright died. I shall return to the consequences of that.<br><br>
Misuse of resources also extends to the interesting concessions given to convincts. As my hon. Friend the Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) has revealed, the concessions include the provision of stainless steel cutlery to prisoners in the Maze. That concession is give to no other prisoner in the United Kingdom. Indeed, the idea of providing such people with steel knives and forks is one that would amaze most people serving in the prison service elsewhere. Such articles can easily be turned into deadly offensive weapons. That is why prisoners in other prisons get plastic knives and forks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Trimble <span class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend might be interested to learn that when the issue was raised with the Secretary of State and the director of the Prison Service, it was asked, "What's wrong with giving them metal knives? They have got plenty of Stanley knives and other sharp instruments in the wings already.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That information was not revealed to me, but it does not surprise me. One expects it given the situation in the Maze.<br><br>
Most people were stunned at the scenes of the Maze that appeared on our television screens. The Minister has his arms crossed, which is always a sign of a defensive posture. The scenes were shown across the United Kingdom and everyone was amazed. Each prisoner had his own television set in his cell. That may be the standard of comfort that is available to all prisoners in the Maze. If it is, there will be a rush of people of get into the place. Newspaper cartoonists had a field day. I hope that the Minister looked at the cartoons and took account of the concerns that they so vividly revealed.<br><br>
Certain events in recent weeks have concerned people in Northern Ireland. The first is the escape of Liam Averill, who butchered two of my constituents in the town of Garvagh. That was an interesting case. Many other people were arrested, but they got off for one reason or another. One of them was not even prosecuted because he was suffering from mental trauma after being caught up as a possible victim of an Ulster Volunteer Force attack that led to quite a massacre in Castlerock a year or two earlier. I shall leave that person aside because he was not prosecuted. Averill was, however: he went to prison and he has got out.<br><br>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley said in detail last week, Averill's escape appears to have been due to a considerable relaxation in the rules governing prison visits to Christmas parties for children. I have been told that remand prisoners are normally entitled to three half-hour visits a week and that sentenced prisoners are entitled to one half-hour visit a week. In the Maze, the control on visits meant
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
that remand prisoners had visits lasting up to one and a half hours and sentenced prisoners received much longer visits than they were entitled to. Prisoners were also sending out their visiting tickets .and visitors were turning up at short notice, thus creating great problems for the prison staff. As a result, the observers had to be brought down from the watch-towers at various times on Saturdays.<br><br>
At Christmas three parties were held for the benefit of the prisoners. As it happens, each paramilitary group had it own party or perhaps more than one. Not only did the children come along in anything from nappies up, but the spouses and female partners also attended. The cost of those parties to the Exchequer was about £7,000. I also understand that when the women and children were entering the prison, they did not have to go through the normal search procedure but instead used a side gate. They were given a very light frisking on the way in—frisking is the legal term for being patted down. They brought their prams and buggies with them. The prison, however, has a supply of prams, cots and buggies to bring children in and out, because someone, some place, had recognised the danger of allowing people to bring in their own. What happened on that day was a clear breach of the normal procedure.<br><br>
It has been alleged to me that Averill had his visit the day before the party in his own block. I think that he attended a party in another block—his wife certainly did. She therefore had a chance to observe how things were handled throughout the party visit. Given that Averill was dressed as a woman to escape, we can safely assume that a visiting woman dropped the clothing into the prison. There was no other way of getting it in. It is also highly probable that the pistols used to kill Wright were brought into the prison the same way.<br><br>
It is not the first time that IRA women have carried weapons or guns. Many years ago, a member of the security forces was murdered on the walls of Londonderry and the police found out afterwards that the rifle used to kill him was folded up and taken away under a baby in a pram. Let no one say that my suggestion is an insult to women. Those women are fanatics. They brought that stuff in to Averill. I also understand that the make up and all the rest of the props for the characters in the children's party were supplied by the prison.<br><br>
The pistols brought in were a derringer, which is small, light and easily concealed, and a .38 automatic, which is a very substantial gun that would have shown up on an X-ray had one been taken at any point. It was not. We all know how the machines at airports go mad if people go through them with keys or change in their pockets. If those people had been put through the proper search procedure those guns would not have got in.<br><br>
In addition, the counting of prisoners and visitors was inadequate. I am informed that often when prisoners want to confuse the prison officers they come in a rush. The only way to control them is by putting them through a turnstile. Why was that not done? Why are there not turnstiles to control not only the prisoners but the women and children who visit so that, having shown up, they can be counted?<br><br>

My hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley covered the murder of Wright and many of the relevant details during his Adjournment debate a week ago. I am trying to avoid the issues which he mentioned. I was not impressed with the Minister's response to that debate. The Prison Officers Association told him of their concern about Wright's safety. The Minister will recall that the meeting was attended not only by Members of the Northern Ireland prison officers committee but by the chairman and general secretary of the POA from England. He will also recall that Mr. Shannon was in attendance.<br><br>
Those warnings were repeated by the prison officers to the governor of the prison on 24 October and the names of the three they suspected were going to murder Wright were also told to him. The first meeting took place on 1 July.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is my hon. Friend aware that two of the three Irish National Liberation Army prisoners who murdered Billy Wright in the Maze prison had been involved in a serious assault on a prison officer in Maghaberry Prison on 1 April 1996? No charges were brought against them. The same two prisoners were involved in another incident on 29 April 1997. They held a prison officer hostage for several hours with a 9mm pistol and a zip gun that had been smuggled into Maghaberry prison. The security governor of that prison sent a recommendation to the Maze prison on the transfer of those prisoners stating that they should be kept apart. He said that they had made verbal statements—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. The hon. Gentleman knows that interventions should be brief.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am coming to the end of my remarks, Mr. Jones. The prisoners had made verbal statements that they intended to murder Billy Wright in the Maze prison.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ross</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I did not know all those details, but I knew most of them. Such a mountain of information exists that the incident cannot be covered up. We will return to the subject again and again.<br><br>
Little was done to protect Wright or the prison buildings. The roof is acknowledged to be the most vulnerable point in any prison. My hon. Friend the Member for Lagan Valley may know that three recommendations to secure the roof were made. All were refused on grounds of cost, despite a health and safety report in 1995, which stated that roofs had to be secured to keep prisoners off them for the safety of the staff.<br><br>
We are considering serious allegations. Wright's murder led to at least four murders of Roman Catholics. Four members of that faith were murdered last week, but those events were more to do with creating pure terror and the perpetrators' perceptions of the Government's political machinations than with the Wright murder. The murders began with that of Wright. On the same day, Seamus Dillon was killed in Dungannon by the Loyalist Volunteer Force. On 31
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 40</span>
December, Edmund Treanor was killed at the Clifton tavern in Belfast. The LVF claimed responsibility, but the police blamed the Ulster Freedom Fighters. On 11 January, the LVF killed Terence Enright in Belfast; on 18 January, Fergal McCusker was killed in Maghera and, again, the LVF claimed responsibility. The next day, the only Protestant killed this month was murdered. On the same day, another Roman Catholic was killed in Belfast. The LVF claimed responsibility. He was the first among Brennan, Hughes, Conway and McColgan to be murdered. I do not believe that those murders are connected to the Wright murder, but to the perpetrators' perception of events.<br><br>
The inquiries are inadequate. Mr. Neirey's original terms of referance were to inquire into Averill's escape. They later included arrangements for visitors. After Wright's murder, he was asked to examine the circumstances surrounding it. Sir David Ramsbotham is to carry out a full inspection, but that is to be a normal inspection such as that undertaken in any prison in England. I was told that he was to visit the Maze on 23 January, but he will not do that until March, after Mr. Neirey reports.<br><br>
I have many anxieties about prisons in Northern Ireland, not least about the background of senior officials. One came from a compensation agency, one has a civil service background. The former chief executive, Mr. Lewis, who came from a television company, left after the escape from Whitemoor. After that incident he was replaced by a prison governor. I hope that the same will happen in Northern Ireland and that there will be a full-blown, sworn inquiry, because what has been going on smacks to all my hon. Friends of a whitewash.</span></p>
<p>1.20 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) said, this is the second debate in about a week on the subject. Unfortunately, it will be hard in the time available to deal with all the points that the hon. Gentleman raised; he has left me about eight minutes to respond to many detailed points.<br><br>
I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on obtaining the time for the debate; it is an important issue. He raised several allegations about events at the Maze, pursuant to the Billy Wright murder and the Liam Averill escape. I have said before—and I think that this is the proper approach—that any allegations should be backed up by those making them and presented to the inquiry. Although it is useful to hear the allegations in this Room, it is much more important that their substance should be communicated to those conducting the inquiry.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) raised with the Secretary of State some of the complaints that the hon. Member for East Londonderry has made, and received a detailed letter from her on 7 January, rebutting many of the points, but also placing some of them in the context of the need for a proper investigation by Mr. Neirey and Her Majesty's inspector of prisons, alongside the Royal Ulster Constabulary investigation of the Billy Wright murder. We should remember that a murder investigation is

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
under way, and that that restricts Minister's and, I suggest, other hon. Members', capacity to comment. Such comments might prejudice the outcome of the investigation.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised other issues on which I should like to comment, concerning the Prison Service in Northern Ireland generally. Many of its achievements go unnoticed in the publicity surrounding such high-profile incidents as have occurred in the past few weeks. Many day-to-day achievements more truly reflect the difficult work facing those employed in Northern Ireland prisons.<br><br>
The hon. Member for East Londonderry said that people in the Prison Service have an unenviable task. However, it is worth pointing out that no other prison service in the democratic world faces the difficulty that confronts all the Northern Ireland Prison Service, but particularly that at the Maze. It must accommodate more than 500 dedicated terrorists, who, despite being convicted of criminal offences such as murder, armed robbery and other acts of violence, consider themselves as political prisoners or prisoners of war. Those terrorist prisoners are in five groupings, each with its unique agenda and links to local communities that provide support. Those groups can attract immediate political and media attention and, as events have shown, become the focus of wider civil disturbance.<br><br>
There is no option to disperse those prisoners to other parts of the prison estate. For good operational reasons they are concentrated in one prison where they will always pose unique problems of security and control.<br><br>
Terrorists are not the only prisoners catered for by the Northern Ireland Prison Service. There are between 1,500 and 1,600 prisoners in Northern Ireland, all of whom need to be managed and dealt with. That figure compares to an all-time high of 3,000. If I get time, I shall comment on the staffing issues that the hon. Member for East Londonderry raised.<br><br>
The Prison Service has objectives for all prisoners for which it is responsible. Those aims concern not only secure and humane confinement but reducing the risk of reoffending. Prison Service objectives relate to providing the necessities of life: accommodation, food, exercise, health care, work, education, training, hobbies, sport and the freedom to practice religion. They are designed to help prisoners to retain links with their families and to prepare for release. They are aimed at treating prisoners as individuals and offering them the opportunity to serve their sentence free from paramilitary influence. Those objectives are also about trying to enhance the morale of staff through training, management and the appropriate conditions of service. All of those must be achieved with economy and efficiency and within allocated resources.<br><br>
I remind the hon. Member for East Londonderry of the significant recent changes that have been made by the Northern Ireland Prison Service, to which he alluded. Prison regimes have developed considerably in Northern Ireland in recent years. New prison rules have been introduced governing all aspects of the prison environment. Temporary release schemes have been expanded and compassionate home leave, to help prisoners and their families to cope with personal crises, is available in a wider range of circumstances. Those
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
changes have been welcomed within the Prison Service, by those who have to manage the system and to work with prisoners, by prisoners' families, by those who act on behalf of them and by the prisoners themselves.<br><br>
Many hon. Members from Northern Ireland have expressed interest in individual cases over the years and I hope that they will endorse my view that the response of the prison services to those inquiries is professional and helpful. That is important, because hon. Members have the right to raise matters concerning individual constituents and others about what happens in prison. We have introduced a range of changes in the management of the Prison Service to try to help prisoners and their families. Release leave has been increased, especially for those serving longer sentences. The time-served qualifying period for Christmas and summer home leave has been reduced and the length of the leave period has been extended.<br><br>
All those schemes assist prisoners to maintain links with their families and to prepare them for release into the community. Obstacles to the transferring of prisoners in the United Kingdom have largely been removed, allowing many more prisoners to serve their sentences nearer to their families. Despite the crimes that many prisoners have committed, I hope that hon. Gentlemen recognise the importance of taking a humane approach and bringing prisoners closer to their families.<br><br>
There have been other progressive developments in the prisons. Many initiatives have been taken to reduce the risk of prisoners reoffending. It is important that the Prison Service should try to ensure that those who are in prison, whatever crime they have committed, do not reoffend on release. That is one of the Prison Service's objectives. It is why educational and vocational training programmes have always been widely available and why very high standards have been set.<br><br>
Sentence planning is now available in Maghaberry, Magilligan and the young offenders centre, which enables prisoners to plan their time in prison to make the very best use of the training and therapeutic opportunities available. An increasing emphasis is placed on prisoner programmes aimed at addressing offending behaviour.<br><br>
I understand, Mr. Jones, that under the rules of the House, the debate should finish at 1.29 pm. I have tried to set out some of the wider issues, although I have touched on specific points raised by the hon. Member for East Londonderry in relation to incidents at the Maze after the escape of Liam Averill and the murder of Billy Wright. Inquiries are under way and I give a commitment to the Committee and to the House that those matters will be taken very seriously indeed. But such in-depth inquiries can be held only if people cooperate with them. What comes out of the inquiries may address some of the genuine concerns raised by the hon. Member for East Londonderry and by the hon. Member for Lagan Valley, who raised those matters in an Adjournment debate last week.<br><br>
I realise that you are about to call me to order, Mr. Jones, but I hope that I have been able to deal with some of the points raised by hon. Members. As the hon. Member for East Londonderry said, we will return to
