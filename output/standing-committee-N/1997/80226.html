	<br><blockquote><p>That, at this day's sitting of the Committee, Standing Order No. 115(2) shall have effect with the substitution for the words "two and a half" of the word "three".—[	<i>Mr. Murphy.</i>]</p></blockquote></p>
	<p>	<i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: We now move to the main business of the Committee, which, following the Committee's agreement to the extension, can continue until 1.30 pm.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Paul Murphy)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you Mr. Atkinson. After that exciting introduction, I beg to move.
	<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the draft Appropriation (Northern Ireland) Order 1998.</p></blockquote>
Details of the sums sought in relation to the draft order are given in the estimates booklets and the statement of sums required on account, which have been placed in the Library of the House and are available from the Vote Office.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is significant that this is the first meeting of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee at which a Northern Ireland appropriation order will be debated. I look forward to hearing what hon. Members have to say in relation to the draft order. I shall please them by saying that I intend to make my initial remarks as brief as possible. I was reading last night that Mr. Gladstone made Budget speeches that lasted for at least four or five hours. That is certainly not my intention this morning.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The draft order has two purposes. The first is to authorise expenditure of £148 million in the spring supplementary estimates for 1997–98—the current financial year. That will bring the total estimates provision for Northern Ireland departmental services to just under £7,000 million for this financial year. The second purpose of the order is to authorise the vote on account of just over £3,000 million for the next financial year, 1998–99. That will enable the services of Northern Ireland Departments to continue until the main estimates for next year are introduced later this year. I remind the Committee that the draft order does not cover expenditure by the Northern Ireland Office on law and order and other services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>2</span>
Some of the votes seek token increases only, because new pressures on spending have been offset by savings elsewhere in the vote. I shall refer only to the main areas in which supplementary provision is sought, so that hon. Members have the maximum time for debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A net increase of more than £17 million is sought for agriculture. That includes £5.4 million to control outbreaks of animals diseases, such as salmonella, Newcastle disease and, of course, BSE. Within that vote, £5 million has also been made available to bring forward, to the 1997–98 financial year, the payment of about 1,250 capital grants claims, relating to the sub-programme for agriculture and rural development. Those payments would otherwise have been held over for payment in the next financial year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Token increases of £1,000 for the Department of Economic Development are sought in votes 2 and 3. In vote 2, an addition of about £500,000 is for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, to assist the development of tourism in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Tourism plays an important role in economic development in Northern Ireland, where it is estimated that spending by holiday visitors and domestic holiday makers accounts for approximately 2 per cent. of Northern Ireland's gross domestic product, and sustains approximately 12,500 jobs. This and other increases are off set by reduced requirements and increased receipts elsewhere in the vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A token increase of £1,000 is also sought by the Training and Employment Agency. An increase of £3.6 million is sought for the jobskills programme to meet increased demand, and for the training centre network for payment of training allowances. Also in vote 3 an additional £1.5 million is sought for the Government's new welfare-to-work initiative. That is a major plank of Government policy, which will fund preliminary work, including demonstration models, before the Province-wide introduction of the new deal in April. At present, approximately 3,000 18 to 24-year-olds participate in agency employment and training programmes. From 6 April, the agency will provide for approximately 10,000 young people, on a new deal option financed through either the new deal allocation of £140 million or transfers from existing provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
All members of the Committee believe that unemployment is a huge waste of our talents and economic potential and a major cause of poverty. A Government priority is tackling, the root causes of unemployment and providing new opportunities for work. Welfare to work is a major and innovative initiative, which is targeted directly at tackling unemployment. It is aimed at getting the young and long-term unemployed into jobs, and helping them to stay in employment. That will be achieved through increasing their long-term employability by improving their self-respect, skills, experience and motivation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Main increases in the Department of the Environment include £4.1 million for roads and maintenance, £1.6 million for the operation of ferry services, £2 million for compensation payments to Northern Ireland Railways and nearly £2 million to meet the cost of concessionary bus and rail fares for the elderly, disabled people and children of school age.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0602">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>3</span>
In a previous sitting of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee, we discussed next year's estimates. Unfortunately, we had to deal with a reduction in the estimates for housing in Northern Ireland. I am glad to say that in the supplementary estimates, we have found a net increase of £17.2 million for the rest of the current financial year. Some £7.5 million is for assistance to the voluntary housing movement, and includes a transfer of funds from the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to housing associations to enable an additional 400 new dwellings to be started in 1997–98.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is important to recognise that the housing success story continues. Preliminary results of the 1996 house conditions survey show a significant reduction in unfitness levels. An additional £10 million, including £3.7 million from the capital receipts initiative, is being provided to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In vote 4, which covers environmental and other services, a net increase of some £6.2 million is sought. Some £7 million is for regeneration-related matters and £8.4 million represents carrying forward running cost and capital underspends from previous years.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, South)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the extra money include provision for the frail elderly at Carlisle Circus to allow developments to continue at Clifton house?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am sure that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will have the answer to the hon. Gentleman's question in his winding-up speech. I hope that it will please the hon. Gentleman.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Other increases within this vote include £2.4 million for planning compensation and £3 million to meet a variety of increased costs in the environment and heritage service, construction service and other agencies.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Members of the Committee are deeply conscious of the importance of the education system in Northern Ireland. A net increase of £29 million is sought. That includes £12.5 million for grants to education and library boards—mainly for schools maintenance, home-to-school transport, energy efficiency measures, special educational needs, library stock, the harmonisation of pay and conditions of manual and white collar staff and redundancy costs. In addition £800,000 is for research in universities, while £16 million is for student loans due to a reduction in expected receipts from the national sale of the student loans debt book.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Can the Minister tell us whether the additional moneys, which are welcome, that he has outlined for education expenditure include provision for Northern Ireland students who are pursuing four-year courses at Scottish universities? There should be parity for our students.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Murphy</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State has been dealing with that issue over the past few weeks, and I am sure that he will answer the hon. Gentleman's question later.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>4</span>
An increase of £2.8 million under the Government's new deal initiative is also sought for schools and institutions of further education.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Turning to the Department of Health and Social Services, a net increase of some £48 million is required in vote 1. That is for expenditure on hospital, community health and personal social services, health and social services trusts, family health services and certain other services.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On vote 4, a net increase of £11 million is required. In addition to capital and administration pressures within the Department, that includes some £700,000 in respect of administering the welfare-to-work initiatives.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Vote 6 covers social security centrally administered by the Department of Health and Social Services. A net increase of some £2.4 million is sought. That is required to reimburse the social fund for expenditure on cold weather payments in 1996–97, winter-fuel payments to pensioners in 1997–98 and increased payments into the Northern Ireland national insurance fund in respect of statutory sick and statutory maternity payments. Those increased requirements are offset by savings elsewhere in the vote.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Hon. Members will want to debate the real Northern Ireland. Schools, hospitals, jobs and training matter deeply to the people of Northern Ireland, and I look forward to debating those important matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are debating £150 million bering rightly spent on additional services, yet over the past few days, as members of the Committee will remember all too vividly, there have been bombings and the public purse will, rightly, have to pay millions of pounds in compensation. It is worth considering that that money could have been spent on hospitals, schools, roads and jobs. That thought must be at the back of all our minds.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Grand Committee's work will continue but in time, the administration of the services to which I have referred may be the work of an assembly for Northern Ireland. I commend the order to the Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>10.44 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall concentrate on transportation in Northern Ireland. However, I should like to raise a couple of points before I move to my main comments.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
First, there is the social security agency. I have been informed that the Post Office is withdrawing from its counters the social security literature that was freely available to help people find out about benefits and how to claim them. I spoke to the agency and to Post Office Counters, and I understand that a debate is taking place between them. A letter from Post Office Counters states:
	<br><blockquote><p>"Similar DSS leaflets provided by the Benefits Agency at post offices in England, Scotland and Wales are unaffected."</p></blockquote>
Why are the leaflets being withdrawn from Northern Ireland post offices, and what will the Minister do about that?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
New legislation on road tax has been introduced, and I know that many people support that idea, because much road tax has not been paid in some areas of Northern Ireland. There should be clampdown on that—people's
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0603">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>5</span>
cars are sometimes clamped for it. Many people are now rushing to pay their road tax. A matter that has been raised with me is that people want to return to the old system under which road tax could be renewed at post offices. I understand that that is still the case int he rest of the United Kingdom, but it no longer happens in Northern Ireland. Why not? Will the Minister consider restoring that facility, at least to main post offices in Northern Ireland towns?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received many communications about vintage motor cycles and cars from clubs and individuals. The correspondence is about those who have such vintage vehicles but have no number for them. In the rest of the United Kingdom it is possible to get in touch with Swansea and be provided with a number that is suitable for the vehicle, but that practice apparently ceased in Northern Ireland about three years ago and people have been unable to get anything done about it. Why has that happened? I have received an explanation from Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland. However, perhaps the Minister could approach the matter along the lines of having some of the suitable numbers—perhaps 1,000 of them—transferred to Northern Ireland so that anyone who wanted one could have one.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have the honour to be a member of the Select Committee on Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs—of which some hon. Members on the Labour Benches this morning are also members—and we are at present considering transport in general in Great Britain. In that process we have gone into every aspect of the matter. In thinking about transport one must examine not just roads, air and sea, but overall planning. Even housing estates come into the equation. That is a good approach and I should like the Minister to consider it. He may say that it has been dealt with already, but I fail to see it in Northern Ireland. The entire context of transportation should be taken into account on a Province-wide scale.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The evidence to the Committee has been fascinating; even the strategic rail authority should take account of other aspects, but sadly, the exciting idea that transportation in Great Britain should be considered in the round could not be applied to Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that there is great demand for new private houses to be built in Antrim and the Carrickfergus borough area, but that such opportunities are hampered by inadequate service roads? It should have been recognised long ago that the A8 Larne to Belfast road, which is part of the trans-European network, is an arterial road serving the nation as a whole in the island of Ireland. That primary route should have had priority and been developed a long time ago.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my hon. Friend and his remarks prove my point. Every aspect of planning, including housing, shows the importance of the A8 road to Larne. What chance does Northern Ireland have of an integrated transport system? We want improved public transport, a reduction in pollution and congestion, less freight traffic and cars kept out of towns, but any discussion on transport in Northern Ireland makes little reference to rail. The prospect for Northern Ireland of having piggy backing or links to Great Britain or Europe
	<span class='label label-info column'>6</span>
by train is not possible. It is ironic that when we had a proper rail system in Northern Ireland there was no commuter problem, but today, when we have no extensive railway system, we have a massive commuter problem. We hear a great deal about persuading people to stop using their cars so as to reduce congestion and pollution and help the environment. We support that, but not all car owners may do so. It is a sound idea, but if drivers leave their cars, how will they commute if there is no adequate public transport to get them into the towns? I remind the Minister, and the Committee, that buses are like large cars. They may carry more people, but they have many of the disadvantages of cars.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There was a letter from a gentleman on that very subject in one of the local newspapers yesterday. He said that he left his car at home and went into town by public transport. While he was waiting near the City Hall for the bus to return home he was alarmed to note—I quote from his letter—that
	<br><blockquote><p>"the pollution emitted from those city buses is a real health hazard. Every breath you take is an inhalation of poisonous fumes—the effects of which penetrate into the lungs."</p></blockquote>
He ends by saying:
	<br><blockquote><p>"In future I will avoid public transport and use my own car."</p></blockquote>
The Minister may say that the Government have been in power in Northern Ireland for only a short time. But I am talking about plans to examine the thing in the round. Will the Minister tell the Committee why rail has been ignored in Northern Ireland? Even simple link-ups such as Bleach Green and Whiteabbey have been sidelined, although they would not be complicated to set up.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am astonished that proposals such as the BCDR Company's plan to use Ballynahinch as a freight depot, and re-lay the old track bed between Ballynahinch and Queen's Quay, which goes within a few hundred years of the sea, have not been taken up. Flat-bed freight wagons could go from there directly to a ship, and so to the rest of the United Kingdom—and the rest of the world.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that rail enthusiasts have tried for six years or more to attract finance for feasibility studies but have been continually discouraged, especially by the Department. That seems odd, as if the study were positive, the company would implement its own plans with private finance and no Exchequer money would be required.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is there such indifference to the railways in Northern Ireland? Let us remember the great advantages of implementing those ideas. Heavy vehicles would be removed from the roads, the potential for accidents would be reduced, there would be a direct link for freight between Northern Ireland and Europe and the rest of the UK, which would be provided by a fully commercially viable, privately owned transport system that did not need Government subsidy. Bearing in mind the fact that the Government's connections with Translink mean that they virtually own it, I have to ask the Minister whether it is Government policy to ignore anything that might possibly be competition for bus transport? It certainly seems so.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Northern Ireland is well served by air links. Travellers probably become irritated when they travel to City airport during the rush hour, just as many people are irritated by the traffic lights at Templepatrick when rushing to get flights. I am sure that London airport would love to have nothing but such minor problems; its own are much greater.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0604">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>7</span>
City and International airports are privately owned. Can the Minister explain the Government's role in relation to airports and the overall air travel picture? Would he be able to influence an airline, or an airport, if Northern Ireland, as a region of the UK, had problems with air travel?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
At yesterday's meeting of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and the Regions, I asked Civil Aviation Authority representatives what the CAA would do if an airline which operated a viable link between a region and Heathrow decided to withdraw it. They said that they would not be able to do anything about it. I then asked what they would do if an airline serving a region of the United Kingdom withdrew its routes between that region and London. They replied that they would not do anything about it as they did not have the authority and it was not their job. That is on the public record. The inference I drew was that it was a matter for the Deputy Prime Minister. What authority does the Northern Ireland Office have over airlines?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that with the prospect of a regional air network for Wales too, and the potential development of direct links between Wales and Northern Ireland, his question has particular poignancy?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, indeed it does. It would certainly apply to all regions. Inverness would be one example. The matter should be looked at.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I was at the Select Committee meeting yesterday that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We took evidence from the Civil Aviation Authority and there was a great deal of discussion of the point he raises. We were also told that some of the changes in the Civil Aviation Act 1982 have now been superseded by what is happening in Europe. European directives can cause problems for regional airports. It is not just the Government who are responsible; EC regulations also have an influence.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Yes, I thank my hon. Friend—if he does not mind me calling him that—for those pertinent remarks. We look forward to hearing the Minister's response. My next question concerns air traffic control. Do the two main airports in Northern Ireland, the International and the City, have a primary or a secondary air traffic control system? Perhaps the Minister will also tell us about his responsibilities towards them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The road system in Northern Ireland is under continual discussion by all hon. Members from Northern Ireland. We all have our little list of roads in our constituencies. Most members of the Committee would concede that key routes should be agreed. Key routes are vital for commerce and tourism, as the Minister has already mentioned, and for free movement for everyone. The lack of a railway system means that goods vehicles play an essential role, bringing in supplies and taking out both manufactured goods and foodstuffs from the farms. Our farming industry is important.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>8</span>
Despite the private finance initiative, public finance is still essential for key routes. If public finance is not available, then we might be able to bear private finance and perhaps, in certain circumstances, toll roads. However, I ask the Minister to consider the following situation. A toll road might be built in one area of Northern Ireland, and in another area with similar problems a road might be built using public finance. What would happen in that situation? It would be chalk and cheese. Decisions about such roads would need careful consideration. The case for a toll road would have to be strong, if public money were used to build other similar roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Strangford)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree entirely with my hon. Friend's remarks about key routes. The Government's priorities on such routes are wrong. The most important key route is the gateway to Great Britain; that is the road from Belfast to Larne. That should be our number one route, carrying twice as much traffic as the road to Dublin. It is certainly the gateway to the rest of the United Kingdom for Northern Ireland industry. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government are wrong to pour money into the Dublin road, ignoring the improvement of the road to Larne?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I agree with my right hon. Friend, and no doubt we shall hear the Minister's views on that matter at the end of the debate. Our ports play an important role in exports and imports. The are a lifeline to the outside world, and road connections should take that into account. My right hon. Friend made that point clearly.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I am opposed to any proposed change in the trust status of the Belfast port. When the Government were in opposition, that matter was debated in another context and the Labour Opposition were against the removal of trust status. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether that view has changed since his party came into government? The trust has been of great service not only to Belfast, but to the whole of Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist party does not want to see any changes in the trust.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I, too, support the retention of trust status for Belfast port. Its removal might be attractive to those insiders and special interest groups who would benefit—such as the airport employees who, in a similar situation, became multi-millionaires overnight. It would be of no benefit to the nation, only to individuals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does my hon. Friend agree that the operation of the privileged trust status of Belfast port should be monitored? That would ensure that no special inducements were offered to operators of freight and passenger services, which would be detrimental to other ports and create unfair advantage and competition. All ports should be able to attract the same level of grants from all sources. When grants are being awarded, there should be no differentiation between privately operated, managed and owned ports and those with trust status.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I would not disagree with that. It always puzzles me why a line travelling the shortest route between Northern Ireland and Scotland came into Belfast. The logic of that escaped me. I agree with my hon. Friend that such matters must be monitored at all times.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0605">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>9</span>
I have one concern about ferry companies. A ferry broke down this year somewhere else in the United Kingdom and another ferry was removed from one of the Belfast routes to replace it. That is a great disadvantage for freight carriers in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is unfortunate that the rail line between Stranraer and Carlisle—I hope that you will forgive me for straying slightly, Mr. Atkinson—has gone. If it were still there, it would be ideal for Northern Ireland containers on freights to be loaded on to flat-bed wagons and carried down to the south of England and even Europe. As I said, it is unfortunate that we no longer have that line. I asked a representative whether there was any chance of its being restored and the gentleman did not say that restoration would be impossible, so we live in hope.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The high accident rate is also worrying. We welcome measures to discourage speeding and drink driving. We also welcome the clampdown on road tax dodgers. However, it is chastening to have received a letter from the Child Accident Prevention Trust stating that every year 40 children die in Northern Ireland as a result of accidents. Approximately 4,000 children are admitted to hospital and 100,000 are treated in accident and emergency departments. I commend the child safety week that the trust is organising between 22 and 28 June. We must reduce accidents and take care of our children.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Accidents occur as a result of other factors too—roads needing repair, defective and inadequate street lighting and so forth. The Minister will know all about that, but I hope that he will explain why nothing has been done. We all pay lip service to stopping accidents and taking good care of people, but we are not doing enough about it. It may be easy for Opposition Members to pontificate, but I have to point out that we do not have any power. The Minster has the power in his hands.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Fortunately, arbitrary decisions on road gritting have not been a problem this winter. Listening to weather forecasts recently, I have been hoping that it does not become a problem. All maintenance schemes require finance, of course. This is another argument for Province-wide planning, to avoid competition between areas over quite different requirements. It would be best to deal with the matter in the round, strategically.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A great bone of contention is the matter of unadopted roads in Northern Ireland. Many are roads that were supposed to be completed, but still have not been, in places where people bought their homes. Unfortunately the Department responsible does not seem to want to take action on the matter. I understand that it was investigating the problem, and I should like to know the outcome.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My general argument about planning will, I hope, be supported by the two examples that I shall give. The first concerns a fairly wide road in my constituency, which runs to a T-junction. Traffic lights were installed at the bottom because it led to a main road. That was satisfactory. People could reach the main road with a little time and patience, and everything worked beautifully. Unfortunately the planning service gave permission for hundreds of houses to be built at the top of the road, resulting in massive congestion at the bottom. A little planning would have helped. The matter should have been
	<span class='label label-info column'>10</span>
considered as a whole, instead of by letting the road service do one thing, the planners another and the water service something else.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My second example concerns a dump or quarry. I shall not mention its name. Permission was given for the quarry to be filled with rubbish and a second extension is now being considered. In response to a parliamentary question about the road traffic figures for the roads around that former quarry, I learned that none were available. I am greatly puzzled as to how a decision will be taken, if those responsible do not know how the roads will be affected. The local newspaper is now up in arms because of the rubbish and congestion and the danger on the roads.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is most important for the Government to consider how many unlawful landfill sites have developed throughout the country since the landfill tax was imposed? Perhaps they should amend the legislation to allow for retrospective demands to be made for tax on large-scale landfill that has gone ahead without planning permission or approval.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend makes a good point. In my constituency, business people in some areas are having their rubbish collected not by the council but by private firms. When I asked the local council why that was happening, I was asked by the officer in charge to inquire where the private firms were dumping the rubbish.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I end by repeating my view that transportation in Northern Ireland must be considered in the round. We must look not only at roads, but at planning, the environment and the rest. I wait with interest to hear what the Minister will say.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. I must tell the Committee, before I call the next speaker, that although the debate will continue until 1.30 pm, if Members make lengthy speeches, not every Member will be able to speak.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>11.21 am</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Antrim)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I do not share the Minister's view that it is a good thing to take the appropriation order in Committee. The place for this important debate is on the Floor of the House, where it can be given adequate time, as it has in the past, and, as the late Enoch Powell said, people can wander from Dan to Beersheba on matters that affect their constituencies. Issues affecting the people in Northern Ireland need the greater coverage of a debate on the Floor of the House and people want to hear the Minister's answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak first about the Department of Economic Development. The Government have a two-faced approach to our economy. They want to hype up any good news as if it is entirely their own making, and blame any problem on the "troubles" or the effects of political instability. The Tories were the same—we criticised them just as much as we criticise the present Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are hypocritical in their approach to the economy. The Minister told us that the economy is "the best kept secret", yet he threatens the Ulster people that if they do not reach an accommodation with IRA/Sinn Fein at the talks the economy will be doomed. The
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0606">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>11</span>
so-called business leaders have also fallen for that message; they are so hypnotised by the prospect of Government grants, or position, that the so-called great and good will not face the reality that the Northern Ireland economy has survived and grown and will continue to thrive in spite of those who want to bring the Province to its knees.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Appeasement of terrorism simply does not work. We have had a taste, in the past few days, of the cost of such appeasement. The people of Moira and the people of Portadown are sweeping up, as they have had to do before, especially in Portradown, and counting the cost of appeasement but they are going on with the job that has to be done.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was somewhat bemused by those who claimed that their constituencies had been bombed because they were at the talks. That is utter nonsense. The Member who says that would talk himself out of a job. He could say to people, "Vote for me, you will be bombed." If the IRA terrorist wants to deal with a Member, he will attack him personally by sending him a letter bomb. He will not blow up a police station. The reason why these attacks are being made is because Mr. Flanagan had the guts to say that the Provisional IRA was responsible for two killings. These bombings will continue and police stations will be attacked.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Appeasement fails in political terms and it is catastrophic in economic terms. Republican terrorists want to hold the entire community to ransom. I understand, as the Minister said, that money must be found to get people back into business. But the republicans think that if they keep at it in some way, they will gain. Some idiotic business leaders have also fallen for the appeasement policy but, thank God, not all of them. The men who have borne the burden in the heat of the day have been bombed time and again, but they are not talking of appeasement.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last Friday, however, the Chamber of Commerce hosted a special lunch for the leader of IRA/Sinn Fein. While guests consumed oysters and champagne, he was given an opportunity to spell out his economic blueprint, to the clapping of those present. They clapped the republican who was responsible for the Bloody Friday massacre, and the devastation and savagery of the La Mon bombing. Both tragic terrorist attacks, not only had his approval but were of his invention. He was in charge of the IRA in Belfast at that time.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
A recent biography of IRA/Sinn Fein leader Adams exposes him as the man who developed the tactic of bombing economic targets to squeeze political concessions. A marked feature of his leadership of the IRA in Belfast between 1972–74 was the increase in explosions at economic targets. Amid the clinking of glasses and polite conversation, the leader of IRA/Sinn Fein, who destroyed so much opportunity for economic growth and prosperity, was entertained and "engaged"—I think that that is the correct term. A few hours later, the people of Moira were sweeping up their businesses in a bomb-devastated village. What hypocrisy! What craven lunacy! It would be a comedy if events were not so devastating.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>12</span>
The Government bury their head in the sand. They refuse to believe that the bombs are IRA bombs. They claim that the IRA has made a statement, which we must believe. But how can we believe what the IRA says? We have caught out the IRA in its lies time and again. The IRA claims that it gives warnings, so that everyone can get away, but the police tell me that it provides no warnings. The IRA has not gone away. Sinn Fein leader Mr. Adams said that at the City hall. Yet the Government refuse to face the consequences of that for our economy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The genuine business leaders of Northern Ireland, men and women who have toiled against the odds and made Northern Ireland a success, despite Government failings, will pick up the pieces. They will continue to prosper because they are the backbone of the economy. They should not be held to ransom by a Government with a failed talks process. Whatever the outcome of the current pathetic talks, the Government should not try to threaten Ulster people into accepting proposals that are against their political interests by putting them under duress and telling them that the economy will be undermined if they reject those proposals.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In an announcement by people who talk about having an agenda, it was said that a liberal supply of money from Europe had been secured. I am a Member of the European Parliament and I shall find out how that money was obtained. What is the purpose of the agenda? Is it to tell people how to vote in a referendum about which they know nothing? Political leaders told us that they would persuade the silent majority of Northern Ireland people to speak at last. If some hon. Members studied the percentage of people who vote in Northern Ireland, they would realise that the people of Northern Ireland consist not of silent majorities, but of voting majorities, who express their views. But we will leave the agenda until another day.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Speaking on 27 January 1998 the Minister with responsibility for the economy outlined what he called the "economic realities". He said that the
	<br><blockquote><p>"Northern Ireland economy has not just been holding its own but has gone from strength to strength in a wide range of sectors. It has rightly been described as Europe's best kept secret."</p></blockquote>
If that is so the Government must stop the pretence of threatening that all will be doomed if agreement at the talks is not achieved by May. The Government walked into a Sinn Fein/IRA trap when they accepted false deadlines. They should de-couple themselves from the process and move not only to economic realities but to political realities.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I welcome the significant new investment coming to Northern Ireland. Those people came not to appease terrorism but because it made economic sense. Business men do not come because they believe in charity but because they think that they can make money. The Northern Ireland work force is one of the most highly skilled in Europe. It is highly educated. We boast some of the best social conditions and working environments as well as some of the most competitive labour costs in the whole of western Europe. We are on the doorstep of Europe and are the entrance to that market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Instead of boasting that that is the best kept secret in Europe, the Minister should be out there letting the secret out of the bag and telling people what a wonderful place
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0607">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>13</span>
Northern Ireland is. I do not want Northern Ireland's plus points to be kept secret; I want them to be told abroad. The Government insist on treating Northern Ireland as a place apart in this United Kingdom. The one thing the Government can do politically in Northern Ireland is to prove that we are not a place apart but are part of the United Kingdom. We should be given a say over our destiny, like Scotland and Wales. Consult the people.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government are right to encourage investment into Northern Ireland but they must also remember the local companies. The Minister will be aware, although it is not his bailiwick, that one in three employees in manufacturing work in businesses that employ fewer than 50 people. Those businesses are hampered by bureaucracy and red tape. More must be done to free the local investor from such constraints. Local business people with a stake in the community, who have suffered in the community yet continued, must be helped by the Government.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I recently received a letter from a Belfast company that manufactures shirts. Other hon. Members received a similar letter. The company has developed a key high-quality product at a time of instability. Like every other decent citizen, its staff long for peace. We all long for peace. The people I represent—the majority population, as it is called—have suffered more than any other part of the community. They know what this war is about and how they have suffered. Those people have fallen into the trap of pleading with politicians to take part in talks with those who bomb and kill and maim.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I wrote to the partners of the company and congratulated them on their product, but informed them that politicians who promise they can deliver peace by talking to terrorists are telling untruths. The fact is that they are responsible for creating an uncertainty. They are enlarging the expectations of the terrorists and playing on the genuine desires of decent, law-abiding citizens. We must move away from such a false political process.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Local businesses must be encouraged. I was recently made aware of a proposal to develop a tourist shopping outlet in Banbridge. It is an excellent proposal, which the Government should get behind. They should help the Gilford Mill company to cut red tape so that it can continue with a most enterprising scheme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The area around our airport is another prime location for manufacturing and other types of development. The airport's owners have great plans for the area. Ministers should meet them and help them realise the employment potential there.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Much has been promised on the tourist front. The Minister has said that if there is a peace deal 20,000 jobs will be created. What worries me is what they will say about tourist projects if we do not get a peace deal. The north Antrim coast, which I represent, is a tourist's dream area. Yet there are no signs anywhere on the way up from Belfast that there is a new ferry service from Ballycastle to Campbeltown which opens up the whole of Ireland to the Highlands. Its fare is the cheapest; two people with a car pay £99 for a three-day return ticket. For the benefit of any Members representing Scottish constituencies may I say that the service is not subsidised by any of the Government money that subsidises the highlands and islands. I do not blame the Scots for wanting to be
	<span class='label label-info column'>14</span>
subsidised because they need a subsidy for the highlands and islands. But there is not one sign in Belfast or up through Antrim informing the people about a ferry service.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I met the company's management and asked what the trouble was. I was told that the Department of the Environment does not like signs. I have heard of otherinstances from people who have come to see me. A major businessman for Ballymena had an upmarket car business, but the DoE would not allow him to put up a sign. After two years he did so, and was told that he would be taken to court. He came to me as his Member of Parliament; I told him to put in an application and say that we would fight the case, which we did. The Department's planning section fought like a tiger to prevent the sign from being put up on the road but the planning adjudicator, who had some sense, eventually gave my constituent permission to exhibit the sign for his business, which was bringing employment to the area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There are some great hotels in north Antrim, but any attempt to expand them is met with a policy of threat and a spend freeze by the Northern Ireland tourist board. The Causeway Coast hotel at Portstewart had to sell out to a major developer because the tourist board would not help its owner to expand its accommodation, conferencing promotion and leisure facilities. I wish the new owner well. He has plenty of money behind him but I am sorry that the man who built the original building, paying for it with his own means, will not reap the benefits that have come to that area.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for agriculture, I am sure that the Minister is now aware of the amazing statement from Europe about its decision on a two—tier European Union as regards beef. There is to be no—risk beef, and risk beef. The United Kingdom will have to label its meat as risk beef. I know a little about Europe and I can say that Europe, in its madness in trying to keep British and Ulster beef out of the market, has destroyed its people's appetite for beef.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Of any kind.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is correct. Now we find that as many as 30 or 40 per cent. of the population in some countries are not eating any meat. Why are they scared that eating Ulster meat, which is the best—better, even, than English, Scottish or Welsh, although it has taken me some time to convince people of that—is a risk? In a European committee I asked the top man whether every country in Europe had a law stating that BSE was a notifiable disease. He said not at all, that some countries in Europe did not even use the name BSE: they called it by another name and did not even notify their Governments. Those are supposed to be the countries with no-risk beef. They are simply trying to save their old market.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Standing Veterinary Committee of the EC is meeting next week. I am glad that my colleagues and I have been able to write to every Head of Government to put the case again for Ulster beef. As the Minister knows, the heart of our economy is agriculture. If we go down in agriculture we go down all round. It will also affect the rest of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0608">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>15</span>
We are told that Europe is all one, that the borders are down and that there is perfect freedom, yet Europe now distinguishes between risk beef and no—risk beef, which is scandalous. It also means that this country cannot protect its citizens against European beef that is not good for our people. We will find that we cannot close our borders against meat that is a risk to our people, but the so—called no—risk beef producers will not have to put signs on their meat. Those matters cause great concern. Many colleagues want to take part in the debate and the Chairman has wisely suggested that we should be brief. For a preacher, my contribution has indeed been brief.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be even briefer than the two previous speakers. I want to focus on two areas of the Government's programme—health and education. I have some questions to put to the Minister and 1 hope that I shall receive some proper answers.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Health has received extra funding over the past nine months or so. However, some of the increased revenue spending has come from capital. What have been the movements in the capital accounts for the current financial year, and how much will be shifted over in the next two years? If there has been a substantial shift of moneys allocated for capital spend, which capital projects have fallen behind? Have any projects been abandoned? I recall during my time in the Northern Ireland Office that we held the budget close to our chest in a many ways—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (Mr. Tony Worthington)</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What a whopper!</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed we did. Now the Minister has put his hand into the till and has used the money for revenue spending. We simply want to know how much he has taken and what he has spent it on. There is nothing unreasonable in that. It is a perfectly reasonable question.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister update the Committee on various projects? The PFI project at the Downe hospital is close to the heart of the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) and I know that he recently asked the Prime Minister a question about its redevelopment. Will the Minister also tell us about the new Causeway hospital at Coleraine? There are rumours that it is not proceeding as quickly as planned. Is it one of the capital projects that is being slowed down? Finally, will the Minister tell the Committee about the progress of the Ulster hospital refurbishment? Has it begun yet, and if not, when will it begin?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the time scale for the amalgamation of maternity services from the Jubilee hospital at the City to the Royal Maternity site? What is the estimated cost of refurbishing the Royal Maternity hospital to accommodate the department from the Jubilee hospital? Where will that money come from? It was not in the budget when I left the Department of Health and Social Services. Will the Treasury be asked to allocate additional money from the
	<span class='label label-info column'>16</span>
Northern Ireland block, or will other planned capital expenditure schemes—from the health budget or other budgets—be displaced?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the position regarding acute hospital re-organisation? Are consultations currently taking place about the future of any hospital in Northern Ireland? In that context, I refer to three hospitals: the South Tyrone; the Mid Ulster and Whiteabbey.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Does the Department of Health and Social Services have an efficiency target? When the Conservatives were in government we introduced such targets, varying from 1.5 to 3 per cent. If the Government have set an efficiency target, will the Minister tell the Committee what it is? If there is such a target, does the amount include the savings that the Minister expects to gain from dismantling the so-called market in health, or will that efficiency saving be over and above the anticipated bureaucratic and administrative savings?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: What does the hon. Gentleman mean by a "so-called market"? When he was in office he told us that he was setting up a market.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It went under the name of a market. However, during my time as a Minister there was not a market in the obvious sense. It was called a market but it was not one. There were no free transactions between bodies. The purchasing plans between GPs and local hospitals were maintained even though there was a so-called internal market. I repeat my question to the Minister. Are the efficiency savings additional to those that he plans to achieve from administration and bureaucracy?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
What is the future of education and library boards? Will the Minister look again at the reasons why Northern Ireland needs five education and library boards? What will he do about overspending by boards? Why should boards that keep within their budgets be penalised because others cannot do so? No doubt the money to bail out overspending boards has to come from elsewhere in the education budget, and that penalises other sectors of the education system in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Why is the present system of direct funding for voluntary grammar schools to be switched to one that would route the money through the library boards? During Northern Ireland questions, the Minister said that he wanted to equalise the funding formulae for all schools. That is sensible, but it does not mean that the money has to go through the board. The money could be calculated according to a fair and reasonable formula, but still be paid directly to the schools. If it were paid to the boards, in the same way as money is paid to local education authorities in England and Wales, some of it would not be passed on to the schools. At least, under the present arrangements, every pound of that funding goes from the Department to the schools concerned. There will be no benefit in routing it through the boards. There could be a common funding formula, but the system for payment could be retained.

My final questions relate to the Department of the Environment. In his opening remarks the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office referred to an extra—I
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0609">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>17</span>
think that he used that word—£4.1 million for road maintenance. Is that extra amount additional to the money that was set aside in the budget for road maintenance, or is it a draw down at the end of the year of the £4.1 million already allocated?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There have been cuts in the Department of Environment, notably on housing and on roads. They are among the more serious effects of the Government's operation of bloc spending in Northern Ireland. Will the Minister tell the Committee whether there are plans for new road building in Northern Ireland in any of the next three years? I do not believe that there are, but I would like confirmation on that point. There have been many questions about roads this morning—the A8 was mentioned several times. However, it is unlikely that building will start on any of the new roads that were in the programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister give us an update about the West link? That was to be a private finance initiative scheme. We investigated it when we were in government and it would have taken up most of the road-building budget—possibly the entire road-building budget—over the next few years. Other schemes were deferred, such as the bypasses for Limavady, Comber and Toomebridge, the further dualling of the A26 and the dualling of the A8. Those schemes could now be undertaken if the West link does not go ahead.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Will the Minister tell the Committee whether the Bleach Green rail link is still in the programme and when it is likely to begin? It was in the frame last year, but there were some delays because of overspending within—I think—the Northern Ireland Transport Holding Company.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Cecil Walker 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, North)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Northern Ireland has suffered much throughout 30 years of civil unrest. There have been over 3,000 deaths and almost 40,000 people have been injured—some of them, seriously. Our troubles have taken many forms, ranging from individual murders to a systematic attempt to destroy our whole infrastructure. The construction industry has suffered most from the efforts of those who seek to undermine the fabric of our society.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The industry covers a wide spectrum of activity and its importance to the economy cannot be overestimated. Construction is one of the largest employment sectors, employing more than 35,000 people, directly or indirectly. It accounts for 6 per cent. of our GDP. Many thousands of jobs in ancillary industries rely wholly on the construction industry. Unfortunately, since 1990 the number of employees in the industry has fallen by 20 per cent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There has always been a heavy dependence on Government spending for construction work in the Province, because of the lack of state-owned companies. Under part I of the schedule, the order addresses some of the issues relating to monetary provision. However, more can and should be done to support an industry that is ready and willing to play a full part in the restoration and development of the Province, to enable it to compete within the competitive bear pit of the European Community. I recognise that there are public finance
	<span class='label label-info column'>18</span>
difficulties at present, and that construction programmes must be within certain parameters. However, the value of public expenditure on new construction starts in 1997–98 has been cut by 30 per cent. The construction industry in Great Britain is enjoying a boom but in Northern Ireland the industry is still dependent on the public sector for work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) said that we all want a peaceful society. Improvements in economic prosperity, employment and social conditions will help that process. But a healthy construction industry can contribute to achieving those aims by maintaining jobs and reducing the burden on the social security budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
My hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim (Mr. Forsythe) referred to his anxiety about an overall transport strategy for Northern Ireland. My main concern is that the Government appear to have abandoned their major road programme for the Province. Faster economic growth for Northern Ireland means exporting to Great Britain, Europe and beyond. To keep transport cross-competitive, it is essential that an improved strategic road network is constructed and maintained. A modest £10 million per annum over a five-year period could complete an upgrade or a strategic network. As most of the roads are Euroroutes, I presume that they would qualify for European funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the subject of housing needs and land shortages, the number of households in Northern Ireland is set to rise sharply in the next 20 years. An aging population and demographic changes will mean more people living alone. The Under-Secretary of State said that thousands of new houses will be needed to cater for the next generation, but there is a severe shortage of land for housing development and without this ingredient, housebuilding will fall by 60 per cent. in the next five years. It is essential that immediate action is taken to release housing development land over and above the designated brown-field sites. The housebuilding industry is vital for the local economy as it helps to sustain employment in many other sectors. Housebuilding needs materials such as bricks, tiles and cement; white goods, carpets, curtains, furniture, lighting and garden landscaping are needed when the houses are built.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
This year, the Housing Executive rents paid by my constituents and those of my hon. Friends will rise by 4.8 per cent., a full 2 per cent. above inflation. In my constituency there are many elderly Housing Executive tenants. Many of them have modest occupational pensions which put them just above the threshold for receiving housing benefit. They are not wealthy people and many will be forced to use the small savings that they have put aside during their working lives to pay another stinging rent increase. Those people, who are already living on the margins, are being used to offset Government shortfalls in funding the Northern Ireland housing budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Under-Secretary sought to justify the increase above inflation by quoting the lower rent levels in Northern Ireland, but he failed to acknowledge that residents of Northern Ireland have a much higher cost of living than people elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The 2 per cent. increase above inflation will cause great hardship for constituents who are caught in the trap of
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0610">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>19</span>
having a low income which is nevertheless above the housing benefit threshold. Those people will have to struggle to keep paying their rents. I ask the Under-Secretary for a commitment that this year will be the last in which my constituents will, through a rent increase, have to bridge the gap in funding for housing. Will this also be the last year in which Housing Executive rents will be increased by more than inflation?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Reducing VAT on repairs and maintenance could benefit the building industry. It has been reported that the Exchequer may reduce it from 17.5 per cent. to 5 per cent., provided European Union Finance Ministers agree. That would greatly benefit registered builders in Northern Ireland in their constant fight to compete against disreputable cowboys who flood the industry and live as parasites on the people whom we represent.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I appeal to the Government with respect to VAT, to consider old churches that require restoration and renovation. Such work can be intricate, and costly and reduction or removal of VAT would greatly help the church bodies that find essential maintenance financially difficult.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Planning Service, which is included in part I of the schedule, has an important part to play in the economic regeneration of the Province. The service seems to be severely under-resourced. It clearly does not have sufficient funding or staff to enable it to fulfil its obligations, which include the reviewing of area plans. The delays have a knock-on effect on the overall building programme. It is important that sufficient resources to enable the service to fulfil its statutory functions should be made available. I appeal to the Under-Secretary of State to deal with that and the other matters that I have raised.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Peter Robinson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Belfast, East)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I have not intended to make a speech, but merely hoped to intervene. However, as some time is available, I am happy to follow the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Walker).
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government have published a document entitled "Shaping Our Future". In it the Planning Service takes a regional approach, and makes it fairly clear that there will be a requirement for about 200,000 houses in the next 20 to 25 years. I do not know whether the Government are aware that almost all the ground in the south and east of Belfast that was zoned under the Belfast urban area plan has been built on. The only mechanism established in that plan was for a review—which I think had to take place in 1993, but in any case has not happened. The result was that builders began to make applications relating to ground in the white land that was to be built on.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Planning Service made a bit of a mess of the process, with the result that, instead of a structured review of the Belfast urban area plan, we have had several article 31 inquiries under the Planning Order. These have considered several developments, but it is a piecemeal way of reviewing the plan, and to date the inquiries have not produced any result. The effect of that will be considerable unemployment in the construction industry as more and more builders run out of ground and no more is released to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>20</span>
The other impact of what I have outlined will be soaring house prices. The small amounts of land that become available are going for prices that are astronomical for Northern Ireland. In some cases, the price of ground has risen—to £500,000 an acre. That increases the price of housing considerably. The price of new-build houses is so high that builders do not find it advantageous to build houses because secondhand dwellings are so much cheaper. That will affect the housing construction programme and cause greater difficulties in future.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Government document "Shaping Our Future" suggests that the 200,000 houses will be constructed over 20 or 25 years. That is a major house building programme, which will affect the next generation of people in Northern Ireland. There is a statutory process for the Belfast urban area plan, and other urban area plans whereby the Planning Appeals Commission is required to take evidence. First, written evidence is provided. The commission then holds hearings during which objectors can give evidence. Cross-examination can also occur. However, the Government do not intend to set up such a process for the house building programme that is described in "Shaping Our Future". The issues will be tackled simply by examination in public.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Northern Ireland Planning Office drew the case of a five-year housing programme to my attention. Examination in public took place in an English county. The chairman said that he wanted to ask a few questions to clarify matters in his mind, and the examination was over in a few hours. Should such a process deal with the construction of 200,000 houses in Northern Ireland over the next 20 to 25 years?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The process should be detailed, to give objectors, and communities where the programme will effect major changes, an opportunity to express their views. Developers should also have an opportunity to say whether the Government have got the balance right in their housing programme.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
"Shaping Our Future" clearly suggests that the Planning Service has consigned some councils to low levels, and others to high levels of growth. Greater Belfast contains a third of the population of Northern Ireland, but will receive less than a fifth of the new house build under the proposals. The Government have decided that they will direct people to various parts of the Province. What standing will "Shaping Our Future" have in planning? Will the Planning Service use the document for appeals, and refuse planning applications that run contrary to the outcome that "Shaping Our Future" sets out? Will the document have statutory effect or will it be considered as a planning guideline? What flexibility will planning appeals commissioners have in dealing with applications that run contrary to the document's aims?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to speak about preparatory school education. I am watching out for the Under-Secretary's cringing. He hoped that the issue had gone away, but it returns, at least for this morning. The Minister made an announcement, which resolved the matter to some extent for the current year. He reduced Government aid to preparatory departments from 40 to 30 per cent. Preparatory departments will have to live with those new terms.
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0611">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>21</span>
However, campaigners fear that the Government may remove another chunk next year, and perhaps a further chunk in the following year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I know that the Government do not review that expenditure annually—their programmes run for three or for five years. Will the Minister assist preparatory departments by lifting the axe for at least the duration of the designated period? If funding is not changed from that allocated for this year, forward planning would be possible, the blight in preparatory education would be lifted, and the minds of parents would be put at ease. I trust that the Minister will give me some good news on that front.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Secretary of State came up with the bright idea of having pop concerts at Stormont. She seems to feel that the house of government in Northern Ireland should be demeaned by punk rockers and the like strutting round Stormont Buildings. The bands will make much noise and their followers will cause all sorts of problems for local residents. Some weeks ago, I spoke to the Secretary of State about that, but the proposal still seems to be on course. However, I believe that it will be started by not a punk rocker but Pavarotti, who is hardly a punk rocker—and Garth Brooks has been mentioned. That is only the beginning—who knows what will follow? Perhaps Oasis will come: the Prime Minister might want to bring his friend, Liam Gallagher, to Northern Ireland—he would make a good companion for the hon. Member for Belfast, West (Mr. Adams), both of whom are the Prime Minister's house guests.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I have received several hundred responses from local people—either in writing or by telephone—and I must inform the Secretary of State of their views, although I shall not offend her by reporting some of the remarks that were made about her. The scheme had, in effect, two proposals: about what to do in the Parliament Buildings, and about what to do in the grounds of the Parliament Buildings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There seems to be general agreement that it would be appropriate for educational tours to take place in the Parliament Buildings and for professional bodies and other organisations to use them for dinners and meetings. Residents have little difficulty with those proposals, provided that the events maintain some dignity and remember Stormont's standing in the minds of many people in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Residents are prepared to accept that there should be a children's play area in the grounds of the Parliament Buildings and that there should be trim trails. The grounds are a nice setting for recreational pursuits, and many people take walks there. However, the suggestion that we should have pop and rock concerts in the grounds makes local residents' hair stand on end. I received 208 responses, and only three people did not categorically say, "This should never happen." Of those three, one said, "Yes, it should happen," and the other two said, "Well, why don't we try it once or give it a six-month trial period and see how it goes?" However, 205 of the 208 people said, "Absolutely not. This is a dreadful scheme that we should not even contemplate." They are the people who will suffer. They will suffer from the many problems associated with pop concerts, including the crowds, the loss of amenities and the noise, and people will use local
	<span class='label label-info column'>22</span>
residents' gardens for toilets or drop litter in them. I trust that the Secretary of State will listen to the people. The right hon. Lady talks a great deal about consent, and here is an opportunity for her to take the issue of consent to the people.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Would the Secretary of State also be well advised to learn from the experience of the U2 concert in Botanic park last year? The row continues between the council and the organisers over the repairs for damage done on that occasion.

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Robinson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I am glad that hon. Gentleman intervened. I was about to say that the Botanic might be a good place for concerts instead of Parliament Buildings. I shall now not make that suggestion.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
As for Shorts, my hon. Friend and I met trade union representatives there. I also had a meeting with the management about the dispute. It is essential that the matter is resolved quickly. I said to management and the men that, as a Member, I do not intervene in industrial disputes because it is not appropriate. Both in circumstances where a significant number of jobs will be lost, or where contractual arrangements appear to be or are broken, it is proper for a Member to seek clarification from the Government. I would accept a written response on that.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Conservative Government attached certain conditions to the privatisation of Shorts. A sizeable public asset was handed over to Bombardier. There is no doubt that Bombardier did very well out of the deal. I suspect that conditions were laid down by the Government on jobs being kept in Belfast. I would be keen to discover whether undertakings were signed or agreed at the time on research and design facilities at Shorts in Northern Ireland. It appears to the men that the removal of those facilities to Canada is a breach of earlier undertakings. Transparency is important to ensure that public money was not given and that undertakings were not breached.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Finally, I want to thank and congratulate the Minister responsible for the Department of Environment in Northern Ireland for his decision to allow free fares for senior citizens. That was one of my party's manifesto commitments. We were keen for people in Northern Ireland to have the advantage enjoyed in parts of Britain where senior citizens have a form of contact that their finances would not otherwise allow them to have. Many people are imprisoned in their homes. They cannot see their relatives and friends, and many of their friendships and connections are cut off because they do not have the transport mobility enjoyed by others. It is a small matter for some of us, but it is a major concern for senior citizens in Northern Ireland, no less than in any other part of the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was delighted that the Minister responsible for the Department of the Environment agreed to establish a pilot scheme involving my council and, it is to be hoped, another council to work with Translink on free fares. The council, needless to say, was willing to pay the additional money, but the legal issues were such that we were going
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0612">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>23</span>
to have to wait to see wether anyone would take legal action against us to determine wether we were acting ultra vires.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister has removed that danger by acting under section 81 of the Local Government (Northern Ireland) Act 1972 and is allowing the pilot scheme to take place. He has provided some of us with some hope that the Labour Government have not forgotten their grass roots support and their social reforming tradition. I trust that the pilot scheme will be successful and that it will be extended throughout Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Thompson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak about some issues that are important to my constituents and to Northern Ireland in general. I was not happy to hear the implied threat that if bombs go off in Belfast and terrorism increases, there may be a reduction in expenditure by the Northern Ireland office to pay for such atrocities. The previous Government and the present one have expertly turned the (blame for the security situation) from themselves to the population of Northern Ireland. The prime responsibility of any Government is to ensure the peace of the people they govern. Successive Governments have failed to maintain peace in Northern Ireland, so they should pay the bill and not take it out on the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland who have no legal input or ability to change the security situation.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I turn to agriculture, on which Northern Ireland has a problem. As everyone knows, Northern Ireland had a very high percentage of beef exports and its economy and agriculture are greatly endangered by the continuing ban on those exports. When we entered the Common Market we expected it to be a market of Europe, but when the ban was introduced Europe told us that we could not export our beef, even if it is to countries outside the EC. If that were not so, at least some beef could be exported from Northern Ireland, but the argument seems to be that that beef might be used in products that are imported back to Europe. Surely it is possible to get round the problem.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
On the radio this morning, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food seemed to concede that farmers on the mainland will not now have to pay the cost of setting up the traceability system in Britain, nor the cost of the beef on the bone ban and of removing the spinal columns from sheep. If that is the case, perhaps the Minister will consider whether any comparable savings could be applied to help agriculture in Northern Ireland through its difficulties.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Minister with responsibility for education will know of my concern about the incorporation of colleges of further education, which will result in additional expenditure. The Minister informed me by letter that £92.4 million will be spent on those colleges this year, which represents an increase of nearly 4.5 per cent. on the previous year. In view of increased teaching costs, higher inflation, additional maintenance costs and insurance, that 4.5 per cent. increase is inadequate. Less money will be available to carry out the teaching responsibilities of colleges of further education in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>24</span>
There is a large differential between costs per student in Northern Ireland further education colleges and those on the mainland. Putting Northern Ireland colleges on a par with those on the mainland would require considerable additional expenditure. I endorse what has been said about education budgets and schools. Money currently goes to boards which allocate it to schools. Schools purchase educational goods and send the invoices to the boards for payment. The boards then send them back to the schools to confirm that they have been paid. It seems unnecessarily bureaucratic and that system should be done away with.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
When a budget is set for a school, there is no reason why resources cannot be allocated to it to be spent prudently on educational goods. Schools should be able to pay for goods directly. Presently, it is almost impossible for a school to know exactly where it stands financially. The Minister should take that into account.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Unfortunately, my constituency has the highest unemployment in the United Kingdom. Of the 25.9 per cent. of 15 to 24-year-olds who are unemployed, 13.3 per cent. have been unemployed for more than six months. Of the 74.1 per cent. of those aged 25 and over who are unemployed, 37.7 per cent. have been unemployed for more than six months. I therefore welcome the introduction of the new welfare-to-work initiative. Unemployment is a difficult problem, especially in some parts of Northern Ireland. Some people have become so accustomed to being permanently unemployed that it has almost become a way of life. The problem is especially difficult for the over-25s. The problem starts at an early age, so the youth part of the scheme for the 18–25 age group is most welcome. If we can start to solve the problem for that age group we may in time solve it for the over 25s.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I understand that £3 billion has already been allocated to the programme and that about £140 million has been allocated to Northern Ireland. If we compare that on a proportional basis, which seems sensible and accurate, with the figure for the young unemployed within the whole of the United Kingdom, it should be £186 million. Perhaps the Minister will look at that and ensure that the money is proportional because there is a great need in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I thought that the school leaving age in Northern Ireland was 16. Some pupils who leave at 16 go straight on to the unemployment register. If they have to wait until they are 16 to 18 before they can join the scheme, there may be a problem. I welcome the opportunity to speak about these moneys. I apologise to the Minister that I cannot be here for his entire response, but I shall read 	<i>Hansard</i> with interest.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate. First, as the local Member of Parliament and as a resident, I condemn the IRA bombers who visited such devastation upon the village of Moira at the weekend. That is the IRA's economic policy. It will cost about £3.5 million to rebuild the damaged properties, and that money could have been spent on building new schools and hospitals and on providing employment in Northern Ireland. It highlights the hypocrisy of people such as Gerry Adams who talk about their economic strategy while their henchmen in the IRA carry on these violent campaigns.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The people of Moira will pick themselves up. Like the rest of the people of Northern Ireland in the face of such terrorism, they will keep going, but the bomb will leave a deep scar upon their memory. They will not forget the terror visited upon them, but they are determined to ensure that the IRA terrorists do not have their way in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The courage of its officers, who cleared the scene with only minutes' warning, undoubtedly saved lives in Moira last weekend, as it did in Portadown a couple of days later. Many of those who have attacked the RUC want it to be disbanded, but it has been in the forefront of defending innocent people against the terrorists, as it did again last weekend. When the RUC station was destroyed, its officers went on with the business of saving life despite seven of them being injured in the explosion. The gratitude of the people of Moira goes out to those brave RUC men who acted so swiftly and courageously.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We welcome the current review of the various economic development agencies. I pay tribute to the Industrial Development Board, the Local Enterprise Development Unit and other agencies that have worked hard in difficult circumstances to promote economic development in Northern Ireland. I am sure that they would acknowledge that there is always room for improvement. We hope that the review will lead to greater efficiency and maximise co-ordination between the economic development agencies in the Province. My party wishes to contribute to the review, but it is crucial to the building of the economy in Northern Ireland that the Government give those agencies proper financial support as they seek to attract new investment.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I pay tribute to those in local government for promoting economic development, and in particular to the many local enterprise organisations that have worked extremely hard on the ground to assist local business to develop and expand. I think particularly of Lisburn Enterprise in my constituency which has been most innovative in developing local business and enterprise in the area.
	<span class='label label-info column'>26</span>
I commend the work of enterprise agencies and hope that those that have been successful will continue to receive Government support.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is a problem for economic development and the attracting of inward investment in terms of the Planning Service approach. Companies wishing to invest in Northern Ireland face considerable delay in obtaining planning permission. The waiting time for planning permission for industrial development is substantially greater than in the rest of the United Kingdom. There can be no excuse for that. If we are to be competitive with other regions of the UK—which are on the verge of having their own forms of devolved government—as well as with other parts of Europe, we shall have to do more to get the planning system right, so that firms that wish to invest in Northern Ireland do not have to wait two and a half years to get planning permission to proceed with their projects. I cite the example of Stannifer, which has waited that length of time for a planning decision for an investment worth millions of pounds at Sprucefield, in my constituency. The firm is still no closer to being given an answer. I will not go into the merits of the application, but I think that it is entitled to an answer after a two-and-a-half year wait, having spent £350,000 of its own money developing the application.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

Planners should develop an overall strategy for the development at Sprucefield. The Planning Service undertook that there would not be subdivision of retail units there, but that is now happening. That means that smaller units are in direct competition with retailers in Lisburn town centre, and what was supposed to be a regional retail development is becoming an alternative town centre. That is a matter of great concern, which highlights the need for a strategy.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim about the need to examine the roads infrastructure. That is important for our economic development. The Al is one of the major routes in Northern Ireland. A recent Automobile Association report cited that dual carriageway as one of the most dangerous roads in the United Kingdom. The Hillsborough junction at Dromore has been the scene of many fatalities in recent years. The problem should be remedied, and I hope that a higher priority will be given to it—but I understand that it is not in the five-year plan of the Department of the Environment Roads Service. Given the route's importance, I hope that Ministers will reconsider giving higher priority to upgrading it and making it safer for its users.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I support the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, North about housing. The Lisburn area plan, which affects a large part of my constituency, was recently published. Lisburn is the second largest local government district in Northern Ireland, yet the areas that are zoned for housing under the area plan are inadequate for Lisburn's development needs in the next five to 10 years. I hope that in the forthcoming public inquiry, planners will be persuaded to designate more land for housing development, and that the Government will invest more money in housing in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The Housing Executive has done a good job in redeveloping housing in many parts of Northern Ireland. But I note with sadness the reduction in its budget. Housing should be given greater priority. If that is not to be done through the public sector, areas should be designated for private sector development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I want to consider health, and especially the debate about the future of hospitals in Northern Ireland. I support Downe hospital's case. It is not in my constituency, but it is part of the Down Lisburn trust, and is linked with the Lagan Valley hospital in Lisburn. I regret that promises that were made to the people of Down have not been fulfilled. The hospital in Down may now become a community hospital, not the local acute hospital that was promised, and that the people of Down want. The debate about the future of Downe hospital is also about the future of local acute hospital provision in Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I do not oppose developing centres of excellence in large acute hospitals, but removing acute hospital services from local communities does not improve the quality of care. It increases waiting lists and reduces access to acute
	<span class='label label-info column'>28</span>
care. We must strike a proper balance between developing centres of excellence and providing acute services in local communities, where local people have access to them.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The health service should be as close to people as possible. I challenge the notion that local hospitals provide a lower standard of care. That is not true of Lagan Valley hospital, which provides a high standard of care for my constituents. I hope that that will continue and that the Government will provide the local acute hospital that the people of Down were promised and that they deserve. I look forward to the Minister's response.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.49 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall be characteristically brief. I want to consider four items. First I want to speak about roads and transport, a subject that my hon. Friend the Member for South Antrim covered comprehensively. He referred to the vital need for key routes to be identified and to meet the proper standard for European trunk routes. Village and town bypasses are important elements of key routes, because the main bottlenecks occur there. Until that problem is tackled, we shall have constant traffic flow problems throughout Northern Ireland. The Minister knows about the problems, and I hope that he will accept the essential need for town and village bypasses. We depend on road transport far more than does anywhere else in the United Kingdom. Lack of proper infrastructure will greatly diminish our capacity to attract inward investment and industry, especially in the western parts of the Province.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The second issue that I want to raise is the ambulance service in Northern Ireland. We are very grateful for the extra moneys that have been made available to upgrade the service. They were much overdue, but they will go some way towards redeeming the defects that the Government inherited. We greatly welcome the moneys. Will the Minister give us an undertaking that they will be part of a rolling programme, so that the age and mileage of ambulances are kept within the normal standard requirements laid down for such vehicles throughout the kingdom?
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We cannot simply buy ambulances and forget about crews and the depot facilities that they need. An ambulance depot is essential at the new Causeway hospital, but I understand that no provision has been made to build one. The ambulance service in Coleraine is in very restricted, substandard accommodation at the old hospital and the matter must be addressed with great urgency, as building work at the new hospital is already going ahead. It is not sensible for the ambulance service to remain the Cinderella service; it is an essential part of hospital and health-care provision.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The third issue is housing. The Minister is aware of the horrendous waiting lists that exist in some parts of Northern Ireland for Housing Executive grants. The quality of the house is no longer the determining factor in deciding whether a means-tested grant is payable to the occupant or the landlord of the dwelling. That was a tremendous shift in policy and led to an enormous increase in individual grants for improvements. Grants paid to landlords changed enormously too and are now related to the rentable value of the dwelling before and after repairs are carried out.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0615">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>29</span>
It was a mistake to move the means test from the house to the individual. The Government must carefully consider the change in determining eligibility for grants for housing improvements in Northern Ireland and the merits and demerits that flow from it. It is a big problem which has caused enormous difficulties for all sorts of people. Unless the matter is resolved, there will always be a backlog of repairs in some parts of Northern Ireland.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The fourth issue arose when I was travelling to the House of Commons. It is a matter for the Treasury rather than for Northern Ireland Ministers, but the hon. Gentleman may wish to consider it. Many hon. Members who travel regularly from Northern Ireland use different airlines for the outward and return parts of our journey. Hitherto, the airlines were prepared to accept the return journey on the same basis as they accepted the outgoing journey. I recently presented my ticket from Belfast and the girl at the ticket desk said, "You do realise, Mr. Ross, that because this is for the return journey, you are liable to pay airline tax on it." I said, "How come?" and she replied, "It depends where your journey starts." There is something wrong if one has a return ticket but the return leg, in some circumstances, it treated as the start of a journey. Will the Minister bring this little quibble about the way that the law is drafted to the attention of his right hon. Friend the Chancellor so that the matter can be resolved? It is easy enough for us to get another ticket and revamp our journeys at a later date to avoid that payment, but it does seem ridiculous. I hope that the Minister will bring the matter to the attention of his right hon. Friend to see what can be done to redeem this silly bureaucracy.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.56 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Harry Barnes 	<div class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Derbyshire)</div> <!-- memberconstituency --></div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I want to raise a point about European regional policy and the labour market in so far as it affects appropriation in Northern Ireland. The objective 1 moneys that Northern Ireland receives are under review. Regional and labour market policy is to be reformed with a new scheme that will operate from the Year 2000 to 2006.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The European Commission outlined its proposals last year and details are due to be published in mid-March, together with information about changes of regulations within the EU. Negotiations will then start in earnest so it would be helpful to know about the Northern Ireland Office's perspective—and how it fits in with the Government's view more generally—on those matters.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
There is to be no cut in overall funding for European regions. However, some changes will seriously affect Northern Ireland. It is proposed to reserve 66 per cent. of available funds for the worst-off regions—known as objective 1—with a gross domestic product per head of less than 75 per cent. of the Community average. That applies now, but there will be a significant change.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In the past, member states in the Council of Ministers used their political discretion to fix the list of regions that would be eligible under objective 1. The cut-off point was 75 per cent. with a margin of flexibility of up to 80 per cent. That marginal flexibility made Northern Ireland and certain other areas of the United Kingdom eligible for objective 1 funding.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>30</span>
The Commission is now proposing that the Council of Ministers should have no margin of flexibility in deciding the list. That could be a real problem for Northern Ireland. The Government say that it does not affect their overall figures because of the principle of additionality. Nevertheless, moneys that have been available in Northern Ireland may no longer be available, which could impact on appropriation. That is a serious matter. I, and doubtless other members of the Committee, want to know what the Northern Ireland Office—and the Government generally—are going to do about the problem to ensure that the present flexibility continues to exist in future for the benefit of Northern Ireland and other regions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>12.59 pm</p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Time flies. I reckon that 68 points have been raised by members of the Committee. In the time available I doubt whether I shall be able to deal with them all. Many hon. Members asked for assurance that we would write to them. I am happy to give that assurance. Many of the points were worth while and I shall want to respond to them in writing.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
From the start, our thoughts go out to the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) and his constituents in Moira and to others in Portadown because of the way in which they have been abused by irresponsible wicked people who have disrupted their lives. That is quite unacceptable and we wish them well in rebuilding their lives. We want to provide a secure context for economic growth and development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss) made a startling statement about health policy during the past few years. I thought, when he referred to the "so-called" internal market, that he had made a slip of the tongue, but he really was saying that the previous Government's entire health policy was based on a fiction. He was recognising that there was no market and that patients could not simply go to any hospital so that market forces could work.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It would be fine if that fiction had had no cost, but it has had an enormous cost. The Northern Ireland health service was structured for the market. We entered the last election on a pledge, which we shall honour, to remove that market. The amount of resources that have gone on bureaucratic structures for the "so-called" market has been tremendously damaging. Northern Ireland has been left with a health and Social Services department, a health and Social Services executive, four boards, 20 trusts and several commissioning agencies for 1.6 million people. That was done with the goal of creating a market that a former health Minister now admits was a fiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not say that it was a fiction. If it does not exist, why are the Government so intent on taking it away? We still need accurate administrative controls, reporting and costings. How else can we run a health service?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The former Minister, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire, said it was a "so-called" market. Doctor was set against doctor, health board against health board, hospital against hospital in a spirit of competition. The hon. Gentleman is now saying
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0616">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>31</span>
that what he constructed was a fiction and was not worth while. We have said all along that we need to construct a seamless health service, based on co-operation, in which all members of the service can work together. The hon. Gentleman worked against that by creating a market that could not and would not work in Northern Ireland.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Thompson</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: When will the Government change the situation in Northern Ireland? One of my constituents is required to pay £70 to get a scan because she is going to a hospital that has some arrangement for her area.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Within the next month, we will produce a consultation paper on the future structure of the health service in Northern Ireland. We will attempt to have a primary care-led service dedicated to the proposition that quality of service should be the same wherever one lives in Northern Ireland. it will never be possible for the health service to provide everything that everyone wants; the resources will never exist. However, the situation in which treatment depends on whether one's doctor is a fundholder or when the quality of service depends on residence must be overcome. The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire has now admitted that the "so-called" market was a fiction.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>

The hon. Member for Belfast, South (Rev. Martin Smyth) spoke about Clifton house and the replacement of an old building with a new one at Carlisle Circus. An application for an urban development grant is being considered by the Department of the Environment, which, I believe, is in touch with Clifton house.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for South Antrim asked about social security literature. When I read about the matter in the newspapers I was as surprised as he was—we do not want such problems to continue. Social security information must be available in post offices, and we are having discussions with the Post Office to ensure that the problem is corrected. I do not know how it arose, but I have sought to ensure that the information will continue to be available—in fact, we should enhance its availability.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall ensure that the hon. Member for south Antrim receives correspondence about road tax and vintage cars. He also asked about the railway services and integration. I am sure that he knows that the White Paper on integrated transport policy is due to be published later this year, and that Northern Ireland officials and Ministers have been involved in the consultation process. We shall publish a complementary Northern Ireland transport policy document at the same time. We are committed to that policy in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, and Northern Ireland Members will be able to discuss the details later this year.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman—and, I believe, the hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss)—discussed the neglect of the railways and the reinstatement of the Antrim-Bleach Green line. Northern Ireland Railways
	<span class='label label-info column'>32</span>
says that the work to reinstate that line will commence in the middle of 1998. The line will provide a more direct rail link to Belfast—the journey time from Londonderry to Belfast will be reduced by up to 37 minutes. I hope that the hon. Gentleman is pleased by that information. Although he was commenting on the situation over the past 18 or 19 years, I must deny the fact that we neglect the railways. We are investing substantially to upgrade lines—I have just given one such example—and to purchase new rolling stock. The possibility of a public-private partnership on further purchases of rolling stock is being investigated.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Air traffic control is not the responsibility of Northern Ireland Ministers, but I shall ensure that the hon. Gentleman's remarks are conveyed to the appropriate authorities. He also asked about toll roads. The only toll road that is currently under consideration is the Toome bypass. We have recently completed consultations to test local reactions. Whether the scheme goes ahead depends on private developers' interest.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
We are conscious of the importance of high accident rates, which the hon. Gentleman discussed. It was important that the previous Government introduced—belatedly—the points system, by which drivers who are caught out are eventually disqualified. We hope that that will have a downward push on the figures. I believe that the hon. Gentleman was present when we approved the order that imposed greater sanctions on young and inexperienced drivers. That order should also help.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman referred to the Child Accident Prevention Trust—for a while I thought that was a family planning group, and I know that other hon. Members were under the same misapprehension—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: A misconception.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: —although I realise that the hon. Member for North Antrim was not.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
In promoting health and preventing illness, especially among young children, it is important to recognise that those are not matters for one Department. We must create safe environments for children. I chair a ministerial group on the prevention of illness and the promotion of health in Northern Ireland. the first issue that we shall consider is the safety of young children. Accidents are a major hazard for young children, so we shall consider road safety. We are specifically considering ways of making the early years safer.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I shall write to the hon. Member for South Antrim about the adoption of roads, but I have some difficulty in responding to the hon. Gentleman on the issue of the quarry that cannot be named. I may know of the quarry that dare not speak its name, but it will be difficult for me to be specific in my answer.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Forsythe</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I did not want to go into detail because I was speaking generally about transport.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Indeed. I shall ask the Department to respond, both specifically and generally, on that matter.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Antrim criticised today's procedure. However, the debate has been well attended by Northern Ireland Members and has lasted for the usual
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0617">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>33</span>
time—three hours. I would have thought that a debate at this time would attract more attention than one late at night, when our debates have tended to take place. Many Members welcome the fact that we have had this debate at a civilised hour.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Antrim referred to the growth of the Northern Ireland economy despite the disturbances. It is bad news if we do not have a steady, peaceful framework. The lack of a long-term political settlement can only be bad news for the economy of Northern Ireland. We need a stable framework, so that when my hon. Friend the Minister of State with responsibility for economic matters goes to Japan or Taiwan, he can sell the virtues of Northern Ireland rather than defend the consequences of disturbance on economic development.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I agree with a good many of the hon. Member for North Antrim's comments. He said that Northern Ireland was an excellent place to invest, and mentioned the qualities of the education system. However, we must not be complacent. A significant number of youngsters reach higher education, and that is to be praised, but we cannot be satisfied with the skill level of many school leavers. Above all, we cannot be satisfied with the skill base of the Northern Ireland population, which is lower than elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
It is not just a case of upgrading skills held by school leavers who join the economy, but of increasing the activity of adults within and outside firms. That is why our welfare-to-work programme is so important. By improving the quality of adult activity and ensuring that it is based on skills, we will increase the investment in people, which is essential. Skill shortages, which are reported throughout Northern Ireland, need to be tackled. Although I agree with the hon. Member for North Antrim that we must sell the positive, we must also ensure that the positive grows. We should not say that the skill base is adequate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Yesterday's Green Paper on lifelong learning—"The Learning Age"—is important for Northern Ireland, in particular for the introduction of individual learning accounts, the creation of a university of industry and the pledge to use all available technology. We hope to improve the skill base in small and medium-sized enterprises in Northern Ireland as much as the skill base might be improved in a large firm which invests in training. The hon. Member for North Antrim will recognise that it is a big challenge to improve the skill base and to increase investment in training people in small and medium-sized enterprises.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North Antrim referred to the review of the support structure of the Department of Economic Development. That is important. I think the hon. Member for Lagan Valley welcomed the review because it will determine whether the framework is right and whether we are investing in the right targets for improving the economy. I shall convey to my hon. Friends his comments on the Ballycastle to Campbeltown service. My knowledge of that is limited, but people have told me that it is a success and carries more people than was expected. If it was not marketed as well as it should have been, we should be told.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<span class='label label-info column'>34</span>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Beggs</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman also raised the difficulties experienced by hoteliers in obtaining signposts. That is common in many parts of Northern Ireland. It is not relevant to the Ballycastle—Campeltown ferry alone, and it would help if the Minister were to convey that.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall do so. The matter was mentioned several times in the debate.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire referred to the "so-called market". I have dealt with that. Whoppers come in twos. His second was the reference to how the previous Government safeguarded the capital budget. I must tell the hon. Gentleman that the sum for the final year of the capital budget for education was cut from around £56 million to £23 million. The Lord save me from those who are protecting me.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: On a point of order, Mr. Atkinson. I did not mention the capital budget of the Department of Education, I specifically referred to the capital budget of the Department of Health. Will the Minister answer the questions that I specifically asked about that Department?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>The Chairman</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Order. That is not a point of order, it is a matter of debate.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Thank you, Mr. Atkinson, for that constitutional guidance. With respect, the hon. Gentleman made a general point about comprehensive spending reviews—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was not.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It was. It was noted. The point was about comprehensive spending reviews and the fact that within them there was a separate capital account. I am not sure that it is right to refer to a separate capital account—it is included with everything else, and money can be switched from revenues to capital.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: No, I will not. The private finance initiative, which the hon. Gentleman referred to, I think, within the context of education—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That was not so.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I will discuss PFIs in a general context. Over the past 10 months we have sought, with great energy, to explore the potential of the PFL It is still largely unknown whether it can deliver as much as we hope in some major areas. Within the context of education, however, we are close to being able to confirm a major project involving the North-West Down Institute. Over the next few months, there will be other PFIs to consider in the education budget.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Gentleman said that he had heard rumours of problems at the Causeway hospital in terms of the speed of making progress. That surprised me, because my
<span class="label imageref" title="SC1997-1998V006P0I0618">JPEG</span><!-- image -->
	<span class='label label-info column'>35</span>
information is that progress is being made according to schedule. The hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross), however, may have other information.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: You are the Minister.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I just wanted a second opinion, as the hon. Gentleman asserted that there were problems at the Causeway hospital. I have not heard of any problems—the chairman of the trust told me that things were progressing well—and I think that that position has been confirmed by the hon. Member for East Londonderry.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for East Londonderry also raised the issue of the ambulance service. I will inquire into it, and report my findings back to him in detail.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I can confirm that when we visited the new laundry in Ballymoney, which is part of the Causeway hospital project, we were told that progress was up to date. The only matters I would draw to the Minister's attention are that the entrance and some road works are causing some problems.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It has therefore been triply confirmed that the project is proceeding on schedule.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. William Ross</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: It will be apparent to the Committee from some of the exchanges that have just taken place that although the Minister intends to send individual letters to hon. Members giving information about the issues that they raised, such a device is of no use when every hon. Member on the Committee is interested in the Minister's reply. Instead of sending an individual letter to each hon. Member on the Committee, detailing only those items which that hon. Member raised, will the Minister consider sending out a general letter covering all the issues? I asked for this two Parliaments ago, and nothing happened. If we were not meeting in this Committee, but on the Floor of the House, every Member of Parliament would have a chance to ask questions. If we were considering a Bill or the Budget—as we will in a week or two—every hon. Member would have an opportunity to probe. That is not possible in this Committee, so every hon. Member with an interest in these matters should be sent a general letter giving them the answers to all the questions that were asked in Committee.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: That is an interesting point. I do not want to give an immediate response, because it would have implications for many other Committees. I remind hon. Members that all written responses to hon. Members' questions are deposited in the Library and are therefore accessible.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for North-East Cambridgeshire also raised the issue of structural change and efficiency savings. We inherited a situation in which 3 per cent. efficiency savings had been imposed on the national health service and on personal social services in Northern Ireland. That was merely another phrase for cuts. boards and trusts asserted that they had made efficiency savings, but their deficits were sky-high. How can one make an
	<span class='label label-info column'>36</span>
efficiency saving while having an increased deficit? We propose structural change; the consultation document proposes a more lean, efficient management structure for the national health service in Northern Ireland that will yield proper, rather than spurious, efficiency savings.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
I was also asked about education and library boards and boards that were in deficit—</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Moss</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I asked specifically about Downe and Ulster hospitals. He has not answered my questions.</div> <!-- membercontribution --></p>
	<p>	<div class='member'>Mr. Worthington</div> <!-- member -->	<div class='membercontribution'>: I shall try to come to those points later. I have answered a higher percentage of the hon. Gentleman's questions than of anyone else's. I do not want to be unfair to others.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
Last week I received a message from the education and library boards, saying how they are working co-operatively together and doing together that which it is appropriate for them to do. I remind the hon. Gentleman of the strife in the system a year ago. The education and library boards are now working with the Department in a much more helpful and constructive way—as they, not I, have said.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The deficits occurred last year. The south-eastern and western boards, which were in deficit, have been allowed to rectify their situation within a framework that allows them to repay over several years, and that is fair to the entire system. We are conscious that it would no be fair to other boards if they were to have to contribute to what would be seen as a deficit created by one particular board.
<br><br><!-- lb -->
The hon. Member for Belfast, North raised many important issues about the construction industry. I share his sense of importance. I recently visited the training board, to see what it was doing. I was delighted to be told that it was the first visit by a Minister for over 20 years. That demonstrates the priority that we have given to construction.

I cannot promise that there will be no rent increases above inflation in future; I cannot promise anything for next year or for the future. We shall consider the hon. Gentleman's point. It is fair to say that the Housing Executive recognised that it was necessary to attempt to earmark some resources for capital out of this year's rent increase. Rents are considerably lower than elsewhere.

We have written to everyone who wrote to us about prep-school education. Again, we cannot guarantee that there will be no change in the future. We have said that we shall wait and see. The hon. Member for North Antrim asserted that our proposals would be counter-productive. If he is right, that will inform our future decisions. However, as we said in the letter to parents, we have done what seems prudent. We shall wait to see whether it was prudent and then take decisions. I believe that many parents were reassured by the letter.
