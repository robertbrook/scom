The Northern Ireland Economy</div> <!-- legislation -->
<p>10.30 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before I call the Minister to move the motion, I remind members of the Committee that our debate can continue until 1 pm. I have no power to impose a time limit on speeches, but it will assist me in my efforts to call as many hon. Members as possible if contributions are kept reasonably brief.</span></p>
<p>10.31 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>The Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr. Adam Ingram)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I beg to move,
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the Northern Ireland economy.</p></blockquote>
I shall try to be brief, but that may be slightly difficult I have many of pages of notes on many matters that members of the Committee will wish to discuss.<br><br>
I am pleased to open our debate. It is important to have a substantial discussion on the Northern Ireland economy, which is vital to the future of the Province. In many ways, and in spite of the difficulties, the Northern Ireland economy is a success story. Since the early 1990s, Northern Ireland has out-performed the economy of Great Britain, primarily because of external factors rather than self-generated indigenous growth. The growth that has occurred in recent years can be built on with fairly focused strategies and the right framework. In that context, I shall set out the Government's aims and our views of the way ahead.<br><br>
To give a topical example, the Government's commitment to the Northern Ireland economy is illustrated by the personal interest that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has taken. He has been examining ways to underpin the political talks. Obviously, I do not want to discuss the Belfast talks, but hon. Members will recognise that they are at their most crucial phase. I was therefore pleased to announce a few weeks ago that my right hon. Friend is exploring options with political parties and putting together a package of measures to boost the local economy, help the drive towards a settlement, and put something in place post-settlement.<br><br>
The Chancellor's initiative, as it has become known, is a great opportunity for local political parties to help to shape the package's contents. I have already set the ball rolling. I have completed a round of meetings with all the local parties, which have suggested to me the area that they think should be tackled. My view, which we may discuss later, is that those parties have much more work to do to clarify their thinking—that was one of my reasons for talking to them—and they should consider what they are seeking to achieve in such a one-off initiative.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 2</span>
The economy has a significant part to play in the peace process—hence the Chancellor's involvement. I again place on record my gratitude to the business community in Northern Ireland for its public support for the political talks.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Malcolm Moss <span class='memberconstituency'>(North-East Cambridgeshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Before the Minister moves on, will he elaborate on the content of the economic package that is being discussed? Will the process inevitably lead to an increase in the overall block grant for Northern Ireland, or will there be redistribution within a block?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not propose to elaborate on that matter. I have told local parties that the Chancellor wants to discuss with them the format of his proposals. There is presently no coherent structure because he has not yet completed that stage of engagement My right hon. Friend has views about what can be delivered within more broad United Kingdom policies. It will be a one-off initiative and, according to current assessments, it will be in addition to other benefits that may flow to the Northern Ireland economy. However, that is a matter for the Chancellor, not for me. I shall talk to the local parties and explain that the Chancellor has the freedom to do what he believes is right and appropriate but must take account of the impact of his actions, not just on regional economies in the United Kingdom but within the EU framework. However, there may be benefits for the Northern Ireland economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Moss</span><span class='membercontribution'>: During the last ceasefire of substance, some money was released from the security budget—the peace dividend—and the previous Government started to redistribute that in constructive ways. Does the Minister see that as a key source of additional money to be invested in the economy and on normal public services?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could debate whether there will be an immediate peace dividend, but the economic reality is that there will be no such dividend because of the peace costs. Restructuring of the security profile may allow a reduction in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and in the number of prisoners. If there is a reduction in the number of people employed in security, there will be savings in the longer term, but there will also be significant initial costs. Those who talk of peace dividends have been mis-selling the reality. That was part of the problem previously because it was assumed that a false economy could be created on the back of peace. We must face the reality that costs will accrue from the process and we must examine ways in which to fund those costs. There will be longer term benefits to the whole United Kingdom economy from not investing in excess of £600 million in policing alone. If Northern Ireland is equated with Kent in terms of size, the saving would probably be £400 million, but it is difficult to predict with any certainty when we shall reach that point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth (Belfast, South)</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I want to speak not about the peace dividend, but about the budget and the problems associated with the forthcoming millennium. Even Great Britain Departments have not had their
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0728">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 3</span>
budgets increased to deal with such problems. How will that affect the Northern Ireland economy in the context of backroom office work and the linking of systems?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The year 2000 is another problem that the Government must face, as must industry, and the cost implications are many and varied. The problem to be tackled concerns the costs associated with changing systems. The systems requiring change must be identified and the necessary resources must be made available. We have some notional figures and I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with the specific costs. The problem affects not just the Northern Ireland economy; it applies everywhere and if costs can be contained within existing budgets that is the best discipline. The scale may or may not be manageable and there is a significant debate about that. The problem should have been tackled some years ago and not left until now. In my previous life as shadow spokesman for science and technology I put pressure on the previous Government to quantify the problem, but they were slow to respond and it was late in the day before they began to consider the dimensions of the problem. As with everything else, the present Government have had to deal with the lack of planning and decision-making by the previous Government.<br><br>
There are unlikely to be ongoing costs and I shall write to the hon. Gentleman about the specific costs of the year 2000 problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: When my party met the Minister on this matter we did not think of it as a handout visit but as a meeting that had more to do with our ideas for spreading the available money. From what the Minister has said today, I take it that there may be extra money, and that would affect our thinking. The proposals that we were working on as a result of that meeting would bring new ideas about spending money that has already been allocated to certain areas.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entered a caveat at the start of the meeting about the need for political parties to put in more thought. I did not use the phrase "extra money" but said, without quantifying how much it might be, that there could be money in addition to that already allocated. Clearly, some of the matters that I have discussed with political parties fall within the fiscal regime. The money would not be a handout but an addition and an incentive to bring investment to Northern Ireland or to encourage indigenous investment.<br><br>
Some parties think the only way to improve an economy is by a cash injection—two words that some regard as the panacea for economic well being, which is nonsense. Local parties must clarify their thinking and identify areas in which help would result in an immediate accretion of benefit to the Northern Ireland economy and should target those areas in their discussions with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor. The more the parties say the same, the better will be the chances of the Chancellor taking matters up, although I cannot say what my right hon. Friend will do. My Department will feed him the matters that we filter out from discussions with the parties.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 4</span>
Local parties should try to attract more attention to the economy of Northern Ireland rather than talking of additional money. I had a good discussion with the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) when he came to see me and I made the point that the Chancellor's initial intention was to talk to those who are engaged in the peace process. It is important for all parties to communicate their views to the Chancellor. He will decide who to meet.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I got in touch with the Chancellor's office after his first statement that he would talk only to parties engaged at Stormont. That statement was unclear because there are two parts to the talks. There is the forum, through which people entered the talks and which some parties did not attend. Secondly, some parties are not attending the talks. The Chancellor made it clear that he would meet my party. He said the statement was wrong, and that he had no objection to meeting us and all parties.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. I would like short interventions.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The forum has decided to meet the Chancellor collectively and it is up to the Chancellor to determine whether he wants to deal with the matter in that way. I cannot dictate whom he should meet or what he should say. The hon. Gentleman has said that the Chancellor has made a commitment to meet his party. The hon. Gentleman should know that Chancellors do not respond positively to the words "cash injection" or "handout". There is more to what we are trying to achieve for the Northern Ireland economy, and that is why I have had meetings with the political parties.<br><br>
I should like to praise the Northern Ireland Group of Seven, which comprises Northern Ireland's leading business and trade union representative bodies, because it has highlighted the economic prizes to be won from political success, and the real costs if the present opportunity is missed. The confederation of British Industry, the Institute of Directors, the tourist sector and other sectoral trade associations have all recognised the benefits that will flow from this opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor <span class='memberconstituency'>(Strangford)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister explain how the CBI or the IoD speaks on behalf of the business community in Northern Ireland? Only 500 out of 27,000 company directors in Northern Ireland are members of the IoD; and only 10 per cent. of companies employing 10 or more people are connected with the CBI.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I gave a litany of organisations. I did not say only the CBI or the IoD; I said the Northern Ireland Group of Seven. I could mention Northern Ireland Growth Challenge. I mentioned the tourist sector and trade associations. In covering that panoply of organisations, just about every company in Northern Ireland is effectively covered in some way.<br><br>
If companies choose not to engage through the single-voice approach, they in effect withdraw from engaging with the Government and from the ongoing process. It is impossible for a Minister to talk to every
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0729">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 5</span>
individual company director; it is not practical. The single-voice approach is therefore important. The Northern Ireland Group of Seven is important because it comprises not only industry but trade unions as well. The trade union voice has always been an important component of what we are trying to achieve in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney <span class='memberconstituency'>(North Down)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister argued that he has support from the business community. Is he aware that the Northern Ireland chamber of commerce, which is probably the biggest organisation in the Northern Ireland Group of Seven, is withdrawing from it? The best thing that the Group of Seven could do would be to disband. It includes the IoD and the CBI. Many in the Northern Ireland business community do not see the peace process as having brought anything but turmoil, trouble and division to Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not recognise that description of the business community's view. Perhaps it is the hon. and learned Gentleman's view; perhaps that is what he wants, but it is not the business community's view.<br><br>
The chamber of commerce represents another point of engagement, but it decides itself what to do in its ongoing relationship with co-ordinated groups.<br><br>
If we end up with fragmentation—too many voices saying too many different things—it will be hard to develop a coherent policy. We have therefore asked the multiplicity of organisations in the tourist sector to try to bring themselves together to talk with one voice. Such a voice would be stronger and more coherent, and it would enable me, as the Minister responsible for tourism, to understand their point of view and to take arguments forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps it would be worth the Government noting that there is a case for exploring other ways to make contact with a greater proportion of business representatives, so that they feel that they have a dialogue. As has come out of our exchange, that might be a useful rallying-point.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be seen as helpful. I am not averse to the idea. If people do not want to engage in the central argument, we shall be dealing with a multiplicity of agencies. I would be sitting around a table for evermore, talking to individual voices. I do not believe that that would serve the best interest of the business community, of commerce or of the tourist sector.<br><br>
The one-voice approach does not necessarily have to consist of just one voice; there are different sectors within different categories of industry, but there must be some coherence to that voice if we are to understand and take forward its messages. I am not averse to meeting companies individually; indeed, as I travel the region to announce increased investment, I meet many of the big players that are key to the Northern Ireland economy.<br><br>
Associations and organisations that recognise the benefits of a peaceful future play an important role. Such bodies do not criticise the peace process. They are not saying to politicians "walk out of the peace process, create
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 6</span>
disharmony in our society": they are saying, "find a solution". They know that finding a solution is difficult for local politicians; there is no unified voice and clearly not everyone holds the same view.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. John D. Taylor</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept that the Minister wants to speak to those who really represent business in Northern Ireland; regrettably, he is talking to those who do not represent most business in Northern Ireland. Is the main industry in Northern Ireland—agriculture—represented by the Ulster Farmers Union and the Northern Ireland Group of Seven?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My noble Friend Lord Dubs has specific responsibilities for that sector. I shall mention the importance of the agrifood business to the Northern Ireland economy—about 60,000 jobs are tied up in the sector—later in my remarks. Full account must be taken of that sector, which is why we should all pay tribute to the work done by the Government to try to resolve the difficulties over BSE. We inherited those difficulties, but our work in tackling them has now received recognition, specifically with regard to Northern Ireland, and we will continue to Build on that achievement.<br><br>
Direct relations exist between the Ulster Farmers Union and my noble Friend Lord Dubs, who has an active interest in the agrifood business. A holistic approach to the sector is required, as not only farming but the whole food chain is affected. Many changes are taking place in the Northern Ireland economy because of multiples entering the sector, which has an impact on local sourcing. We must be adaptable and recognise the changes facing the sector, and we must realise that change is coming not just in Northern Ireland but in the whole of the UK and Europe. We must pay attention to the food chain argument with regard to local supply and service to the customer.<br><br>
The voices of organisations that are not in the Northern Ireland Group of Seven are not necessarily diminished; their voices are still important. The Northern Ireland Group of Seven is trying to do an important and difficult job, and if people knock and criticise it that job is made more difficult. It provides a voice for one particular sector and point of view within a wide range of opinion in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister accept that the Northern Ireland Group of Seven—epitomised by Sir George Quigley—is a part of the Government's policy on the peace process? It talks constantly about an all-Ireland economy and a Dublin-Belfast corridor, neither of which concepts is supported by any reputable economist in the north or south of Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Ah, reputable economists.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Any economist.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. and learned Gentleman says any economist, but I would rather deal with a reputable economist. Given what Sir George Quigley has achieved and is still achieving, I do not think that he can be knocked aside as though he were not competent to understand economic benefits. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I was
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0730">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 7</span>
hoping that we would have a reasonable, structured debate. I am happy to hear different views on the economy, but we are now 25 minutes into the debate, I am on page 4, and I have another 20 pages to deliver to cover all the matters that have been touched on. I hope that I am wrong, but it seems that some hon. Members are less interested in a serious debate about the way forward than in nit-picking about whether a particular group represents everyone or whether a particular individual has any knowledge of the economy. Such an approach is not helpful, and is not what the people of Northern Ireland want from politicians; they want them to analyse the situation and to find a better approach.[<i>Interruption.</i>]
I have been accused of being arrogant, but the hon. Gentleman's criticism of those in Northern Ireland who are trying to make a contribution exhibits that characteristic. If the wants to contribute to the debate, he should say what he thinks is the future for Northern Ireland, which I thought was the purpose of our proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps I can, without apology, support the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney). In practical terms, most astute business people in Northern Ireland recognise that trade opportunities in the east or west are more than 10 times greater than they are likely to be in the north-south corridor. That puts the issue into perspective. We all agree that business between the north and south should be developed where possible, but the real opportunities are in the east.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I also look west to the United States. We must think globally because we cannot put all our eggs in one basket. Clearly, the rest of Europe is a bigger market, but it is worth remembering that 25 per cent. of exports from Northern Ireland go to the Republic. it is a sizeable market for the Northern Ireland economy, and we should not ignore the inter-relationship between the two economies. We should not put a political overlay on what companies and industry believe will benefit them. Companies should not be told that they cannot trade into the Republic. If they want to do that and create jobs in the north, it should be welcomed.<br><br>
I want to make some progress by dealing with the national overview while spelling out the Government's vision for the Northern Ireland economy and how that fits in the broad framework for national growth and renewal. The Government have been putting in place a set of consistent policies to improve the underlying rate of growth and employment by creating economic stability, based on low inflation and low Government borrowing, and to modernise the welfare state, which will help people out of welfare and into work. The Government will announce further thoughts on that later today. The policies will also help to develop a tax system that is fair, and is seen to be fair.<br><br>
The Chancellor reaffirmed in the Budget those national priorities, which are good news for Northern Ireland. The lower corporation tax rates will benefit the Northern
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 8</span>
Ireland economy. The 20 per cent. rate will be especially competitive given that Northern Ireland has, in the main, a small-firm economy.<br><br>
The Government have also put in place improved incentives to work. Higher thresholds for employees' national insurance contributions will be welcomed, I am sure, by the low paid and the unemployed. Similarly, the working families tax credit will guarantee an income to families on low pay, which should make work more attractive than simply drawing benefit.<br><br>
The Chancellor also allocated an extra £20 million to Northern Ireland to spend on key services in the coming year; £13 million was allocated to the health service; more than £6 million was allocated to schools; and £1.3 million was allocated for rural transport. Those extra resources will have to go to the most needy and filter through into the wider local economy to get the best effect.<br><br>
Alongside that is the overarching objective of achieving equality of opportunity for all the citizens of Northern Ireland. The drive for national fairness has a particular resonance for Northern Ireland. Equality, as I am sure all members of the Committee will agree, is the cornerstone of a decent society's vision for the future. It is clearly the vision of the Government. The Committee will be aware that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recently published the White Paper, "Partnership for Equality". It sets out a response to the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights' review on employment equality in Northern Ireland. On the basis of that, the Government intend to strengthen measures to combat unemployment, in particular long-term unemployment, and to promote equality of opportunity throughout the public sector.<br><br>
We propose to establish a new equality commission to take over the responsibilities of the Fair Employment Commission, the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality and the disability council. The new commission will also advise the public sector on how best to promote equality of opportunity.<br><br>
I firmly believe that the Government's proposed action and approach will enable people to believe that they can develop their potential. The White Paper is a commitment to that.<br><br>
I said earlier that there is good news on the economy in Northern Ireland. Manufacturing output is up by 4.6 per cent., unemployment down by nearly 15 per cent., the number of people in employment is up by nearly 9,000 and exports are up by £470 million. Since May last year, 50 industrial projects have been announced by IDB's client firms, involving almost 5,300 new jobs. Great credit is due to everyone in Northern Ireland who contributed to that success. It is further proof of the dogged hard work and commitment of the business community, the work force and those who work on behalf of Government agencies worldwide to try to attract investment to Northern Ireland.<br><br>
The unemployment figures are still too high, but show encouraging trends. The trend has been downward for much of the past five years; in that period, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit has fallen by around 45 per cent.—more than 48,000 people. Improvements in the headline figures for two key groups are especially welcome. First, the number of long-term
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0731">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 9</span>
unemployed—those out of work for more than a year—has fallen consistently in recent years and fell by about 30 per cent. last year; and, secondly, the number of unemployed under-25s in the same period has fallen by around 1,200. With the welfare-to-work initiatives, we can look forward to further improvements in the labour market position of those two groups.<br><br>
I mentioned the beef industry. I hope that members of the Committee will recognise all the work that went into securing the approval of the export certified herds scheme. That approval will enable us to begin exporting again in May or June, subject to the final visit by EU inspectors within the next 10 days or so. However, that approval alone will not win back all our customers and much work remains to be done. There is a firm commitment throughout Northern Ireland to achieve progress on that. I paid tribute to the work done by my noble Friend Lord Dubs. He will continue to be aggressive in promoting the industry, not only in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, but internationally.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. David Trimble <span class='memberconstituency'>(Upper Bann)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish to place on record our appreciation of what has been done, not only by Lord Dubs but by the Minister and his predecessor in the previous Government, to get the specified herds scheme lodged and accepted. Does the Minister agree that it is now essential to market the scheme and to try to regain lost markets? The industry in Northern Ireland is conscious of the need to do so, but will require significant assistance. To what extent will such bodies as the IDB contribute to regaining our lost continental markets for Northern Ireland beef?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not sure that that is the responsibility of the IDB. It has some responsibility for export strategy but a wider area of interest is involved. The industry must define what marketing strategy it requires and how it would best be delivered. I am sure that my noble Friend Lord Dubs and the Departments are working on that. We must be conscious of the agri-food chain. I shall write to the right hon. Gentleman with details of what is being done. We welcome any views that hon. Members may have on how best to approach the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I entirely agree with what my hon. Friend said about how appreciative the agricultural community is of what has been achieved. Now that we have overcome one problem, what is being done about the most recent problem—the disparity in the grading of cattle for intervention which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of pounds being lost to Northern Ireland producers?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I wish that I had an answer to that. Agriculture is not my forte, but it is clear that many serious problems stem from the impact of the BSE crisis upon the farming community. It is not just a question of getting the approved scheme recognised—that was the reason for the comments of the right hon. Member for Upper Bann (Mr. Trimble) about marketing strategy. I do not have an answer to the hon. Gentleman's specific question, but I shall ensure that he receives a proper and helpful response from the appropriate Department.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 10</span>
I have set out the broad framework of recent economic developments in Northern Ireland and I have mentioned unemployment, new jobs and various other factors. Economic challenges remain and new ones are emerging all the time, not only in the agrifood sector. Some recent economic forecasts have been less than encouraging, and restructuring continues in the local economy, as it does elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Some firms have had to lay off staff despite their, and the Department's, best efforts, and others have had to close down. Regrettably, about 16 closures have been recorded since 1 May 1997. Local businesses face very real pressures, and the Government recognise that there is still work to be done.<br><br>
The Government can have particular influence in the energy sector. Northern Ireland has suffered from isolation and peripherality in that respect, which is one of the main challenges facing its economy. The Government are promoting a policy of interconnection of both gas and electricity. That policy will remove isolation, reduce peripherality, increase full choice and provide access to Great Britain's cheaper electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Reverend Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Have any calculations been carried out to assess the impact on generating costs in Northern Ireland of the tax increase on oil? The hydrocarbon tax increase will have an adverse effect upon electricity prices in Northern Ireland, which are already high.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The entire cost equation is being examined by the regulator, who will look especially at its impact upon Northern Ireland energy. The previous Government signed up to the principle of the electricity interconnector, and we are very much in favour of it. However, the electricity interconnector is not beneficial of itself unless cost benefits flow from it. It is much more complicated than simply being part of a tax equation. The contracts between Northern Ireland Electricity and Scottish Power are a key factor. The duration of those contracts and the level at which they are set will have an impact upon the overall costs of generating and supplying electricity.<br><br>
The principle of the interconnector has been established, but the cost equation has not yet been fully balanced. That is being considered by the regulator and by Northern Ireland Electricity and Scottish Power. Those two private companies are driving the process. If one of the partners to the contract says that it cannot sell electricity at a certain price, the deal will not be done and consequently the interconnector will not be built.<br><br>
Great benefits will result if the issue can be resolved. Greater choice and a new stimulus will be brought into the market, which will push down electricity prices. I hope, therefore, that the two companies and the regulator can work out the necessary equation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien <span class='memberconstituency'>(Normanton)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: My hon. Friend is discussing energy and its provision in Northern Ireland. Has any thought been given to a private finance initiative to generate energy from waste? We live in a world that wants to reduce waste and landfill material. One of the ways to do that is to generate electricity from domestic
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0732">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 11</span>
and industrial waste. In some areas that is done through private finance initiatives. Does the Minister have any views about that?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am not aware of any current schemes run by private companies, nor are the Government stimulating anything specific. We are always examining sustainable energy sources. Those tend to have higher costs per unit of power than other sources, so there has to be an element of subsidy. However, sources can be localised, making them closer to small producers. The benefit to the environment is another part of the equation. The non-fossil fuel obligation offers opportunities in that area. I take on board my hon. Friend's comments. Any project that fits the NFFO approach will be given a full assessment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Maginnis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the Minister aware that I tabled a written question asking whether the Government sought to co-ordinate work carried out at local government level? District councils explore the idea of waste incineration with only small budgets. I was surprised—as most members of the Committee may be—to find that the Department of the Environment has done nothing to co-ordinate those efforts. Could not the Government be more pro-active? Will the Minister reassure us that the Government will change their attitude to waste?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It is not just a case of having a scheme: the scheme must be cost-beneficial. In future, the Committee may wish to debate energy policy and its structure, but it is not appropriate to have that debate now.<br><br>
I am not familiar with the hon. Gentleman's written question: I do not carry with me answers from every Department. The question may have implications, so I shall not respond to it directly. The question implied that the Department is doing nothing. I do not know whether that is correct, but the Department will examine schemes that benefit the environment, involve proper planning and have a proper approach to waste incineration. If money is spent on such schemes, it cannot be spent elsewhere. The Department may have examined waste incineration schemes and decided that they are not cost-effective.<br><br>
It is all very well thinking that waste incineration is a good idea, but other aspects come into play. Waste incineration involves the disposal of by products, and the implications of that have to be examined.<br><br>
The issue is complicated, but I take on board the hon. Gentleman's comments. I cannot accept that nothing has been done because I do not believe that Departments proceed on that basis. They may have examined the schemes and, for some of the reasons that I have given, decided that there was no benefit in moving them forward. Departments for which I do not have direct responsibility may have other reasons for not advancing the schemes.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Minister always misses the point. I am not talking about what the Department does or does not do. I asked whether the Department had sought to co-ordinate the work carried out by district councils.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 12</span>
Co-ordination means considering the cost benefits. I appreciate that the Minister may not know the answer off the top of his head. The cost benefits may not be justifiable, but a great deal of local funds from district councils are put into waste incineration. It is time that the Department of the Environment co-ordinated that effort, and ensured that information flows back and forth between district councils.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the principle of that. However, because I am not responsible for the DoE, I am not prepared to say that that has not been done.<br><br>
Co-ordination between councils is important. Leaving aside Northern Ireland's political problems, it is sometimes hard to get local authorities to co-operate on such schemes. Some councils see themselves as satellites that would derive no cost benefit from plugging into a bigger scheme. The matter is worth debating, but it should be taken up with my noble Friend Lord Dubs, who I am sure would agree to a meeting. If the Department has not been fulfilling all its duties, I am sure that he will provide a detailed answer.<br><br>
If co-ordination triggers a better approach it will be considered. However, a co-ordinated approach requires willing partners, and the matter may be more difficult and complex than this discussion implies. The hon. Gentleman does not always ask me simple questions, but I hope that I have given a detailed answer.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I understand the answer about private finance initiatives that the Minister gave to the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien). However, private developers are seeking to generate power from waste, and one such project in Belfast has reached the planning appeal stage.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to prejudge or comment on any particular planning application. Because of the beneficial environmental impact, such approaches constitute a way forward; but environmental disbenefits can also arise. As my hon. Friend the Member for Normanton will recognise, such matters have to be taken in the round and examined in the light of the impact on local communities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The European Union is moving towards such an approach. I welcome the application in Belfast because it would be better for us to get into the matter quickly rather than waiting for an EU directive that forces people to do so. Some local authorities are too small to develop such schemes; they need to unite to do so.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not wish to enter into a debate about the size of local authorities in Northern Ireland. That could lead us down another route of local authority reorganisation. The European Union does not force directives on communities and economies. Directives result from an agreed position that is deemed to be the best way forward.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What about BSE?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0733">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 13</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We could debate the workings of the EU and its impact on local communities, but that is not the Committee's purpose. We should predict as best we can the likely European energy policy framework, and examine the financial ways in which the Northern Ireland economy might benefit from it.<br><br>
I accept that we should anticipate what is coming over the horizon and plan accordingly. As well as dealing with immediate problems, my ministerial team and I constantly look ahead. We have been doing the job for what may be too long for some, but it is not long enough for us. We are trying to reach that horizon in a planned and coherent way.<br><br>
Fifty per cent. of Northern Ireland's electricity is now generated by gas. Access to that fuel is being offered progressively to domestic and industrial consumers, and the 5,000 consumers in Greater Belfast who have chosen to commit to gas are likely to be joined by many more. We are also exploring the benefits of north-south gas interconnectors to the north and south economies, and of supplying gas to the north-west of the Province. Independent studies are assessing those potential benefits and the best way that they can be delivered.<br><br>
Those schemes are unlikely to be driven by public funding, which would have to be on a large scale. The private sector would have to decide whether it could deliver the gas at a profit. Public subsidy is not suitable, and the Government would be unlikely to be able to find the required sums. However, the studies are not over and we do not yet know how the economic equations would stack up. We shall continue to look at the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the Minister not agree that if Coolkeeragh power station opted for gas, its supply could be triggered to the north-west of the Province and could therefore bring economic benefits to Londonderry?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We do not yet know because the relevant study has not finished. Although Northern Ireland as a whole suffers from isolation and peripherality, some parts of the Province suffer more than others. A gas pipe from a landfill in Belfast to Londonderry would travel through an area where no gas could be sold. There are cost implications in taking gas to certain communities, and it might not make economic sense even if the gas was sold on into Donegal or elsewhere in the Republic. We must await the outcome of the study assessing those factors.<br><br>
I mentioned the interconnector between Scotland and Northern Ireland, and my noble Friend Lord Dubs has given notice of planning approval for the converter station at Islandmagee. Although I hope that that is the end of that process, the relationship between Northern Ireland Electricity, Scottish Power and the regulator still exists to decide the best way forward.<br><br>
I have tried to explain some of the challenges that we face. Challenges always should be seeri as opportunities rather than threats. We will analyse the problem and look for ways for the Government and the people of Northern Ireland to work in partnership so that difficulties can be turned around to the benefit of Northern Ireland's economy.<br><br>
I shall now describe the overall Government economic policy in Northern Ireland. The Department of Economic Development will continue to help companies' long-term
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 14</span>
growth and to help them deal with unexpected difficulties. In the global marketplace, we will work with business on matters most important to long-term competitiveness. We all want the Northern Ireland economy to have higher levels of employment distributed fairly throughout the community, with high value-added industries, low waste levels and a skilled and motivated work force.<br><br>
The key is to pay more attention than previous Governments have done to the development of the economy's raw material—the people of Northern Ireland. It is essential that they have the skills, the education and the adaptability to survive and prosper in a highly competitive global economy. The work of the Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington), who is responsible for education, is crucial to economic success.<br><br>
It is the national and local aim to promote higher standards of educational achievement and to increase learning opportunities. The Government have begun to deliver their manifesto commitments on education spending. The public spending allocations for 1998–99 show the extra allocation for schools and for further and higher education, which the Committee discussed in a previous appropriation debate.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: In relation to the increase in higher education and its effect on the economy, is the Minister aware that Northern Ireland has about 12,000 fewer places in tertiary education compared with Scotland, and about 5,000 fewer places compared with Wales? The problem is exacerbated among the 5,000 Northern Ireland students who attend Scottish universities, because they are not funded for their fourth year, which is part of the Scottish system.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Clearly, I am aware of the problem, which has two parts: funding and the availability of places. Where can one find the money to build new colleges and other institutions of tertiary education? Solutions cannot be delivered overnight and they do not come easily; they have to be planned for. Clearly, if the economy grows, there will be a gap to meet. A significant number of graduates in Northern Ireland are currently unemployed. If the economy grows and becomes a high-value-added economy and a high-skill economy, those people will find work. A virtuous circle might result: as more graduates are created, it is easier to meet demand, and so on. We look forward to dealing with the situation, and the Government have said that there will be additional expenditure.<br><br>
We are examining ways to fund non-Scottish students in Scotland. That matter is outwith my specific remit, but attempts are being made to resolve the problem. About 5,000 high-quality Northern Ireland students go to Scottish universities. I shall get an answer for the hon. and learned Gentleman, and tell him what my Scottish colleagues are doing. I appreciate the fact that this important matter has been raised—we are only too aware of it.<br><br>
As to the spending allocations for 1998–99, the Budget will provide a further £6 million for schools and for further and higher education. The Government recently
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0734">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 15</span>
announced a school improvement programme for Northern Ireland, which will help schools to deal with the fundamentals of literacy, numeracy, discipline, the quality of school leadership and target setting.<br><br>
In further and higher education, a key feature of the Government's policy is the promotion of life-long learning. An increased pace of change means that people will need to gain new skills and to retrain several times during their working lifetime. That is why we have launched a national debate on the subject, which is based on the Government's paper, "The Learning Age". We are also seeking to establish a university for industry, which will be a step forward that will, I hope, prove to be as significant as the establishment of the Open university. The Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, my hon. Friend the Member for Clydebank and Milngavie (Mr. Worthington) will tomorrow launch that consultation paper, but, obviously, I cannot comment on it in advance.<br><br>
I have spoken for some time, partly because of the number of interventions that I have taken. I had intended to comment on the new deal and the national minimum wage, but I feel that doing so would abuse the Committee's time. I mention those important matters only in passing, although they are an important part of the Government's attempts to tackle the problems of long-term unemployment and youth unemployment.<br><br>
There is no doubt that the national minimum wage will have an impact on Northern Ireland. The report of the Northern Ireland Economic Council highlights the pluses and minuses of the national minimum wage and it clearly sets out its importance to Northern Ireland. We must await the Low Pay Unit's findings before advancing with what will be a major benefit to the economy. Hon. Members will agree that we need a proper framework for wage levels on which to build future developments.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I am glad to have caught the Minister's eye before he sits down. I am disappointed that he has not addressed regulation of industry in Northern Ireland and its relationship with the City and financiers. There have been several high-profile cases, including what many consider a scandal at Mackies, where the share price fell from £3.60 to 20p. Powerscreen is another case. What will the Minister do to prevent industry from falling into the disrepute that attaches to Goodman, Telecom, Greencore and others in the Irish Republic?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The hon. Gentleman said that he was sorry that I had not touched on that point. I have been speaking for an hour and I am trying to sit down so that I can hear from hon. Members. If I had taken fewer interventions, I might have been able to say more.<br><br>
The Government are attending to City regulation. We are considering company performance and the organisation of corporate governance. Regulation alone will not stop the problem, as it may not prevent people from acting corruptly or illegally. We need to establish best practice among the robust institutions of the City whose standards, though high, can be improved. Clearly, some companies or directors have abused their positions and we can learn from what they have done. If the hon.
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 16</span>
Gentleman has specific information about Mackies and Powerscreen that is not already in the public domain, I would be happy to know of it.<br><br>
I want to finish on our longer-term planning strategy for Northern Ireland, which involves the structures of the Local Enterprise Development Unit, the Industrial Research and Technology Unit and the Industrial Development Board, all of which do excellent work. Those structures have been in place for six years and it is worth re-examining them. I have also set up a major review of our economic development strategy, which will consider the best way forward for the Northern Ireland economy.<br><br>
The review will take 12 to 18 months, which is too long, and must involve not only Ministers and civil servants but get industry around the table to help us to achieve what we want in the long term for the Northern Ireland economy. The reason for the long time scale is that we cannot necessarily get everyone around the table in the way that we want. We seek co-operation from the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The review will range widely and will address all issues relating to the future economic success of Northern Ireland.<br><br>
We must consider expected trends in the national, European and world economies. We will examine manufacturing and services, innovation and skills, equality and trade. The review will involve other Departments—those covering education, agriculture and the environment—which have important roles to play in economic development. The approach is holistic. Each Department has an important role to play and we must ensure that the approach is co-ordinated.<br><br>
Another attendant issue on the horizon is the establishment of an assembly. If responsibilities are transferred and determined locally, that will create a welcome problem—one which will necessitate the building of new relationships. Local politicians with responsibility for economic development will, hopefully, have a major review in place. Conclusions from that will allow them to build on what they are doing for their community.<br><br>
I hope that members of the Committee will recognise that I have described the main policies and priorities which will create the right environment for a strong economy in Northern Ireland. I look forward to hearing contributions from right hon. and hon. Members and, if there is time, responding to them. I hope that my speech has been helpful, and I know that the Committee's views will help me to do my job.</span></p>
<p>11.37 am</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Jeffrey Donaldson <span class='memberconstituency'>(Lagan Valley)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: We are all aware of the need to continue to encourage higher levels of inward investment and economic development to build a better, more stable future for Northern Ireland. The growth of our economy in 1997 was good. It was close or equal to the United Kingdom average of 3.5 per cent. That expansion has lasted for the past five years and we hope that it will continue. It has been remarkable when one considers the contradictory elements in the economy.<br><br>
The significant recovery from the 1996 slowdown can be set against the astonishing rise in sterling against continental currencies. The rapid fall in unemployment of
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0735">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 17</span>
about 28,000 set against 9,000 new jobs and the introduction of the jobseeker's allowance may partly explain that, but we welcome the decline in unemployment. Although a reduction in interest rates to counter the high level of sterling is being predicted, in the short term there is a risk of another interest rate increase which, with sluggish consumer spending and a decline in Government spending in real terms, may lead to a recession later this year.<br><br>
Nevertheless, it must be said that economic growth in 1997 was high enough to support a substantial increase in jobs during the nine months to September 1997, when 4,000 extra jobs were created. Indeed, employment in September 1997 was the highest in the history of Northern Ireland. It rose by 43,000–8 per cent.—from the end of 1992. As a result, short-term unemployment is below the UK average, although long-term unemployment, partly caused by structural factors, continues at twice the UK average.<br><br>
Our economy is in relatively good shape, although some people claim that it is being outperformed by our neighbours in the Irish Republic. That may be the case in terms of gross domestic product, but unemployment in the Irish Republic has risen by 26 per cent. in the past five years while it has steadily declined in Northern Ireland. The economy that we are establishing in Northern Ireland is being built on firmer foundations than the so-called Celtic tiger. That has been heavily reliant on European Union subsidies which will decrease significantly in the next few years.<br><br>
I mentioned our concern about the strength of sterling and the impact of that on the Northern Ireland economy; it is likely to put pressure on company profits over the coming year. We have witnessed the impact of the strength of sterling against the Irish punt, particularly on the petrol trade. I recently received a letter from the Petrol Retailers Association, which said that petrol retailers in Northern Ireland are doubly hindered by the sterling-punt exchange rate and by the massive difference in excise duty between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland. The recent increase in excise duty on fuel adds to their difficulties and I have written to the Chancellor of the Exchanquer, urging him to review the circumstances relating to that trade. I hope that the sterling situation will soon rectify itself.<br><br>
Whilst our manufacturing output has expanded by 4.6 per cent. over the past year, inward investment in Northern Ireland is still invariably restricted, partly because of continuing political instability. None the less, inward investment—particularly in the service sector—has remained remarkably stable. We welcome the recent investments in that sector. In the four years to 1996, exports grew by 35 per cent. In value terms, which is higher than the UK average. However, exports have been hit by the high pound and manufacturing has experienced problems; there have been cuts in the clothing industry, for example, because competition from cheaper labour markets in the far east has continued to create problems. Most of the growth in our economy has been in the small and medium-sized sectors; the rapid growth of electronics and software engineering in Northern Ireland is a reflection of the sophisticated labour force in those sectors, and shows that companies investing in the
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 18</span>
Province can operate competitively in Europe and the rest of the world. I welcome the review of economic development agencies in Northern Ireland and hope that it will be a fundamental review.<br><br>
In terms of research and development, we have the Industrial Research and Technology Unit. We are concerned about a developing problem in our largest manufacturing company. Bombardier Aerospace in Belfast, which is creating redundancies in its research and development department. The Minister recently said that Bombardier had fulfilled the undertakings that it made when it acquired Shorts in October 1989 in terms of retaining an integrated design and manufacturing operation in Belfast, but we are concerned about the short and medium-term future of that operation. A continued reduction in the design facility will seriously inhibit the company's ability to compete in the global aerospace market. I ask the Minister, in his discussions with the management of Bombardier Aerospace, to urge it to retain its design facility in Belfast.<br><br>
One cannot discuss industry in Northern Ireland without referring to our largest industry: agriculture. Employing around 8 per cent. of the population, the agriculture industry has had a traumatic few years and suffered greatly from the incompetence of bureaucrats, not only in Europe but in the Government. The BSE crisis was badly handled when it first broke and the then Government's failure to defend the livestock industry and its standards in Northern Ireland was deplorable. Northern Ireland has the best system of monitoring the movement of cattle between herds, and our abattoir hygiene standards are second to none within the United Kingdom. We welcome the raising of the ban on the export of Northern Ireland beef, but I echo the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Upper Bann that Government support is needed for the agriculture industry, and in particular for the beef sector, to market Northern Ireland beef in Europe and throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that we still face the hurdle of the veterinary inspectors? France has been making strange noises to the effect that all beasts whose carcases are to be transported must be slain in special abattoirs. That could again prevent us from getting our beef on to the market.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: As French was not my best subject at school, I am not sure whether the Prime Minister included an exhortation on behalf of Northern Ireland beef producers when he addressed the French national assembly. However, we hope that the Government will consider the points made by the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley).<br><br>
In his review of economic development strategy, I urge the Minister to examine planning. Significant delays in planning decisions on major investment projects continue to be a problem for businesses that want to invest in Northern Ireland, and therefore affect Northern Ireland's ability to compete in attracting inward investment. Although it is not within his ministerial remit, I hope that as part of the review the Minister will urge his colleague, Lord Dubs, to review the planning process in Northern Ireland, with particular reference to delays in

consideration of large planning projects. We are way behind the rest of the United Kingdom in how long it takes to reach decisions on major planning projects, which inhibits our competitiveness in economic development.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Clifford Forsythe <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that local residents should have a voice? Although we should encourage industry, we must always remember that planning should be properly considered, so that the local residents' voice is heard.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Of course my hon. Friend is correct; the planning process in England, Scotland and Wales includes such considerations, but nevertheless takes considerably less time than in Northern Ireland. Above all, we need in Northern Ireland an accountable planning service. The sooner we have one, the better.<br><br>
The planned reduction of public sector spending is a further serious consideration. Public sector spending is now 135 per cent. of that in Great Britain. Of our entire annual subvention of £3.4 billion, 43 per cent. goes to the public sector. The Government's present projections are to cut public sector spending by 2 per cent. over 1998–99, with a similar fall in the following year. The implications for the Northern Ireland economy are serious: almost 30 per cent. of people employed in Northern Ireland work in the public sector. The Minister must consider that in his economic development strategy.<br><br>
It has been argued that the Northern Ireland economy could benefit from the development of a single island economy. My party rejects that notion. Although we are happy to see co-operation with our neighbours in the Irish Republic, it is economic nonsense to suggest linking Northern Ireland into an economy of 3.5 million people rather than developing our links with Great Britain's economy of 50 million people. We do substantially more trade with Great Britain than with the Irish Republic. The nearest large city to Belfast is not Dublin but Glasgow. We are only 200 miles away from a large economy of 15 million people in the north of England.<br><br>
The Government must develop infrastructural links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. They need to upgrade the A8 road from Belfast to Lame, which is a major transport link.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Tony McNulty <span class='memberconstituency'>(Harrow, East)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Why not do both? Why not develop economic links with the Republic and with the north of England?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The problem is that policy discriminates in favour of developing links with the Irish Republic. We want recognition of the stronger links with Great Britain, which ought to be given the priority that they deserve.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Martin Smyth</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty), why should the main road from Dublin to Northern Ireland be developed before money is spent on other roads between the two parts of Ireland? The roads to Larne are important for the British market and for Northern Ireland exports to Europe and to the United States of America.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 20</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I appreciate my hon. Friend's intervention. It is ironic that Northern Ireland has made significant investments in developing the Al link between Belfast and Dublin, but that investment has not been matched by investment from the Government of the Irish Republic. One still bumps across the border at Newry.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Ian Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is it not a fact that traffic from the south of Ireland uses the Larne road, which benefits both parts of the island? Fixing the road to Larne is the best thing for everyone.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: We welcome the fact that many businesses in the Irish Republic export through the port of Larne, but that points to the need to upgrade Larne's infrastructure. The A75 trans-European network road needs investment if the link between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom is to be developed.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Kevin McNamara <span class='memberconstituency'>(Hull, North)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: In view of the hon. Gentleman's comments about roads in the Republic, has he or his party made representations to the Republic's transport department about improving communications?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What the Irish Republic does to its roads is an internal matter. It is not for Northern Ireland to tell the Irish Republic where its priorities should lie. It is paradoxical that people in the Irish Republic talk so much about the need to develop a single island economy when their investment in infrastructure does not have any substance.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. William Thompson <span class='memberconstituency'>(West Tyrone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: The Anglo-Irish agreement works only one way.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That agreement is a one-way street. It is paradoxical that the Irish Government make much of the need for economic co-operation under the aegis of an all-Ireland administrative structure. They will add to the differences between the two parts of the island by signing up for the euro and, unlike the United Kingdom, signing up to economic and monetary union. It is clear that countries that join EMU will be expected to harmonise their taxes, industrial incentives and the like in the years ahead. That will further reduce the scope for north-south co-operation.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Bill O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman implying that we should adopt the euro?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: <i>indicated dissent.</i></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: If he is not in favour of the euro, why does he criticise the Government?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: My point was that it is ironic that the Irish Republic, in seeking to develop the idea of a single Ireland economy, should join EMU without the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. O'Brien</span><span class='membercontribution'>: What is the relevance of that?</span></p>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0737">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 21</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The relevance is this: joining EMU will add to existing barriers. That is what happened when the Irish Republic left sterling and set up its own currency.<br><br>
The Irish Prime Minister recently spoke about economic co-operation where it makes economic sense. On the basis of his domestic policies, I think that there will be few such opportunities in future, especially after the Irish Republic has joined EMU. One cannot ignore the fact that scope for co-operation will decrease, rather than increase, after joining EMU. It is, therefore, important for Northern Ireland's future that we develop our links with the rest of the United Kingdom, which is to remain outside EMU.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McNamara</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation-Confederation of British Industry (Northern Ireland) Joint Business Council? I recently received a letter from that body describing its
<br><blockquote><p>"overall role in promoting improved transportation, logistics, communications and energy linkage…</p></blockquote>
<br><blockquote><p>The Business Development Programme will investigate the possibility of setting up links between the two overseas trade development agencies on the island of Ireland for organising future trade missions that may come under the banner of NETA activities."</p></blockquote>
It appears that the CBI in Northern Ireland, together with IBEC, has a different conception of all-Ireland co-operation and trade from that of the hon. Gentleman.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I can only repeat what my right hon. Friend the Member for Strangford (Mr. Taylor) said earlier. The CBI does not represent many business people in Northern Ireland. We have trade links with the Irish Republic—people do business on a normal trading basis. Some hon. Members are attempting to put a political overlay on that trade to further the notion that the best future for Northern Ireland's economy involves the development of a single Ireland economy. That flies in the face of reality. We are part of the United Kingdom, which represents an economy of 52 million people. Most of our trade is with Great Britain, and we want to remain part of that economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trimble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does my hon. Friend agree that it is significant that the joint group comprising the CBI and IBEC is now exploring the need to develop the north European corridor that links through England—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McNamara</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Port of Hull.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Trimble</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is right. The hon. Gentleman is obviously aware that IBEC and the CBI realise that the east-west link is their own economic lifeline.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Perhaps they will be buying houses in Hull next.<br><br>
The Minister referred to the need for stability in Northern Ireland if we are to attract further investment, and linked that to agreement in the talks process. In all sincerity, agreement in the talks process will not in itself deliver stability.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 22</span>
The images from Northern Ireland that have deterred investors int eh past are still with us. They will, regrettably, remain, regardless of any agreement in the talks process. The gunmen and the bombers will continue to stalk the streets of Northern Ireland wreaking destruction on our economy. We have seen that in Moira, Portadown, Armagh and Forkhill, and unfortunately it will continue.<br><br>
Real stability will be achieved only when the scourge of terrorism is removed from the streets of Northern Ireland. Appeasement has not worked, and I hope that the Government will take on and beat the terrorists—in the interests of our economy as well as of peace and stability.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman saying that the UK Government's placing of 17,000 troops and 13,000 RUC members on the streets of Northern Ireland is a form of appeasement? Is he arguing that the charging of many people with terrorist-related crimes in recent times by the RUC also constitutes appeasement? I do not understand his allegations. Is he saying that more troops are needed? Is he saying that more RUC officers are needed?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I do not want to bore the Minister with a long list, but it is the Government's policies that constitute appeasement, not the inability of the soldiers and policemen. Unfortunately, in respect of combating terrorism their hands have been tied for too long.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is the hon. Gentleman aware that his views were confirmed by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and by Senator George Mitchell, the chairman of the talks, who has stated publicly in recent days that an agreement will not end terrorist violence in Northern Ireland?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Donaldson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for his helpful intervention. He is correct, and the Minister should accept that reality. There has been far too much hype around the notion that peace is just around the corner if only the politicians can agree. The men with the guns and the bombs bring instability to Northern Ireland; until they are dealt with, whether in prison or elsewhere, stability will not come.<br><br>
I pay tribute to the people of Northern Ireland—to the businessmen, and to those who have worked for 30 years to maintain our economy in spite of terrorist violence. Our economy's resilience is remarkable. That the people of Northern Ireland have kept going, and will keep going, in the face of such adversity is testimony to their grit and determination.<br><br>
As we look to the future, we must expand into the international market by upgrading our labour and business skills. Industry is, and will continue to be, increasingly knowledge-intensive. We must invest in the future, and the Government's economic strategy must include adequate funding for training and education in Northern Ireland. However, I welcome the recent additional moneys that have ben made available in these areas.<br><br>
The number of young people who gain vocational qualifications needs to be increased. The opportunity to return to Northern Ireland must be provided for those who study in Great Britain.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0738">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 23</span>
Without such investment in the training and education of our young people, we will lose our competitive edge in the global market. The skills and expertise of the people of Northern Ireland are out greatest economic asset.</span></p>
<p>12.3 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Eddie McGrady <span class='memberconstituency'>(South Down)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: One of the Minister's most intriguing opening remarks concerned the Chancellor's initiative, which remains something of an enigma to me. Is that initiative a redistribution of the block budget, which is within the power of the present—and presumably of a future—ministerial team? Or is the Chancellor saying that, if we are fortunate enough before Easter to have inter-party agreement, there will be an economic underpinning of that agreement? Such an underpinning would enable us to catch up in those economic areas in which we have fallen behind because of our public image abroad and our internal political instability.<br><br>
To me, an initiative should be something new, something extra. The point is worthy of clarification because it will be a material factor in the weeks ahead.<br><br>
There has been a death on the Opposition benches—the death of party political economies—which I find hard to follow. My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North stated that economic development should have no boundaries or political barriers, and that there is nothing mutually exclusive between expanding trade east, west, north or south. I do not understand a mentality that seeks to impose a political restriction on economic development and job creation. Such a mentality has no logic.<br><br>
The phrase "the road to Dublin" has great political meaning in Northern Ireland. I thought that, given the number of trips he has made to Dublin in recent months, the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) would be aware of the great improvements that have been made to the road to Dublin. However, that is another story.<br><br>
The economy is a panoramic subject. I am no economist, and therefore not an expert. I have a few simple observations to make. The Northern Ireland economy is small and open. It is also fragile and is, therefore, shaken or supported by changes that occur elsewhere.<br><br>
There is an old adage—"If Britain sneezes, Northern Ireland gets a cold"—that now has global significance. There are weaknesses inherent in the economy of Northern Ireland. The sectoral base is too narrow and consists predominantly of the old manufacturing disciplines of textiles, clothing, agri-foods and related industries. There must be a greater emphasis on new technologies such as engineering—even bioengineering—in which markets of excellence can be created and be subject to further internal development and external inward investment.<br><br>
We are right to sing the praises of the quality of education in Northern Ireland's work force. However, a dichotomy exists. The Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs researched job creation in Northern Ireland and one stark fact stood out. Manufacturers and commerce
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 24</span>
constantly tell Members that they are not getting trained people with the skills that they require on the shop floor and in management. That means that technological and vocational training is insufficiently developed. That problem must be dealt with.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Roy Beggs <span class='memberconstituency'>(East Antrim)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Does the hon. Gentleman agree that representatives of industry in Northern Ireland must be prepared to sacrifice some of their time to serve on the governing bodies of schools and colleges? If they do, they can provide a direct input into training at all educational levels, even universities.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McGrady</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his valid comment. I am not especially qualified to answer him, but I know that a hands-on relationship between industry and skills training and education can be only for the good. However, I suspect that certain industries face a lack of in-house training facilities. The old regime of apprenticeships in firms seems largely to have disappeared. It has been replaced by Government training centres that are not at the coal face of training.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Member for East Antrim (Mr. Beggs: the longer we allow high unemployment to continue, the less effective will be the attention that we give to improving the quality of training of the unemployed, we are wasting one of our greatest natural assets. That is why we must concentrate on giving the unemployed greater skills, so that they will be employable either indigenously or in inward-investment ventures and projects. But we must do it now; it is too late trying to do it when something happens, because the suitably skilled work force will not be there.<br><br>
Alongside that is the present state of the core industry of farming. Although for some reason we often separate it in economic debates, it has been mentioned by every speaker this morning. I give praise to the current and past Government for their endeavours. They have made mistakes, but a great effort was made once the enormity of the calamity became apparent; and the BSE ban is now lifted, at least technically. Is a new thrust in place in any Department—be it the Department of Economic Development or the Department of Agriculture—to drive forward the recapturing of the beef markets in Europe and elsewhere, because we have not focused on that? The farming communities' terrible problem will drag on for years. I serve a rural environment, but those of us in the city perhaps do not realise how deeply economically distressed the farming community is.<br><br>
I have said—I have been accused of exaggeration, but I shall say it again—that the rural community is suffering the worst trauma since the great famine of the 1840s. It is as bad as that in every sector. We hear about the multi-million pound additional funding that is coming across in the December tranche and later tranches, but little of that is going into the revenue aspect of farming. It is going into paying back old debts for things like the Spa scheme capital development, which goes years back and is not yet paid. Is it going into new technologies? Why does it not go into the farmer's pocket on a day-to-day basis? We must deal with that.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0739">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 25</span>
As an aside, though not because it is not important, farmers in Northern Ireland in the flagged herd system are receiving nothing at all. They were promised money, but the promise was not fulfilled in the last tranche. Justice requires that somebody look at that carefully.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Thompson</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for his reference to the farming community. While we are concentrating on the cattle problem, in relation to which we see some light at the end of the tunnel, the pig, potato and sheep industries are facing many more difficulties which are all occurring at the same time. The accumulation makes matters much worse.<br><br>
I agree with the hon. Gentleman that farmers will have a very difficult time. As I understand it, an additional problem of the flagged herds is that there will be more of them now as a result of the agreement to solve the beef problem.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McGrady</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the hon. Gentleman for reaffirming what I was trying to convey to the Committee. I would add to the arduous list of difficult enterprises in farming cereals production, which has dropped 30 per cent. in the past year, an unknown and unheard of occurrence in recent years.<br><br>
The Minister touched, albeit, by necessity, briefly, on new job creation in terms of inward investment and indigenous expansion. He says that a study is under way. We must have a holistic approach to job creation. I hear the Industrial Development Board mentioned, as well as the Local Enterprise Development Unit, the Industrial Research and Technology Unit and the Training and Employment Agency. Is there harmony? Do they have one focus on job creation?<br><br>
The IDB is split off from the LEDU by a magic number of 50 employees. There is no logic in that in terms of discipline, output, values, export requirements or know-how; it is a nonsensical demarcation and must quickly be abolished. There is an upsurge of local development associations and local councils, which must be harmonised into the thrust for job creation. It is not appropriate for the training boards and research boards to be divorced from that single unitary purpose.<br><br>
Allied to that is the fact that we must include part of the Department of Agriculture because agriculture is the base industry for the agri-manufacturing industry. There is another nonsensical demarcation there—up to the farm gate is considered agriculture, but beyond the farm gate is the concern of the Department of Economic Development. That must be harmonised because it is one of our base industries.<br><br>
I hope and pray that job creation will come about in a new political and peace scenario, but there must be equality of opportunity. The Equal Opportunities Commission has just announced that equality of opportunity for jobs means that inward investment in particular and the encouragement of the expansion of indigenous industry must be grant led to the black spots that are persistent in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
I have continually said that, and it has continually been denied by Minister after Minister, but the proof of the pudding is that the Minister mentioned that recently there
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 26</span>
have been 50—I may have heard him wrong—new ventures. None of those cane to the black spot that I represent. Not one new inward-investment job has been created in South Down in the 11 years that I have been representing it. I hope that I do not get the blame for that. That is not equal opportunity in job creation.<br><br>
If the Minister has time to wind up when we have all finished speaking, he should at least take on board some of the problems that will occur in the immediate future. He should address them now because we will certainly have to face them. One problem mentioned by the hon. Member for North Antrim was the restructuring of the EU social fund, which could have a great impact in Northern Ireland if objective 1 status is withdrawn. Allied to that is the possible—although not immediate—reforms of the common agricultural and fisheries policies, which will also have a great impact in Northern Ireland. The eastward expansion of the European Union, which has not been mentioned, will, of necessity, mean that less of the cake is available to sustain development and economic growth in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
There is also the issue of EMU, about which an announcement was made yesterday. Whether one agrees with EMU is immaterial to my point—if western Europe and the Republic of Ireland are included but the UK is outside EMU, we do not know what impact that will have. I do not know how our manufacturing base will deal with that or whether it will be a good thing or a bad thing. There seems to be no dynamism to explain and prognosticate about what will happen.<br><br>
Another problem that I have already mentioned is the constraints on public expenditure. It seems rather whingeing to talk about clawbacks in public expenditure when announcements have only just been made. The hon. Member for Lagan Valley mentioned the real-terms figure of 2 per cent. The calculations that were given to me for the five years from 1996–97 to 1999–2000 show a real-terms reduction in expenditure of 1.3 per cent. If one takes out social security payments, that figure jumps to minus 2.5 per cent. That is a problem that we will face.<br><br>
Perhaps I can give a local example. There is £1.3 million for local transport, but that would build only a mile and a half of decent motorway. My constituency does not contain a motorway, so I will not be getting any of it; but that is a different ballgame. In fact, in the past 20 years—I use this only as an example and not as a parochialism—£257 million has been spent on major road works, but less than £1 million of that was spent in the Down area. That is less than one half of one per cent. in 20 years, so where is £1.3 million going to go?<br><br>
Coincidentally, I had a letter the day before yesterday from a lady who asked whether I could do something about the public transport system for the rural community of Northern Ireland. She gave me a stark but true example. She travelled from Vancouver to Belfast international airport—4,000 miles—in eight and a half hours, but she said that it took her another eight hours to get from the airport to Newcastle, which is 40 miles down the road. Fact: there is no public transport to accommodate that type of normal travel. The rural population has become more and more isolated in that respect.<br><br>
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0740">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 27</span>
I emphasise rural transport because industry, development and commerce are based on infrastructure, and the basic infrastructure is roads. Unless our roads are dramatically updated, we are setting up a barrier for ourselves against the hopeful new expansion of our economy.<br><br>
Finally, a consultative document called "Shaping our Future" was recently published in Northern Ireland. It dealt with where we are all going, in social, economic and environmental terms. The thing that surprised and shocked me was the lack of input from the Department of Economic Development, which is the basis on which social progress is made. It is also the basis on which we will be able to address our environment, in the broadest sense of the word.<br><br>
Let us not depend on peace dividends, because they are transient. At least half of the 5,000 jobs that had been created 18 months after the first peace process were in the tourist and hotel industry—low paid, temporary jobs. The other half were in retail, finances and services. None of them were basic industrial production jobs. That is what we must address, and that is why I am fearful for the future.<br><br>
I am sorry that time does not allow us to go into the detail of any of those headings, but I wanted to flag up the economic subjects that I think we should be addressing.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I ought to tell the Committee that the first speech from the Back Benches was 17 minutes and the second was 19 minutes long, so we have only 35 minutes until the wind-up.</span></p>
<p>12.24 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Rev. Paisley</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I take your hint, Mr. Jones.<br><br>
There are those who challenge, slight and attack Ulster politicians from their cosy boardrooms in Northern Ireland—we have heard the Minister speaking for them today. It should be clear to the Committee that Ulster's elected politicians have no direct responsibility for the economy, nor for any legislative matter concerning the economy. It has to be said, however, that despite all the restriction and curtailment, the Northern Ireland economy has benefited from the hard work of elected members in this House and other places. Tribute must be paid to those elected representatives who, without having any power, have used all possible influence to help Northern Ireland's economy.<br><br>
The Delors package did not come to Northern Ireland through the Government, but through the three elected Members of the European Parliament. There was great interference from the Government. The ambassador was with us and there was talk of additionality and all sorts of things, but we insisted and prevailed.<br><br>
Jacques Delors gave the people of Northern Ireland a good deal. I hope that the Government will continue to lobby with us so that the deal continues this year and in the coming year. The Dublin authorities attempted to hijack it. If there had not been unity among the three representatives from Northern Ireland, more money would have gone southward instead of to the people who needed it.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 28</span>
Many business people—their names have been mentioned today—are caught up in the current process; they tell us that it is the only way to achieve peace and economic prosperity. The same people are quick to chide politicians for doing nothing for the economy. Those very business men have been conspicuous by their silence when they should have spoken out. Their contribution to Northern Ireland's success can be measured only by the size of the largest grant that their businesses received and by the depth of their personal accounts after the Government paid them that money. Once they had their money and had had their day, they pulled up and left when it suited them.<br><br>
Those business people need to be castigated today and I said so to their faces when I recently addressed them at a meeting in Belfast. They talk about the economy, but the economy of Moira was blasted by an IRA bomb a few hours after Gerry Adams had addressed them and told them how to patch up the economy. When we get patronage from people who have had the greatest economic free rides in Northern Ireland on the back of the troubles, the Committee should realise where the truth lies.<br><br>
We must be careful that we do not wilfully throw away the advantages that Northern Ireland can offer because the struggle to be best might cost a lot more than we are willing to pay. Everyone has to pay a price to get our economy right and to get the stability that we need. In an effort to sustain a process in which they have invested so much time, the Government have fed others the line that all will be lost if there is no agreement. I do not believe that. May will come, and the Northern Ireland economy will still be with us, no matter what happens at the talks. I do not have the time to deal with the talks today, but we in Northern Ireland have to realise that attempts have been made, and have failed, to end Republican violence and Republican murders, which are still going on—talks or no talks. We have to face up to that.<br><br>
As a region, we should look to Europe because we are on its doorstep. We are in Europe. I do not often read the Irish papers, but I could not get a <i>News Letter</i> this morning so I picked an Irish paper up. I noticed that Europe has given a warning that the economy of the south of Ireland will be in great jeopardy. It will have the greatest inflation of all the countries in Europe at the end of the year. Some £6 million will be withdrawn and it will be pocketed by the Irish Republic every day. When that money has gone, what will happen to the economy? Yet there are those who tell us that we should tie ourselves to that economy.<br><br>
The Minister talked about some assembly making decisions, but he did not tell us that, spanning that assembly, there will be a joint north-south body which will have executive powers over all these Departments. What say will the people of Northern Ireland have in decision making then? It is bad enough trying to be heard in Westminster and Europe, but this will be a cosy non-attended meeting; anybody who is outside the particular remit can sit on these committees, make decisions and have executive power to put into operation matters concerning the economy.<br><br>

I was really surprised today that the main part of Ulster's economy was not dealt with because the relevant Minister is not here to deal with it. The most important section of our economy is agriculture. If we do not get agriculture right, our economy goes down the drain. There are two things that need to be dealt with regarding agriculture. We must face up to the matter that has been referred to by the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady). We need a strategy, because if we get the okay—and I hope that the veterinary men will not do what some of them say they will—we will have to go into Europe with no market and fight for every bit of beef that we are going to sell. We will have to try and get a market. Even so, that market is now much reduced because the propaganda put out by the various members of the European Union means that people in Europe are not eating as much meat as they used to. In some countries, 40 per cent. of the market has disappeared even for their own meat. So we will have great difficulty.<br><br>
Secondly, there is an agenda 2000 proposal from Europe which will be drastic for the common agricultural policy and the whole structure of agriculture. I know that there is time for the Government to make known what they will do about the proposal. We must not, however, drag our feet. If the Council's proposals come to fruition it will be to the detriment of our largest single industry. Change is therefore imperative. I should like the Government to spell out which sections of agriculture they will fight for and how they believe the disbursement of agriculture funds should be made in the future.<br><br>
National Governments are moving increasingly towards intervention. There are national Governments who will feed money into agriculture, and if the same amount of money is not fed into Northern Ireland agriculture, the playing field will not be level and we will be at a serious disadvantage. I am unhappy about the compensation package; it is even steeper than originally proposed. The Commission is proposing a 13 per cent. cut in butter and skimmed milk interventions, a 30 per cent. cut in beef and a 20 per cent. cut in cereals. It is proposing compensation through direct income payments only at rates of 50 per cent. of the price of cereals, 80 per cent. for beef and 70 per cent. for dairy farmers. Yet our farmer's income has gone down by 60 per cent. during the current crisis.<br><br>
You are looking at me in a terrible way, Mr. Jones, and I have been long enough in the House to know what that means. I do not want you to have a heart attack because of my proceeding further. However, let me just say to the Minister that I know he cannot answer some of my questions; we need to talk to his ministerial colleague about the agriculture situation.<br><br>
Finally, we need a full-time Minister who can go to Europe and negotiate for Northern Ireland. Wales and Scotland will have direct representation in Europe as a result of devolution, but Northern Ireland will not. We need a full-time Minister who can plead the people's cause in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Short speeches are appreciated. I should inform the Committee that under Standing Order No. 88, the debate on the Northern Ireland economy can be extended until 1.15 pm. The half-hour Adjournment debate will follow in the usual way.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 30</span>
<p>12.36 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McNamara</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I shall not detain the Committee for long, but I want to discuss various matters.<br><br>
I was pleased to hear the comments of the hon. Member for North Antrim (Rev. Ian Paisley) about the outcome of the talks process; his words give me great encouragement.<br><br>
I was disappointed by the speech of the hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson). He seemed to disparage the work that the Northern Ireland CBI did with IBEC. That is particularly sad because it goes against the advice and wisdom of business men north and south of the border on the island of Ireland. They know that there is a natural market between the north and the south, and that the north and the south have to co-operate if they are to benefit from the advantages of the single market and to avoid the threats that that market poses to peripheral island economies.<br><br>
Those business men pay particular attention to the north European trade access programme, which the hon. Gentleman praised, although it would alter the situation in the island of Ireland. IBEC-CBI has passed resolutions about NETA, and it said of that programme in a letter to me:
<br><blockquote><p>"Any east-west trade development activity will encompass all of the island of Ireland, and not be restricted to the twelve northern counties on either side of the border."</p></blockquote>
That is important because it involves more than would be the case under the Delors programme, which the hon. Member for North Antrim complimented and congratulated Mr. Delors on. The letter also states that the business development programme will investigate.
<br><blockquote><p>"the possibility of setting up links with the two overseas trade development agencies on the island of Ireland for organising future trade missions that may come under the banner of NETA activities."</p></blockquote>
That is of the utmost importance for the north of Ireland and for the Republic of Ireland. If those links were established, the Delors plan would not be possible—the Republic considered that plan and quickly got rid of it.<br><br>
The programme that is outlined in the brochure, "Working Together for a Better Business Future", which was put forward by business men both north and south of the border, is positive. It is particularly significant that the main protagonist is not some green nationalist but a former senior civil servant in Northern Ireland and chairman of the Ulster bank, Sir George Quigley. He could by no means be described as a covert nationalist.<br><br>
The Belfast-Dublin trade corridor is being developed, and many of its advantages are being realised. My hon. Friend the Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume) is somewhat upset about that because he believes that it should be a Derry-Galway-Limerick-Tralee corridor. He tends to be a little parochial on occasion, although I understand his constituency interest in the matter. I, too, must declare a constituency interest: the trans-European road runs through the port of Hull and a considerable number of exports from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland go through Hull. I make a special plea to my hon. Friend the Minister to put pressure on my right hon. Friend at the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to ensure that when the roads programme is announced in May it will include development of the Heddon road to improve access to the port and open up

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 31</span>
areas for development of industry, which can only be for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland who trade through the port of Hull.<br><br>
The programmes put forward by IBEC and the CBI are to be commended, particularly because they follow a trail that was blazed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which many years ago made a strong case for treating the island of Ireland as one economy. In the best spirit of new Labour and praise for the work of employers and the CBI, I commend them for listening to the representatives of the organised working class in Ireland and making positive contributions in complete contrast to the negative attitudes from some of those who represent constituencies in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p>12.42 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Robert McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: A great variety of topics has been covered, so I shall confine my comments to the contribution of the hon. Member for Hull, North.<br><br>
There is no economic substance in Sir George Quigley's pipe dream of a Northern Ireland economy. Indeed, so devoid of any economic basis is the idea that the economies of Northern Ireland and the Republic are complementary that during the great debate of 1984 on the new Ireland forum, Sir Charles Carter, a leading economist in the United Kingdom, dismissed that as being on a par with Yeats' "Isle of Innisfree" in which he said:
<br><blockquote><p>"Nine bean rows will I have there, a hive for the honey bee".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McNamara</span><span class='membercontribution'>: It continues:
<br><blockquote><p>"And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow".</p></blockquote></span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McCartney</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That may be so, but I am talking about economics rather than something more ethereal.<br><br>
The deficits in the concept of an all-Ireland economy are long standing. One traditional Ulster Unionist during the home rule debate dismissed the same argument when he asked who would exchange the markets of an empire for those of the bog of Allen. Not a great deal has changed in the meantime as far as Northern Ireland and the Republic are concerned. Exports from Northern Ireland to the Republic are about 6 per cent.; exports to the remainder of the United Kingdom are more than 50 per cent. External sales to the Republic represent between 8 and 9 per cent. of the total. Those figures can be authenticated from many sources.<br><br>
Sir George Quigley put forward the idea in conjunction with IBEC in 1992 that with an all-Ireland economy the north-south, Dublin-Belfast corridor would produce 75,000 new jobs. It is now accepted that was an horrendous exaggeration and the true figure probably does not exceed one tenth of that. I have not been able to find one reputable economist—I have researched the matter carefully in recent weeks—who can put a cogent argument supporting an all-Ireland economy. Where does the suggestion come from? It comes from the politically driven peace process and the idea that the framework document would provide a functionally and factually united Ireland if taken to the logical extent. The idea that
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 32</span>
cross-border political institutions are necessary to energise economic links is without foundation. Most economists suggest that if any benefit can be derived from all-Ireland trade links, those links can be more easily, effectively and less politically harmfully achieved as a result of market-driven forces. They should not be achieved by an additional overlay of bureaucracy, which would result in the very things that industrialists and entrepreneurs do not want—delaying of decisions, blocking of trade and hamming it up with red tape. Can one imagine what such a layer of bureaucracy would do to trade?<br><br>
As for some of the Minister's comments about the setting up of a new body to provide equality of opportunity—which would include the Fair Employment Commission, Equal Opportunities and the Racial Equality Board—they were based on the false premise that indigenous discrimination in the workplace continues in Northern Ireland. The chairman of the Fair Employment Commission, Robert Cooper, has stated on many occasions that the effect of religious or political discrimination on the disparity between Catholic and Protestant or Nationalist and Unionist employment is absolutely minimal.<br><br>
No one wants to address the real problem regarding unemployment in Northern Ireland—the birth rate. It currently runs at 14.5 per 1,000 which is higher than the birth rate in the Republic and almost one and a half times higher than the average European Union birth rate.<br><br>
To wind up, I wish to highlight the problem in Derry. Unlike the constituency of the hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady), Derry with the assistance of its representatives, has been the focus of much inward investment probably more than any other part of the United Kingdom—and new job creation. To maintain Derry's present level of employment, 3,000 new jobs are required annually, as that represents the disparity between those leaving employment and new school leavers entering it.<br><br>
We must address the real issues and stop codding about with political panaceas that do not match the facts. We must look at the real economic questions, and stop superimposing economic and utilitarian motives on what is really a political agenda.</span></p>
<p>12.48 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Lembit Öpik <span class='memberconstituency'>(Montgomeryshire)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: Let us not forget that even without the specific political situation of Northern Ireland, its geographical and economic circumstances make it worthy of specific support from the UK Government. I shall outline my reasons for saying that, and quickly review the implications of the Budget and some other issues arising from today's discussion.<br><br>
Northern Ireland's problem stems largely from its rural nature, its remoteness and its historically low wage rates. The present Government—and previous Governments—have let the UK's rural economies down. The issue of BSE has already been debated today, but I shall stress once again its crippling effect on those parts of the country where livestock and especially beef production have been important. Perhaps even more seriously, the strength of the pound—as we have already heard today—is having a disastrous effect, not just on agriculture but
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0743">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 33</span>
on livestock exporters and other farming produce exporters who were in many cases trying to supplement their income in the wake of the collapse of the beef industry. Farmers' cash flow and credit are what keeps them afloat, and I am surprised that a much deeper recession has not occurred in Northern Ireland's rural communities. If the precedent of mid Wales applies in Northern Ireland, it saddens me to say that such a recession will follow.<br><br>
Two specific circumstances relating to the Northern Ireland economy are worth mentioning. The hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson) has already made the point that Northern Ireland's economy is especially dependent on Government spending. Its GDP per head is 82 per cent. of the figure for the UK as a whole but if we take away Government spending, its GDP per head is about 64 per cent. of the UK average. That makes Northern Ireland's economy more stable but also makes it dependent on what it gets from across the water.<br><br>
European funding has been vital. The peace and reconciliation fund is due to expire in about 18 months—five years after the two ceasefires, the first in autumn 1994. Northern Ireland stands to lose millions when that ends.<br><br>
I have a few observations to make about where we go from here. The hon. Member for Lagan Valley and the hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney) mentioned north-south and east-west economic links. They rightly pointed out that the north-south economy provides about one twentieth of the economic opportunity offered by east-west relations.<br><br>
The hon. and learned Member for North Down said between 6 and 9 per cent. of Northern Ireland's total output goes to the Republic of Ireland. That is slightly more than one might expect, given the size of the Republic's economy. However, if only half of Northern Ireland's output goes to Great Britain, it can be argued that Northern Ireland is underperforming with regard to its mainland neighbour.<br><br>
It is dangerous to try to bring in political assessments to simple economic facts. It is vital to build infrastructure between Northern Ireland and its large trading partners, including Great Britain. That does not militate against the maintenance of Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland links. No one seeks to prevent that development and there is a good economic case for going where the big markets are.<br><br>
I do not think that the Budget was particularly helpful to Northern Ireland. I have mentioned the strength of the pound; it is lamentable that our economic policy has one arm tied behind its back and that the Chancellor cannot use taxation to control economic performance instead of relying on interest rates alone. Interest rates are crippling our export industries.<br><br>
The Government have taken on about a third of the Liberal Democrats' policy on fuel costs. They have not reduced road tax, as it is commonly known, to between £10 and £20 and rural communities will suffer from that. It will have a negative effect on areas in which public transport does not exist.<br><br>
The Government's contribution to rural transport is absolutely pathetic. It works out at 60p per day per square mile or, more graphically, less than a penny for every
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 34</span>
four days for every citizen of Northern Ireland. We cannot rebuild public transport in Northern Ireland with that kind of miserly contribution. I agree with the strategy but we cannot pretend that the Government's contribution is generous. I hope for a manifold increase if the Government are serious about rebuilding the rural infrastructure.<br><br>
Unemployment is doing quite well despite a small increase in Northern Ireland. However, we need to apply pressure on the Government to change the way in which unemployment is measured. Real unemployment is about double the official figure. For 18 years, the Labour party complained about how the Conservatives measured unemployment, but now that they are in government, they are unwilling to change the measure. We must ensure that Northern Ireland makes the strongest possible case for continued European funding, and the unemployment figure will have an unreasonably high impact on our chances of getting funding for Northern Ireland and for Wales and other rural areas. I appeal to the Minister to pass on the message that a reassessment of how unemployment is measured would help Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Liberal Democrats have always supported the idea of a single currency. Whether the Republic of Ireland has the single currency or its own will not make much difference, as an exchange rate will be involved in either case. Perhaps the face on the coins will change, and the euro will show Mr. Mitterrand or some other great European figure such as Martin Luther. The important point is that if we both enter the European single currency, it may marginally benefit the situation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.<br><br>
Finally, I want to talk about the peace dividend and consider where to go from here. It is so important that we do not overestimate the impact of a peace settlement in May on the economic performance of Northern Ireland. A settlement will probably have an impact on tourism, but it will not dramatically change the gross domestic product, except in the very long term. So it would be foolish and dangerous for the Government to think that they could save money from public investment simply by Northern Ireland finding a new accord. If a peaceful settlement is achieved, I counsel Ministers not to act quickly or rashly in seeking to make savings.<br><br>
The best thing to do is to build links with business. Our earlier debate emphasised the importance of finding ways to listen to business in Northern Ireland. The people who run business there speak for the workers and for trade, which depends on the current political situation and on the future Northern Ireland that we are trying to create. The best thing the Minister can do is to listen to business people in Northern Ireland. That will enable Northern Ireland to be a big player, with direct European links, and to market its economic opportunities to potential international investors. Perhaps most importantly, we should recognise that whatever political solution is reached, Northern Ireland will always be in a difficult situation due to its geography and historically low gross domestic product. The more we can do to help Northern Ireland to catch up with both of its neighbours, the sooner Northern Ireland will come close to the levels of prosperity that we see elsewhere in the British Isles.</span></p>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 35</span>
<p>12.58 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Although you have extended the sitting until 1.15 pm, Mr. Jones, I do not intend to speak for that long because my opening remarks were lengthy.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson), who is not in his seat at the moment—he told me that he had to leave the Room on urgent business—made a significant contribution to the debate. He welcomed what he described, and I have previously described, as a growth in the Northern Ireland economy, although he emphasised the difficulties that we currently face and could face in future. He rightly drew attention to the fact and could face in future. He rightly drew attention to the fact that we need a high skill base in Northern Ireland if we are to survive in the years ahead. I commented on that in my opening remarks.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman made specific mention of Bombardier Shorts. I have met the senior executives of Bombardier and have met with senior management at Shorts on several occasions specifically to talk about the points that were raised. Bombardier is just the sort of company that is needed in Northern Ireland because of its high skill base, especially within its design sector. I have intimated to those who have made representations to me about any possible threat to that company that I and my officials will keep closely in touch with the company and consider how to deal with any questions that arise about the company's plans for the future. It is important for that company to try to retain an integrated design and manufacturing facility in Northern Ireland.<br><br>
Comment was made on the future of the beef industry. Support given to small businesses by the Local Enterprise Development Unit and the IDB will continue to uphold export strategies as they are developed and identified. The sector is important. I think that the hon. Member for North Antrim said that I had not mentioned the issue, but I highlighted the importance of the sector in terms of the whole food chain—</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>The Chairman</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Order. Under Standing Order No. 88, I defer interrupting proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thought that you were calling me to order, Mr. Jones.<br><br>
The agrifood business is important. The Government are aware that the 60,000 jobs which I mentioned are key to many of the rural communities referred to by hon. Members. The same is true of road infrastructure and other issues relevant to the Northern Ireland economy, but we cannot solve all the problems overnight. When hon. Members raise specific issues and say that more money should be spent, they must think about where that is to come from. There is not a bottomless pit. It is not a case of a constant flow of support going into the Northern Ireland economy or, indeed, any other regional economy in the UK. When hon. Members ask for more, where do they want less? Ministers have to ask that question and hon. Members will have to consider it if they get their hands on local economic determination. It is worth asking the question now: if hon. Members want more money for roads, where should it not be spent—on education or health? Ministers have to deal with those issues.</span></p>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 36</span>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Öpik</span><span class='membercontribution'>: At the risk of sounding antagonistic, will not the Minister accept that many of us would like the Government to spend rather less on the election war chest for four year's hence?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I hesitate to enter into that debate. The hon. Gentleman's party would clearly like to have an election war chest, and I suggest that it begin to build for the future. The Government do not build their strategy on that basis—it is a matter for political parties. The Government are seeking to implement long-term strategies for the benefit of the whole UK economy.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Is not one of the problems that the private sector does not know to what extent the public sector will hold its ground or develop its spending over a reasonable period? Private sector investment is there to be had in many areas of the economy if the Government signal that they will not use increased private sector investment as an excuse to lower public sector investment.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: The evidence from strong economies is that they are strong because of increased private sector investment and growth. They are not just based on cash injections or the handout approach that may have prevailed in the past. We need to stimulate more private sector investment, and partnerships can be built between private and public interest. That is what the private finance initiative is about. It does, of course, have implications, but none the less it is a way of trying to deal with the immediate large-scale problems, such as infrastructure expenditure on roads, education and health, which face Governments and local economies. There is a way of building that relationship.<br><br>
I do not recognise the description given by the hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Magginis)—that the private sector is not aware of what the government are trying to do. We are closely engaged with the private sector in talks about the future. We set planning horizons in the normal parameters of government. There is a good argument for having longer planning horizons. The Government are trying to address the issue of long-term strategies. The matter rests not with me, but with the Chancellor.<br><br>
Because of the short-time available, I shall not take any more interventions. I did not fully grasp what the hon. Member for Lagan Valley said, but I think his point was that we would not be able to develop a close economic relationship with the Republic of Ireland because of its membership of the economic and monetary union. If that was his argument—he is not present to confirm it—it would apply equally to the UK's relationship with Germany, France, Italy and the other countries that have signed up to the single currency. That would be nonsensical. Close economic and working relationships can exist whether or not one has the same currency or trading arrangements. I do not think that industry in Northern Ireland would welcome the hon. Gentleman's argument; he is effectively saying that we should end our relationship with the Republic because of a difference in currency—a difference that already exists.<br><br>
The hon. Member for South Down (Mr. McGrady) asked for clarification of the Chancellor's initiative. I
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0745">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 37</span>
suggest that he refer to what I said earlier about its parameters. The hon. Gentleman implied that the Chancellor's initiative could work only by cash injection, but I do not believe that that is the only or the best way of delivering it. The Chancellor has other mechanisms open to him, such as forgoing taxation or introducing different fiscal arrangements, which are not cash injections but which could have a profound effect on companies that want to invest in the longer term.<br><br>
The hon. Members for South Down and for Lagan Valley raised the issues of unemployment, education and so on. The new deal gives £140 million to training and the Budget £6 million to education. We are building a new university for industry and are involved, as I announced, in the learning age scheme which will examine lifelong training and retraining; it involves the whole UK economy, but has importance for Northern Ireland. The hon. Member for South Down said that no investment comes into his constituency, but unemployment in his constituency has fallen by 12 per cent. in the past year. I say to all hon. Members who want more investment in their constituencies that one can encourage potential or existing inward investors to go to a particular location, but if they do not wish to, we accept that. We do not say, "If you will not go to South Down, we do not want you."</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. McGrady</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the Minister give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: No, I said that I shall not take any more interventions.<br><br>
We have a package of incentives for bringing industry into Northern Ireland and for encouraging indigenous growth that is as good if not better than that for anywhere else in the UK. Northern Ireland has many attractive features for industry, but it is difficult to bring in inward investment, as I know from my recent visits to the States, Japan and Taiwan. Investors are concerned by the troubles; we cannot hide from that. It is difficult to get over our selling message, but we have strong qualities. Client executives in foreign countries do a tremendous job in encouraging companies into Norther Ireland. As part of the overall appraisal of economic strategy, we must examine our performance in those countries and look towards new markets, perhaps in Europe. As has been said, Northern Ireland should look towards Europe as well as the smaller economy of the Republic of Ireland.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) also asked me to draw to the attention of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions the important issue of the port of Hull. I shall of course ensure that his representations are transmitted to my hon. Friends, although I am sure that he is doing so on his own behalf. His point was valid. We must continually check where Northern Ireland goods are exported from if they go on to another market, and whether there is a relationship between what we are doing in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. There could well be a synergy of interests that could be built on to the benefit of us all. The representations that the hon. Gentleman made on behalf of his constituency can have an impact in that way.<br><br>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 38</span>
The hon. and learned Member for North Down (Mr. McCartney) raised the issue of the north-south equation and exports. The Republic of Ireland is out with the United Kingdom and is therefore categorised as an export market. That is why I gave the figure of 25 per cent. of exports from Northern Ireland going to the Republic of Ireland; that does not conflict with the point that the hon. and learned Gentleman was making about total production and its destination. The Republic of Ireland is a significant export market which is worth about £170 million and we should not discount it.<br><br>
Leaving aside the argument about the Northern Ireland economy, the north-south equation is important. Much trading goes on between north and south and there is an interest to be developed. If we can improve links to enhance that trading, I am sure that all right hon. and hon. Members would support that.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) launched an amazing attach on the Government for doing nothing for the rural economy. We have been in government for 10 months and we have already announced initiatives for the rural economy. His solution as I understand it is to spend more money on rural development, infrastructure and probably other items that he did not have time to enumerate. He said that we should pay for that through taxation. That is why he represents a small party and why the Labour party is not only the largest party, but is in government.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Beggs</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I thank the Minister for giving way. I am sure that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Mr. Öpik) would like to join me and others in welcoming the announcement by the Minister with responsibility for the environment in Northern Ireland that we are to have an interconnection with Scotland. I pay tribute to the good work that was done by the three Members of the European Parliament in helping to achieve that funding, from which the whole Province will benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is an important point, to which I alluded in my earlier comments. The interconnector will bring benefits to the Northern Ireland energy market and to the overall economy. A contribution of £72 million is coming from Europe, which is project-specific—if we do not have the interconnection, the money will not be allocated elsewhere within the Northern Ireland economy but will go back to Europe.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire asked for a recalculation of the unemployment figures. That is what the Government are doing. We are reviewing the whole method of calculating unemployment, a process that is due to come into place in April this year. The hon. Gentleman also said that the peace dividend should not be used as an excuse for taking money away from the overall block. I said earlier that there is no peace dividend; there are major peace costs. As we begin to consider the costs and implications of peace, the cash register is ringing up hundreds of millions of pounds, depending on which scenario we look at. The money has to be found from somewhere. My ministerial colleagues and I are trying to ensure that we get it not only from the UK Exchequer but perhaps from Europe and the United States. It will underpin a peaceful future for Northern Ireland, which we all want.<br><br>

<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 39</span>
The hon. Gentleman also asked me to listen to business people. I do. I also listen to trade unions and to the wider community. There comes a point, however, when listening must stop and action must start. I hope to get to that point at an early stage. With the co-operation of the hon. Gentlemen who represent the political parties in Northern Ireland, I hope that we can move forward together on that basis.</span></p>
<p><i>Question put and agreed to.</i></p>
<p><i>Resolved,</i>
<br><blockquote><p>That the Committee has considered the matter of the Northern Ireland Economy.</p></blockquote></p>

Talks Process</div> <!-- title -->
<p>Motion made, and Question proposed, That the Committee do now adjourn.—[<i>Mr. Dowd.</i>]</p>
<p>1.15 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ken Maginnis <span class='memberconstituency'>(Fermanagh and South Tyrone)</span></span><span class='membercontribution'>: I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Northern Ireland peace talks and, in particular, to relate my remarks, although not exclusively, to the parallel-track approach.<br><br>
As hon. Members will be aware, there has been a great deal of spin-doctoring about the prospects of agreement emanating from the talks, which have now been going on for almost two years. I do not want to sound pessimistic, but it would be wrong not to bring an element of reality to bear on the question of where the peace talks are taking us.<br><br>
It is important that I point out that my party's participation in the peace talks occurred because of a hard-won understanding with the previous Government that matters would progress first and foremost on the basis that there would be a set of principles to which all participating parties would pledge allegiance. Those are referred to as the Mitchell principles and they were compiled by the international commission made up of Senator George Mitchell, General John de Chastelain and the former premier of Finland, Ham Holkeri.<br><br>
In the difficult situation in which we found ourselves in Northern Ireland, we, as democratic politicians and members of the largest party, had a responsibility to try to reach political accommodation with those who did not agree with us in terms of constitutional aspirations. But we hoped that there was common ground on day-to-day matters.<br><br>
We had to contend with the underlying violence that has pervaded our society for the past 28 years. That violence does not come exclusively from one tradition, but is found across the community and has over the years driven the two communities further and further apart geographically, in so far as there are ghetto areas, and also in terms of the level of trust that exists between the two traditions. How can we look at someone from one tradition or the other and say that that person is a terrorist? All we see is someone who is part of a tradition from which may emerge terrorists who will attack our tradition.<br><br>
That was the basis on which we went to the table of democracy. We wended our way through a laborious year until the election and the arrival into power of new Labour. On many occasions, we had been told by other Unionist parties that we should have expedited the arrival of the Labour party because it would be assiduous in creating open government and in dealing with us while we tackled our problems. Sadly, that has turned out not to be the case.<br><br>
We find ourselves a little like a shopper who believes that he has bought goods at a reputable store, but finds that he has been delivered products from a market stall that is manipulated by fairly shady characters. I am not saying that those shady characters are in the Government. They are the people whom the Government have brought to the table of democracy and who represent paramilitary organisations. Some of them have come to the table in
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0747">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 41</span>
good faith and, despite their entwinement with paramilitary organisations, have shown that they want to move themselves and society forward. They are embryo democrats. That does not apply exclusively to any single group.<br><br>
There are, however, people who see the opportunity of shaping and moulding democracy to suit their plan. We foresaw that difficulty and therefore arranged with the Government for there to be a parallel track approach. In that way, we could deal with purely political issues separately from military or terrorist issues—some people speak of military or paramilitary issues, but I see them as purely terrorist activities. The two aspects were, however, to proceed in parallel so that we could have a peaceful society at the end of the process. After 28 years of violence, there could be an agreement that had a chance of success. We did not want cross-ties between the two tracks because that would have necessitated trading political concessions for guns and bombs. That is not the basis on which democracy should function. The two tracks were entirely separate, but moved in parallel.<br><br>
The difficulty began with the previous Government. There was no doubt about that in our mind. In September 1996, we implored the Governments to move forward and to put in place all the procedures that could lead to disarmament. They conspired and contrived to slow down the entire process. It was not until the present Government came to power that we began to see some movement. A series of events occurred, but they were much too late to ensure that the tracks moved in parallel.<br><br>
None the less, things began to happen. It would be wrong for me not to acknowledge the fact that legislation has been introduced to facilitate disarmament of terrorist weapons and explosives and that a commission has been set up. Those things have happened. We hoped that the temperature and the attitude would be right and that we could capitalise on those successes and move with some speed. We have been disappointed and again find the two Governments contriving to avoid the issue.<br><br>
It is appropriate at this stage to draw attention to a question that I posed about a week ago to the Secretary of State. I asked her:
<br><blockquote><p>"if she intends to agree to a political settlement involving those parties with paramilitary links without those parties and the paramilitary organisations with which they are linked being committed to the Mitchell Principles and demonstrate progress being made along the parallel track which deals with disarmament."</p></blockquote>
One would have thought that that was a fairly basic and simple question for the Secretary of State to answer. To put it in even simpler terms, it was asking, "Are the Government prepared to countenance any form of agreement that incorporates people with terrorist links in a future Executive or Administration?"<br><br>
Let us thinks what that would mean. I shall refer at more length later to Gerry Kelly, but if he were Minister of Health, he would be running an organisation that treated people brought in for gunshot wounds at the same time as he was ordering terrorists to go and shoot more people. That is the reality of incorporating terrorists with no commitment to peace and democracy in a democratic process.<br><br>
In case anybody thinks that I exaggerate the situation, I draw attention to the words of one of the negotiators in the talks, Francis Molloy, a district councillor in my home
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 42</span>
town. He stated to a fairly large meeting of extreme republicans, as well as journalists from the <i>Irish News</i> and a journalist from an English newspaper, that if the IRA did not get what it wanted—if there was no agreement on its terms—it would go back to doing what it does best. We all know what that is.<br><br>
We have not heard a word of repudiation from Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness or anyone else. Instead we are told by the Government that the leadership—note the word carefully—of the IRA is not ordering the violence that is occurring through bombs in Portadown and Moira, mortar attacks in Armagh and Forkhill, murders in Dunmurray and so on. The leadership is not ordering these attempts, by implication. We must endure the leadership of that organisation at the table of democracy. But that is a gross deceit, for the simple reason that the leadership of the IRA has never, in 28 years, ordered its activists to go out and commit individual acts of aggression.<br><br>
There is a fundamental obligation on terrorist organisations to carry out what they call the war—the armed struggle—and to carry it on at what they call brigade level.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I will in a moment. Let me finish this point.<br><br>
The brigade commanders have the obligation to do that, without any direction from the leadership. Again the leadership is not defined by the Government, but I assume that they mean Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness, Martin Ferris, Gerry Kelly and people like that, who sit at the table of democracy, and of course Slab Murphy, who has yet to appear, but I would not be surprised if he turned up one day.<br><br>
The only direct order the leadership will give under the present arrangement is that violence should cease, and that individual acts of violence should not take place. They could give that order. That is the only role that the leadership has on a day-to-day basis as far as terrorism is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I intervene only because I do not know whether there will be an opportunity to reply in detail to the hon. Gentleman's points. He said that there is a web of deceit regarding the relationship between the Provision IRA's leadership and recent incidents, and accused the Secretary of State, and others, of being party to that web of deceit. I understand that the hon. Gentleman recently met the Chief Constable. Is he saying that the Chief Constable is involved in that web of deceit as well? Will he confirm that the Chief Constable said exactly what the Secretary of State has been saying over recent weeks and months regarding recent incidents?</span></p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Maginnis</span><span class='membercontribution'>: That is a clever question, but I have thought about it. The Chief Constable has responsibility for law and order, for apprehending terrorists and bringing them through the court system. Therefore, there are certain constraints upon him, while there are no constraints upon the Minister or the Secretary of State or people like me. Our experience is as great as that of the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0748">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 43</span>
Chief Constable's, even if our intimate knowledge is not as great. The Chief Constable has made matters very clear regarding the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, and the Continuity Army Council, which is sometimes referred to as the CAC. "CAC", by the way, is the Irish word for something that we would not like to step in accidentally. I thought that the analogy would be of interest. As I was saying,t he 32 County Sovereignty Committee, the Continuity Army Council and the Provisional IRA meet on a regular basis to co-ordinate matters.<br><br>
I promised that I would mention Mr. Kelly again. He has been to see Mr. McKevitt and his adherents to discover the basis on which the activities orchestrated and carried out by that triumvirate are taking place. He has not told them that they must cease their violence. The Minister cannot give an example of a single instance of those people whom his Government brought to the table of democracy campaigning, as they are obliged to do under the Mitchell principles, for people to renounce and desist form violence. One of the Mitchell principles says that the people at the table have to
<br><blockquote><p>"renounce for themselves, and to oppose any effort by others,"</p></blockquote>
to use force. What opposition has the Minister seen from these people, who have said that they will go back to doing what they do best?<br><br>
In the fifth principle, there is an obligation on people at the table of democracy to
<br><blockquote><p>"agree to abide by the terms of any agreement".</p></blockquote>
Yet the Minister knows that the Provisional IRA, whose representatives sit at the table, have said that if an assembly is agreed upon, giving the people of Northern Ireland the right to have a say in their future and the administration of their region, the Provisional IRA will not enter that assembly. Yet they expect us to form an operational and executive alliance with the Irish Republic in a final agreement, which would mean handing over the responsibilities that we, collectively in Northern Ireland, should shoulder on behalf of society. Therein lies the difficulty that we face. All those expectations are presented to Unionists. We are now the only traditional Unionist party in the talks process. We are the largest party in Northern Ireland. No agreement can come about unless it is with our agreement. We are expected to participate as though everything were above board, and as though the parallel track were being constructed, but yesterday the Secretary of State and the Minister could not say that that was the case. What is the alternative to our accepting what the Government unreasonably expect? It is that we be administered in future by a series of commissions and quangos.<br><br>
We sat in this Room in Committee for over 48 hours, discussing the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill. However, in those almost 50 hours we did not hear the phrase Mediation Network mentioned. I have never heard a word about Mediation Network from the Government. Mediation Network is a body established by the Northern Ireland Office. It is so "independent" and "voluntary" that it is funded to the tune of almost £200,000 by the Northern Ireland Office to carry out studies about the future of policing and to encourage police officers to visit
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 44</span>
other areas. Well dare the Chief Constable dissent from a suggestion that he go to Brooklyn, or somewhere else in New York, to examine two-tier policing. I have so little time that I must leave that issue in mid-air; I hope that the Committee understands my point.<br><br>
I was implored—quite reasonably—by the hon. Member for Putney (Mr. Colman), who has just left the Room, to read again a document called "Restorative Justice and Partnership Against Crime". My party has never been consulted on the matter. That piece of paper tells us about something that sounds quite attractive, until one reads an article by Ed Moloney in <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i> Ed Moloney is not a Unionist like me. He is from a different tradition, writing for a paper in the Irish Republic. He suggests that that document is a means whereby paramilitaries may take part in law enforcement. I read it again at the behest of the hon. Member for Putney and discovered that that is exactly what it is. It is not a rejection of the scheme that is in place in Thames Valley, which is run by the police. This scheme will be run by community groups. We know what those groups would be and who would control them, in the Falls road, the Shankhill road, the Bogside and South Armagh. In the very short time that has been available to me, that is what I wanted to demonstrate. I hope that I shall have more time between now and the end of this Session of Parliament to continue to do that.<br><br>
We are faced with deceit and behind-backs dealings. Whether an agreement is accepted or not, an international commission will ultimately be imposed to introduce a form of self-regulatory policing in Northern Ireland. We have seen the effect of what the Minister admits is self-regulation on the prison system, and the same thing will happen to policing, criminal justice and the way in which we deal with prisoners.<br><br>
I shall now finish my speech as I want the Minister to have the opportunity to reply to the points that I have made.</span></p>
<p>1.41 pm</p>
<p><span class='member'>Mr. Ingram</span><span class='membercontribution'>: I had intended to make a detailed reply to the hon. Gentleman but, with respect, I do not think that he has even attempted to deal with the subject matter of the debate. He has rambled over a wide range of issues, and I now have three minutes—by my calculation—to reply. The normal practice in Adjournment debates is to allow roughly 15 minutes for a Member to propose an argument, and 15 minutes for the Minister to reply. I regret that there has not been an opportunity to deal with some of the key issues raised by hon. Members.<br><br>
The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (Mr. Maginnis) has failed to take advantage of an important platform for putting questions to the Government and obtaining replies. Many of the issues that he raised—and the scenarios that he painted—would perhaps be better dealt with in the other forum considering a better way forward for Northern Ireland. I see that the hon. Member for East Londonderry (Mr. Ross) is indicating from a sedentary position that he is not happy, and I will address his concerns. However, detailed discussions are taking place within the talks process, which provides the best opportunity to consider the way forward. I am not saying that the House does not have the
<span class="label imageref" rel="tooltip" title="Image source: SC1997-1998V006P0I0749">Image</span>
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 45</span>
right to scrutinise the Government or Ministers, which is why I regret that I do not have time to fully address some of the issues raised by hon. Members.<br><br>
The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of political parties that are—to use his terminology—entwined with paramilitary groups. It should be placed on record—and should always be borne in mind—that two of those parties—the Ulster Democratic party and Sinn Fein—were removed from the talks because of a breach of the Mitchell principles under the procedures signed up to by the hon. Gentleman's party. Those two parties have been re-admitted to the talks process because they have signed up again to the Mitchell principles, which is in accordance with the procedures signed up to by the hon. Gentleman's party.<br><br>
In his opening comments, the hon. Gentleman said that he thought that we had entered the era of open government. He then said that that was not the case, and that much activity was taking place—I will not use the words that he used—to obscure what was happening. He
<span class='label label-info column' rel='tooltip' title='Column number'>Col. 46</span>
held up a consultative document about restorative justice systems. The publication of that document on the future of policing—and other documents that might be tabled during the talks process and might then be published—is a good example of trying to bring such issues into the wider debate between the parties round the talks table. The debate does not just belong to political representatives and to Governments, but to all the people of Northern Ireland and all the people of the United Kingdom, of which Northern Ireland is a part. Those people have a right to know what is said in their name by the Government, and that is why documents have been published. They are consultative documents—they are not the end result—but they do open up the debate in crucial areas, which is critical to the future of Northern Ireland.</span></p>
